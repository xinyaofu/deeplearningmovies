so ask yourself what  mm    eight millimeter   is really all about  
is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy  sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography  
is it about the business itself  how  bubbling just beneath the surface of bigtown americana  theres a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wont necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires  
or is it about those who can  those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see  
im not talking about snuff films  supposed  documentaries  of victims being brutalized and killed on camera  
im talking about films like  mm  and its director  joel schumacher  
with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit  batman  robin    a time to kill    batman forever    the client  schumacher certainly has that kind of influence  
is  mm  something you really want to see  
probably not  
the first twothirds of  mm  unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama  albeit with a particularly unsavory core  
then  as its been threatening all along  the film explodes into violence  
and just when you think its finally over  schumacher tags on a ridiculous selfrighteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further  
trust me  
there are better ways to waste two hours of your life  
nicolas   snake eyes   cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husbands safe documents a young girls murder  
welles goes about his assignment rather matteroffactly  and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly  almost as if you dont need any specialized skills or training to do this  
welles certainly makes it look easy  
and cops  obviously  never look in toilet tanks for clues  
the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes  like george c  scott in paul schraders  hardcore   
occasionally  a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector  reminding him of his unpleasant task  
there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife  played by catherine keener  who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly splitlevel home in harrisburg  pa  
  mm  doesnt condemn or condone its subject matter  it just exploits it  
the irony  of course  is that schumacher and  seven  scribe andrew kevin walkers vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an rrated  firstrun hollywood product  
so we only see snippets of snuff  and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror  
later its the turn of joaquin phoenix  whos quite good and by far the films most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california  to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again  
all this to get to the familiar yet offensive  revelation  that sexual deviants are not  indeed  monsters but everyday people like you and me  
neither super nor standard   mm  is shocking only in its banality
