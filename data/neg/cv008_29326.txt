call it a road trip for the walking wounded  
stellan skarsg  rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that its difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly  boozedout presence  
yet this everreliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen  a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama  
playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets  unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late  
thats an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for  focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father  tomas  skarsg  rd  and his alienated  openly hostile yuppie daughter  kaisa  lena headey  gossip   
they havent spoken in years  and wouldnt even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen  scotland by automobile if it werent for kaisas mother  charlotte rampling  under the sand  rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer  
in a soap opera twist  mother has only a few days to live  
  only in the movies  right   
too blitzed to even step foot on a plane  tomas hits the open road with kaisa  
loathing each other all the while  they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out  whenever he isnt muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be  
despite his sloshed viewpoint  tomas recognizes that the apple hasnt fallen very far from the tree  
kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke  sabotages her personal relationships through indifference  and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper  
aint they a pair  
unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the onenote and repetitively bitchy dialogue  screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward  lost money  roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around  nosy cops  and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative  
by the time they reach the hospital  its time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the fatherdaughter conflict  theyre also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe  
this revelation exists purely for its own sake  
aberdeen doesnt know where else to go  
weak  unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa  
if lena headey were a stronger actress  perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody  haunting cinematography  rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world  the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional   
headeys too busy acting  using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance  
if she were paying any attention to skarsg  rd  maybe shed figure out that doing less can reveal so much more  
its worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in   jonathan nossiters captivating signs  wonders  
its not just because skarsg  rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films  theyre not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen   
the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant  
in aberdeen  rampling is a luminous diva  preening and static in her hospital bed  
despite skarsg  rds solid performance as tomas  his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow  
theres genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs  wonders  allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity  
nossiters film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain  
if signs  wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas  at least its willing to stretch beyond what weve come to expect from traditional drama  
aberdeen is never half so ambitious  content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies  
when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life  
the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdans trite but occasionally useful grand canyon  where steve martins hollywood mogul pronounces   all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies   
even foreign films are taking that advice to heart
