she was the femme in  la femme nikita   
he was the baldwin in  backdraft    sliver   and  fair game   with cindy crawford   
together  anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make  shattered image  the biggest piece of hooey since the stallonestone  thriller   the specialist   
the film poses the question  what if the life youre living now is really a dream  and your dreams reality   
its either about a woman whos haunted by a recurring  and recurring and recurring  nightmare that shes a hired assassin  or its about a hired assassin whos haunted by a recurring  and recurring and recurring  nightmare that shes honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica  
it doesnt much matter and believe me by the time  shattered image  runs its painful and pedestrian course you wont care  
these two lives  with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig  black emotionless eyes  and black leather clothing in the seattlebased assassin scenes  and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes  play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is its now  twice  as boring as it might have been  
its not that complicated plots cant be entertaining  
of course it helps if you have interesting characters  crisp dialogue  and a modicum of style  
  shattered image  isnt complex  its just stupid  
and boring  
parillaud and baldwin  who arent exactly shakespearean material to begin with  are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines  
lines like  
  you dont beg  you insist  
i like that in a woman   
thats parillauds character talking    
to her cat  
and  
  youre not the reason i couldnt care less about you   
huh  
and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film  
  if you give me a couple of minutes you know ill charm the pants off you   
  i dont have that kind of time   
talking of pants  parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say  point of no return   
we have come to expect this from billy baldwin  but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first  
but theres nothing to learn  
karen is as interesting as a cereal box  a someonesouttogetme crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone  the stranger who sends her flowers  maybe even her husband himself  is her wouldbe killer  
siouxsie is the chromium cool  toughasnails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the films meaningless stock title  
baldwin seems more interested in parillauds nest egg  so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot  than he does in her  
each time graham greene shows up he gets killed  
barbet schroeder   reversal of fortune   coproduced and should be ashamed of himself  
every now and again its fun to watch a really bad movie  
and every now and again  as  shattered image  makes agonizingly clear  it isnt
