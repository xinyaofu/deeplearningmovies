so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful scifi films such as close encounters of the third kind    a space odyssey  apollo  and contact  
well  whatever it is  youd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange  considering the disastrous results were left with here  
this is a film that takes a little bit of everything  but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing  
its like i said    this 
movie sucks  
plot  a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year   after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet  
critique  extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie  
uneven  would be another  
the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise  the buzz around it had been soso  and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes  all leading you to believe that its actually going to go  somewhere   
but it isnt long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral  features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherrycolored planet  tries too hard to get us into the  pain  of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix  
in a scifi movie  
well  i dont know  much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half  only to figure out some big secret in the end  a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement  
ultimately  this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise  joins the crew in their  misadventures in space  for the main crux of its journey  and eventually settles down for one of the most anticlimactic endings this side of contact  
mind you  if you enjoyed that films shrugoftheshoulders ending  you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well  
of course  i dont remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story  
ugh  
what a friggin mess  
films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again  
didnt anybody recognize the crappiness in this script  
didnt they read the bad dialogue  the cheezy lines  the obvious derivative nature of the work  mind you  with a director like depalma at the helm  that aint saying much    
of course  you cant really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry oconnell in this fine crew of thespians  
nuff said  
neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the films musical score during the last fifteen minutes  presumably in order to wake the audience up  okay  we get it brian  this scene is supposed to be powerful    wow    yawn    my 
ears hurt    
so is anything salvageable in this movie  
sure  
gary sinise does another great job  as does cheadle  the film doesnt completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening  and yes  the  sandtwister  effect that you see in the commercial is well done  
other than that  
i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies    oops  
did i say  admire   i meant  am disgusted   
all in all  this movie delivers very little in actual substance  offers twobit dialogue masked in a lot of scifi mumbojumbo  pretends to be deep when really its just sappy  and eventually just settles into an ending which  other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story  gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck  
go see the ninth gate    now 
theres a great movie  
and on a personal note  i think its time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial minute uninterrupted film sequences  and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting
