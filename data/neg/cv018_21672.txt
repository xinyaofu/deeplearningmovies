the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by films end  
if youre not familiar with this law  then maybe youve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by films end  
now if youre a regular reader of mine  youve heard me say this countless times  you know how drive me crazy is going to end  but is the journey to get to that ending worth it  
no  it definitely is not  
melissa joan hart  from abcs  sabrina  the teenage witch   likes a hunky stud on the basketball team  
adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor whos just broken up with his activist girlfriend  
apparently he wants to make his exgirlfriend jealous enough to take him back  and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance  
so the two pretend to date for some reason  but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud  
will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends  
will this crazy scheme work  
do i care  
the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy  
what makes movies like cant hardly wait and  things i hate about you work  and to a lesser extent  shes all that and never been kissed  is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly  
i dont know what the writers intention was with drive me crazy  
there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to  
here theres nothing    
just teens whining about whos going to take them to the big dance  
do me a favor kids  go get a job or something    
just shut the hell up  
in all honesty  the best part of this film is the end credits  
now normally when i say that its followed with the joke     because the movie is finally over   
in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film  
after the obligatory second playing of britney spears titular song  theres a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school  
nothing great  but more entertaining than anything in the  minutes which preceded them  
scifi fans take note  there are brief appearances from stephen collins  star trek  the motion picture  and faye grant  the tv miniseries  v  and  v  the final battle
