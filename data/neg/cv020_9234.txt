  spawn  features good guys  bad guys  lots of fighting  bloody violence  a leatherclad machine gun chick  gooey  selfhealing bullet holes  scatological humor and a maneating monster  
it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of  and yearold boys  it appears to have been made by them  
in a classic example of telling and not showing   spawn  opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness  forces of light and how  men are the ones who create evil on earth   
so much for a message  
the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons  michael jai white   a government assassinoperative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn  martin sheen  who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip  while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant  
simmons goes to hell and back  after making a deal with satan himself  if he agrees to command the devils army to overtake the world  hell be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda  underused theresa randle  and little girl cyan  sydni beaudoin   
of course  seeing as how five years has passed  wanda has fallen for  and married  simmons partner  d  b  
sweeney   
his  uh  shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown  john leguizamo   a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satans  
clown manipulates simmons  now in superhuman spawn form  into a stand off with wynn  
wynn  who thinks he is in league with the doubledealing clown  recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart  when it stops beating  major cities around the world will detonate  causing the leak of a disease that  makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash   
phew  got all that  
it would be easy to dismiss  spawn  as just another one of those heavyonfx  shortonsubstance action pics  but it doesnt even work on that level  
the computergenerated sequences are often and plenty  and the problem is that they look too computergenerated  
the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic  with the movies healthy budget youd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks  
other elements of the movie are soso  spawns enormous red  flowing cape is a wonderful sight  but its too obvious when hes being played by a costumed actor or an image  
in movies like  contact   the special effects serve the story  
in  spawn   they are the story  
and spawn himself isnt even an interesting character  
the films reliance on razzledazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for  but both simmons and his funky alterego are completely underdeveloped  
what we need is a batman  a luke skywalker  
even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn  
poor leguizamo  
he starred in februarys  the pest   a movie that i still think is the years worst so far  although this one does give it a run for its money  
as clown  he overacts to the extreme  never missing an opportunity for a poortaste punchline  
leguizamo farts green mist  munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a miniskirt and performs a cheerleader routine  all before turning into a giant grey demon  
the guy was brilliant in  to wong foo  thanks for everything  
julie newmar   
what is he doing wasting his talent in this and  the pest   
im one of the few people that liked  batman  robin   this summers other bigbudget comic book film  
yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison  i can only hope people will change their minds and think of  batman  as the superior adaptation  
theres a compelling story somewhere in  spawn   including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first africanamerican superhero ever  but its just not found anywhere near here  
as it is   spawn  is just awful  it stinks worse than a dead trout
