  snake eyes  is the most aggravating kind of movie  the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing  
its not just because this is a brian depalma film  and since hes a great director and one whos films are always greeted with at least some fanfare  
and its not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance  this film is hardly worth his talents  
its worse than that  
its aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more  could be totally intelligent  and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely    then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of halfassedness  
or more deservedly  the hall of fame of the eighthassedness  
in certain circles   snake eyes  was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawas classic  rashomon   where a crime is told from the four different  and i mean different  perspectives  and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening  which  i might add  is superb  
in one very very very long steadicam shot  we meet the protagonist  crooked atlantic city detective  rick santoro  cage   and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife  interupts a payperview event on tv  chases down a gambler  enters the arena all pumped up for the fight  sits down and talks with his bud  kevin dunne  gary sinise  whos character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn  whos also in this   and watches as it happens  
theres a big name in the crowd  and thats the secretary of defense  charles kirkland  joel fabiani   whos sitting behind rick  and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion  lincoln tyler  stan shaw   is knocked out  
this all happens in the opening shot  and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction  
what really happened  this film asks  and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene    and 
discovers theres a very good possibility it was a conspiracy  
as we follow rick trying to learn of more information  we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot  carla gugino   and who flees the scene in a panic  and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casinohotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened  
this is all going pretty fine and dandy  and its extremely interesting to watch    then 
it takes one wrong step  
we follow the wrong character  and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on  and way before rick can find it out  
but thats not the worst part of it  its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring  the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it  
it only gets worse  the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film  and since we already know what happened  we cant rely on ricks investigation to be all that interesting  
its as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in  and decided to just fall back on an easy way out  and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible  
events become more and more proposterous  and by the end  the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this  the deux ex machina  
thats where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay  
this time  its a hurricane  an outofcontrol police car  and a big round ball that adorned the arena  
what went wrong  
depalma and the screenwriter  david koepp  are extremely credible people in their respective fields  and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this  
depalma  who idolizes hitchcock to death  has done many a film like this  such as his masterpiece   blow out   where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece  
but granted  depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch  what with his overthetop shot setups  notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel  forgetting anything about boundaries  
at least his direction makes up partly for it  
then theres koepp  who showed such great ability at making a characters flaws come to life like he did in depalmas earlier  carlitos way   a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well  
he can write a flawed character  but his rick santoro seems to be just a halfassed effort  
hes flawed  and we can see redemption if the story wasnt so formulaic  
a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup  
he may as well have said the opposite of what he says  it would have at least gone with what the character was like  
this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity  because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption  then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way  
as i was watching the first half hour  i couldnt wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed  how many different perspectives hed be given  and perhaps hed have to make a choice between whos he has to believe  
now theres a film  
unfortunately  the film has two major deux ex machinas  one in the disasterous ending  the other  about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap weve seen all too much before  but never from someone like depalma
