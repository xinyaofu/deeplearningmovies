a followup to disneys liveaction   dalmatians  thats better  more entertaining than the first  
just as unlikely  
with   dalmatians   the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs  more is definitely  not  the merrier  
s   dalmatians  certainly wasnt the greatest moviegoing experience of all time  but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous  largerthanlife performance  
in addition  we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson  and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies  
this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen  and closes facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the yearold actress under that startling black and white wig of hers  
but thats only half the problem with kevin limas laborious film  
what makes   dalmatians  such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor  here almost singlehandedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks hes a dog  voiced by eric idle   its rabid plotlessness  cruella goes after puppies again  winds up in goo again  and most of all  the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic  heroes  of the piece  a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blanderthanbland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo   
gruffudd is cute and harmless  perhaps  but evans cant even aspire to that  
the dogs upstage them both  of course  but in the case of evans  even closes split ends are more animated  
bad acting  however  seems to be a requirement for this sequel  since g  rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niros in  men of honor   
jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieus overthetop antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail  and wail for wail  
frances most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself  and in   dalmatians  the producers milk that realization for all its worthle pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as  poopies   par example  and ad nauseum   
the finesses of the script  attributed to four screenwriters no less  and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up  are quickly dispensed with  since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben     
that done  its back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore offlimits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown  
the dogs are pretty cutetry making a puppy look otherwisebut thats pretty much all they are  
theres always the feeling that theres a trainer off in the wings  coaxing the dogs to open doors  or pick up their food bowls in unison  or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder  
savvy holiday goers should skip   dalmatians  and pop the original  animated classic into  their  vcrs instead  
its one dalmatian less  but  more satisfying
