onesided  doom and gloom  documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible  
orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he  along with bestselling author hal lindsey  discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent  well for  anyway  events  
the film is dated badly  as many things that are supposed to happen in the  future  never do  
for example  the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year  and cause chaos here on earth  
were still here  
the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kickoff the apocalypse  
were still here  
some of the more ludicrous moments come when its alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist     
also  theres ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like  
if its anything like its depicted as here then its going to be incredibly boring  
the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video  
it contains the film in standard form  aspect ratio of        although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed  
also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey  as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release  chariots of the gods  
audio is mono dolby digital  and the video is fair to good for a film like this  
i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me  
certainly i never expected a remastered print  
curiously  the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case  
but theyre menu screens    
so who really cares
