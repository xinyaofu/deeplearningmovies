some movies i should just skip  
my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back  and here comes another disney effectsfilled liveaction flick based on an old tv program  
true  the probgram is only  years old this time  and its a cartoon  
but its a cartoon i liked  and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen  
but my daughter really wanted to go  and how bad could it be  
turns out i was right  mostly  
inspector gadget  oddly enough  follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian  down to the jivetalking sidekick  
at first i thought it was done by the same people  but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin  where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver  
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it  where  formula  isnt just business  its a way of life  
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits  
in some parts you can just hear them saying  more zany  
i want more zany here  and  here   
  lets have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here  make it really painful  
i want the audience squirming in their seats   
  ok  thats fine  but i want you to add bug guts   
  what does this scene do  
character depth  
but wheres the zaniness  
i dont see zany here  
if you cant make it zany  cut it   
the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie  
michelle  who plays penny  gadgets niece  shines in every scene shes in  but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time  
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor  
dabney colemans comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby  
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film  but instead  he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes  
he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the  gidget bitch from hell  town mayor  
oteris overly enthusiastic and continually selfcongratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland  oregons own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasnt poking fun at our fair town  
or  maybe all career politicians are like that  
i must say  matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla  
he appears to have some fun with the film  especially as the evil gadget  
rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw  
joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself  
her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film  
d  l  hughley plays the shuckinandjivin vehicular sidekick  in a role that firmly sets emancipation back  years  
the dialog is    lets face it  its pretty bad  
the tagline after a major setpiece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context  
a lot of the lines  especially hughleys  appear to be made up as they go along  by people with little gift for adlib  
about threequarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw  
gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations  not really  battles   with the evil gadget  
penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon  
let me rage here just for a minute  
michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character  
shes utterly charming  and has excellent experience  harriet the spy  for the part of the pintsize detective  
why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery  
the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting  or editing  stupidity  
inspector gadget is missing the long  long stretches of potty humor that  among other things  made my favorite martian so unbearable  but its a very short movie  so perhaps something was cut at the last moment  
probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits  
the  evil sidekick support group  is especially worth seeing  and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds its onscreen  
all in all  another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films  
i wonder if disney uses the revenues for its generally moneymaking cartoons to produce these losers  
but if true  why  
if theyre trying for another mary poppins  they need to find a team that can produce one  and then give them a chance to do it
