out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey  a cold  uninvolving  confusing new thriller  
though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard  author of out of sight  as well as jackie brown  get shorty and pulp fiction   after you watch it  you realize that its not nearly good enough  
in an aggressively nonlinear fashion  the limey  li  mey  noun  an english gentleman  tells the story of wilson  terrence stamp   a british excon just released from a  year stint in prison for armed robbery  
he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny  
he doesnt know much about the circumstances of her demise  all he has is a name  terry valentine  
valentine was jennys former boyfriend  a wealthy and corrupt record executive  
hes played by peter fonda  in his first major role since the terrific ulees gold in   
seeking valentines reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson  
he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party  
he winds up breaking his cover eventually  setting off valentines head of security and valentine himself  who decides to run for it  
what a mess  
i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time  pulp fiction  which twisted time every which way  was a masterpiece  but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer  
the limey does exactly that  
the plot is permeated with flashbacks  flashforwards and what can only be described as random timetravel  without any evident purpose  
there is no method to this movies madness  
it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably  
the plot isnt particularly interesting in the first place  traditional  mildly hackneyed and not very involving  
this is a sort of brooding film  our protagonist doesnt speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude  
i felt like the director wasnt very interested in the proceedings himself  almost like he made this film for a paycheck  
ditto for the editing  which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant  
sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal  
hes not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here  
peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor  hes shy  quiet but always effective  
hes adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression  his feelings dont always show on his face by you can always tell what they are  
this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion  
why soderbergh couldnt just parrot down and tell a story  i dont know  but what he does do certainly doesnt work  
the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil  even the action scenes dont work  
 may have signified the death of the traditional act one  act two  act three storyline  but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it  
shall we go back to basics
