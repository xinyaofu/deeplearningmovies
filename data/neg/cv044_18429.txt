im currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters  
in the wedding singer  she was julia gulia  
in never been kissed  shes josie grossie  
future db character names include  janet granite  janey grainy  and for that nc project in the works  jojo    
aw forget it  
ill stick to my day job  
this is a teen movie  all right  except the main characters arent teens  
drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter  only its very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters  
the story shes covering is not really a story  but a story in the making  
she is to return to high school as a student and explain whats really going on  
the irony is that drews character  was such a dweeb first time around  that she is terrified at going back  
when she does  she says the wrong things  wears the wrong clothes  and projects the  i know the answer  in class that popular kids  or at least popular kids in the movies  reject  
at least she befriends nerdy aldys  joan of arcs leelee sobieskiwatch for her   who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are  supposed  to be more beautiful than her  
what works  drews geeky oldself  
after a start in films that was headline driven  and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish character  its a surprise to see her with bad hair  big glasses and braces  
its very funny  
what doesnt work  drews geeky newself  
come on  
nobody dresses as bad as she does  
couldnt she just go to the gap and take suggestions  
had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better  
the comedy is supposed to progress when drews younger brother  played with zest by david arquette  reenlists to jumpstart his baseball career  
now  how in the world can somebody as nerdy  but in a funny way  as he can be the most popular kid in the school    
in a day   
the dialogue in the film is  well  an embarrassment  
her coworkers  molly shannon  john c  reilly and gary marshall  are in terminal hyperdrive  
her teenage peers  except sobieski  are so inept and stupid that theres little bite from them  
couldnt the filmmakers watch heathers first  
lastly  i am proud to say that i caught a significant gaffe in the film  
if you see the film  youd know what im talking about  
drew walks into a bar  has her hand stamped  and over the night associates with some rastafarians with some delicious  um  cake  
she goes wild  sleeps in late  
when she wakes  she rushes off to school  without showering  without noticing that her head  lying on her stamped hand all night  has transferred part of the stamps image to her forehead  spelling  loser   
funny  eh  
    except that the hand would have transferred that image backwords
