instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as  powerful  or  touching   
i have a name for it myself   gross   
this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully  the bully looks at the  rebel  threateningly  about to hurt him  and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too  
how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me  arent present day moviegoers beyond being  inspired  by something like that  
this is one example  there are actually some more in instinct alone  of filmmakers insulting the audiences intelligence  
instincts plot is brimming with potential  worldrenowned anthropologist ethan powell  anthony hopkins  disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa  
he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer  he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him  
after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport  the authorities stick him in a prisons  psychotics ward   
assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright  or so we are told  young psychiatrist theo caulder  cuba gooding jr    
caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career  
of course  and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way  he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison  
and then theres the inevitable  heartless meanie  character  in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulders mentor  
he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell  
lets get one thing straight  dr  theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen  on screen or off  
any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way  
not good old theo  
no  he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says  we need to talk about this right now   
this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instincts already dubious credibility  unfortunately its also the least of its problems  
director jon turteltaub  who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly abovepar cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that  contrary to what this movies promotion would have you believe  it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs  
its not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes  what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that  but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus  excuse the graphic depiction   
it aims to  inspire  rather than to touch hearts  
as yoda would say  inspire it does not  
it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter  the very experienced gerald di pego  has to resort to literally telling the audience a movies story  
indeed  somewhere in the beginning of instinct  one of the characters actually reads aloud the films plot to another character  
this  like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review  is a horrid insult to our intelligence  
i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation  
i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors  and he chews the scenery in this movie  brilliant as ever  
oscar winner cuba gooding jr  on the other hand is dreadful  
his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink  
i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling  
i love animals  and instincts prominent save the gorillaslive in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with  
however this movies execution is completely unacceptable  
tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick
