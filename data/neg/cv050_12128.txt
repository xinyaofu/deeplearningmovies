my giant is two movies for the price of one  but neither is worth the cost of admission  even if you get in free  
as lamely directed by michael lehmann  the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book  
   without goliath  david is just some punk throwing rocks    
languidly paced throughout  the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer  the omen  meanders toward its sad ending  
since its rarely funny or convincingly dramatic  what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery  
other than a few nice visuals  theres nothing to recommend the picture  
with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally  to the original city slickers  billy crystal has shown that hes more than the worlds best oscar host  
he does  however  have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last years fathers day and this years my giant  
one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project  
surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there  
perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success  
or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movies somber tone  
the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day  
this onejoke movies single idea is to place reallife basketball player gheorghe muresan  who stands seven and a half feet tall  into as many visually striking situations as possible  
sammy  crystal   an agent currently without clients  is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max  muresan   
after throwing out constant oneliners   either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car     
sammy decides to get serious  seeing max as his meal ticket  
and although he doesnt like it  hes willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a halfdozen dwarfs  
  the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever   
after a series of missed opportunities  the comedic part of the movie is over  and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie  
we learn that maxs condition is terminal  and he will soon die  
to be fair  the movie does contain a few good scenes  all of which you can see in the trailers  
lets hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie  
my giant runs too long even at just     
it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up  
my son jeffrey and his friend matthew  both   gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it  
matthew pointed out that it  is not as good as it could have been or should have been   
  amen   
he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle  
jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was
