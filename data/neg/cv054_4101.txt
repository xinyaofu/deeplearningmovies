has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears  
nineteen years and two mighty ducks later  the formula is still going strong  
police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a smalltown deputy sheriff corralled into cocoaching the schools hastily formed soccer team  
his partnerincrime is the new british  exchange teacher   olivia dabo   a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested  outercity audience is to teach them something neat  
like soccer  
most of the goodnatured gags are of the fastmotion variety  such as runaway cows and outofcontrol lawnmowers  
kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit  while their parents peacefully doze beside them  
other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed  whats missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy  
instead of a peppy pop score  which would arguably work to better effect  most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else  
comedy needs music  
just watch any old bugs bunny short  
the marx brothers knew it  
mel brooks knows it  
unfortunately  the current trend is to  overscore   
lush strings and booming brass in every scene  at every moment  
remember the simple strains of bizets  habanera  in the original bad news bears  
these days  its usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path  
much like adding frosting to already frosted cake  
an awfully big adventure  
the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral  
their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern  georgina cates  struggling to survive in postw  w  ii 
liverpool  
hugh plays the gay director  an  extremely  unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months  
bleak makeup and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into  
an awful adventure is not without  some  rewards  tho  
the peter pan subtext is intriguing  
as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth  alan rickman  and prunella scales  
basil  
devil in a blue dress  
the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough  except for the fact that this film isnt nearly as gripping  
writerdirector carl franklin  one false move  is the force behind this accomplishedbutstiff adaptation of walter mosleys crime novel  
denzel washington is as sturdy as ever  but hes burdened with a miscast supporting cast  
tom sizemore and scenestealer don cheadle are both fine  
the problems start with jennifer beales  who never registers as the plots femme fatale  
shes a pretty face and nothing more  
also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney  
they play opposing mayoral candidates in  los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles  
john huston  we miss you  
fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus  
they help to overcome a pace thats too polite for mosleys jazzy  swingin story  
steal big  steal little  
i cant say much about this one  
director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers  andy garcia  with opposing moral codes  
theyre fighting over their adoptive mothers estate  a   acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers  
so many different plots are trying to come togetherfeuding brothers  reconciling husbands  loanshark hired hitmenthat you have to admire the directors ambition  
too bad that almost every single person or plotline is out of sync  
that is  with the exception of alan arkin  
hes the best thing in a movie thatdespite the work of four credited writers  still  manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers  kevin mccarthy  and joe pantolinao  
and what the heck does that title mean
