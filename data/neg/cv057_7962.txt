supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in   
john patterson  val kilmer   the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation  tried to rid his operation of the lions  but fails  
a world renound hunter  remington  michael douglas   is called in and the battle  man against lion  begins  
this film has a great soundtrack  and wonderful scenery  
the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin  
we only see one side of each character  
kilmer is a bridge builder and thats all we see him as  
these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesnt even appear to be too upset about it  
and the plot  
its jaws  but with lions  
again were presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should  
it appears to kill men because it just likes too  
why  
who knows  
i guess there wouldnt be much of a story if it didnt  
the problem is that there isnt much of a story even though it does
