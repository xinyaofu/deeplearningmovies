traffic violation dr  daniels review of uturn 
dr  ds rating  critical condition  
okay  heres the deal  
ill be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then  
ill even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well  
i mean  hey  ive been known to stretch a weekend into a threeday outing  if friday looks to be a slow day  
and if monday aint looking like a pickmeup  well  ive been known to give martha nell a call and say   do me a favor  sweetheart  
bump old man fergusons boil lancing to tuesday morning  and tell miss audrey that ill swing by her house monday evening and see if we cant get her trick knee back in line   
a simple sentence like that  and ive got a nice fourday fishing trip with the boys  or more often than not  a trip up to cherokee  n  c   for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery  
but the point is  if you take a day off  do something different  
if youve worked yourself silly for months  relax a bit  
sleep in  
eat pancakes at noon  
microwave an egg in its shell  
watch pro wrestling with the sound off  
listen to some barry white records at high speed  
whatever  
but do not  under any circumstances  spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living  
and  if you do  dont make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time  
because i do not want to hear your sob stories  oliver stone  
you apparently thought you needed a break from making  important films   
cool  
so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie  
thats cool  too  
but  ollie  old sage  do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade  
im just eager to meet you one day  so i can buy you a stoli  look you in the eye and say   what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with uturn   
and ill stand there staring til i get a straight answer  
sean penn stars uturn  as bobby  a drifter whos had some troubles a while back  
hes heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose  stranding him in superior  arizona  held there by an  ignorant  inbred  turtleneck hick  of a mechanic named darrell  
while darrell puts a new hose on the ride  bobby walks into town to see whats cooking  
is it needless of me to say that superior  arizona  is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely  
probably not  
bobby meets up with grace  jennifer lopez   who invites him back to her place  for drapehanging and other domestic issues  
just as those issues are starting up  graces husband  jake  storms in  looking like checkout day of the elks lodge convention  
just beats bobby silly  
bobby takes to the road  only to meet up with jake again  and jake asks bobby to kill grace  
a little while later  grace asks bobby to kill jake  
them murderous arizonians  
gotta love em  
if any of this sounds familiar  congratulations  
you win a kewpie doll  
the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west  a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl  maker of the phenomenal the last seduction  
but the contest doesnt end there  guys and gals  
we get steals from russ meyer movies  where everybody in town is horny and sweaty  
we get the town from bad day at black rock  minus the train  plus busty women who can speak  
look at any schwarzenegger film  and youll see our hero  bobby  as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times  has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times  gets bit by a tarantula  gets shot at  and ends up with vultures circling overhead  all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick  
bobby as terminator  
stretch it a bit  and we have a fivefinger discount from doc hollywood  where the whole story occurs because of car trouble  forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic  
okay  hes working from a book  so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas  
i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative  
i just wish he hadnt brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toestub  
sean penn gives a great performance  and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be  playing overthetop caricatures of stereotype characters  
the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blanketyblank is going on  
too bad its not fun to watch when its happening to us    while 
we sit through this mess of a film  
uturn is not a bad film if youre a fan of technique  
its the oliver stone youve always known  
robert richardson is his usual cinematographer  and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick  great camera angles  shifting viewpoints  wicked colors  nice looking pictures  
but pictures of what  
i think id rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tiltowhirl point of this loser film  
plot twists are one thing  repetition is almost unforgivable  and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ive seen in the past five years  
oliver  i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at  
youve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie  and films like platoon  jfk  wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on  
your scripts are certainly respectable  your budgets are up there on the screen  and your actors dont dog it  
and i know that  maybe  with uturn  you were just kicking back  just having fun  
thats fine  
but dont do that with a movie with the potential of this one  
do some police academy sequel  imagine that   
do a big comedy  like a remake of its a mad  mad  mad  mad world  
but do not drop a limp uturn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as  an oliver stone movie   and not question why it stinks like weekold snook  
theres a right way to have fun  and a wrong way to have fun  
this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail
