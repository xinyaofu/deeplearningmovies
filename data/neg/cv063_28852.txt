would you believe  in real life  i mean  that if you were julia roberts  that youd be the ugly underdog to your sister  the creepy catherine zetajones  
let me tell you what reality is  
reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts  and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot  
thats reality  
americas sweethearts is the opposite of reality  a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy alsoran  presumably because she wears hornrimmed glasses and used to be overweight  uhhuh   
the plot follows two married  megamovie stars  gwen and eddie  zetajones and poor  poor john cusack  whose material gets worse every year   on the eve of their new star vehicles release  a film called time over time  
the only problem  gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation  and the press and public have not been forgiving  think meg and dennis   
gosh  and the director has vanished with the film  holding the only print hostage  
veteran pr agent lee  billy crystal  is called upon to clean up the mess  throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie  presumably distracting the stupid  stupid film critics into forgetting they havent seen the movie at all  
  note to sony  any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab   
and did i mention gwens sister kiki  roberts  is along for the ride  
and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way  
oh billy  youre a scamp  
the script youve cowritten with peter tolan  what planet are you from  
and bedazzled  need i say more   is a roast of hollywood and celebrity  sure  but its not a funny one  
yes  crystal tells us  hollywood is lying to our faces  
if you are surprised by this  you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine  
its about to expire  
aside from a scant few zingers  yeah  se  or winces rules    
americas sweethearts jokes arent funny  its pace is choppy  and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project  not for headlining star julia roberts  but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself  
i didnt time it  the movies not that bad   but its crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film  
bad move  billy  your jokes suck  
the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movies gags  and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene  how this movie earned a pg rating is a mystery to me  
julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friends wedding into a winning film  but not even that tooth smile can save her here  
obviously aware of the ugliness before him  director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria  as a lisping spaniard   christopher walken  the insane time over time director   and alan arkin  a new age guru in a fright wig  to crack wise  
none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken  azaria comes off as a preening queen when hes supposed to be macho  
as for roth  in case you dont know  went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio  revolution  which produced this work  
hes back behind the camera for the first time in  years  
itll probably be another  before hes back again  
i could drone on about how americas sweethearts will only appeal to the mouthbreathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies  but that would get old  
instead  ill settle for discussing the movies worst sin  that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable  not just in its plot but in its sentiment  
every single character in this film  with the arguable exception of kiki  is simply hateful  and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains  
when you leave the theater  youll ask yourself  too  why would i want any of these jerks to be happy
