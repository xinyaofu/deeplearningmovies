note to screenwriters and self  when you hit the big time  and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer  tell  em all to hit the road  
gilligan wrote the arbitrarilytitled home fries ten years ago  it was shelved until he found success as one of  the took a second look at gilligans  comedy   they read it again wearing rosetinted glasses  
drew stars as sally  a dim  but sweet   pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states  
the father of her child is dead  the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons  these flyboys scared him with their lowflying helicopter  
dorian  wilson  and angus  busey  were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother  ohara   
trouble is  sally picked up some interference on her drivethru headset  and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing  
so dorian goes undercover as a burgerflipper  before you can say  with cheese  he falls for the mothertobe  
too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally  
does this sound like a movie you want to see  
without a doubt  the best thing about home fries is barrymore  at the risk of sounding sexist  shes never looked better than here  as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes  
she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look applecheek cute and gawk at wilson  her reallife boyfriend  
but the plot and the situations are so offputting that nothing could save it  
this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers  but home fries brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel  
its raising arizona without babies  without charm  without laughs  without human characters  and without intelligence  worst of all  its creepy  
whats funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun  
  unless the woman in question is a spice girl   
take out the helicopters  the quasiincestuous relationship between the mother and her sons  it is absolutely illogical  within the movies framework  that dorian still lives with his mother and brother   and the scenes of murder  attempted and otherwise   and what are you left with  
the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint  but dreams of becoming a country singer   
that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made  but itd be better than home fries
