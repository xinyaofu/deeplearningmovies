it rocksactually  lots of rocks fly at us or from us  in slow or fast motion  at several points in the film  
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward  and when they landonce in a while  when we need a break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like  
  nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur   
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon  a steroid users answer to deep impact  
bruce willis stars as harry stamper  a famed oildriller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond  zero barrier  and destroys our planet  
why an oil driller  
they require someone experience with deepcore mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid  
  in one unintentionally    
hilarious sequence  nasa asks harry to inspect a deepcore driller they built based on his blueprints  it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it  
we trust nasa to build space shuttles   
harry assembles the obligatory  ragtag  bunch of  cowboys   including a blond guy  a fat guy  a black guy  a wiseass  and the man who is sleeping with his daughter  affleck   
once they reach space  we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it  i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes  
whether or not they save the day  i will not reveal  
nor will you care  
i will say this  you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope  
willis has barely a chance to come alive  ditto for affleck  
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act  in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material  
steve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic  
  rockhound   as hes called  is sarcastic and foolish  so they tape him to a chair  where he spends most of the film  
so why did they bring him up there to begin with  
rather  why write him into the film  give 
his almostwitty oneliners to serious willis  who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies  at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter  firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig  
im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel  at least in my world where the sky is blue  
liv tyler is pretty and humourless  as always  suspiciously  four of her fathers bands   aerosmith   songs grace the soundtrack  
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick  like ketchup  eventually drowning the movie onscreen  
  the middle hour is a nonsensical  pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain   
whenever someone dies in this movie  a crew member inevitably yells out  we lost  insert dead persons last name here    
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oilguycumastronaut from a live one  and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance  as their skin was often covered in fake blood  
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla  
it looks nicer  and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework  
it has a vivid soundmix  
but at almost twoandahalf hours  i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story  
the love story has been played up in the ads  perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanicfever  
bollocks  
the lovers in the film are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a mooncrawler  
remember a little film called jaws  
in this film  three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark  
they didnt much like each other at first  eventually  they started to respect one another  
one of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories  
this is the sort of malebonding foreign to bay or his producer  jerry bruckheimer  who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end  
not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesid be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before  action  was called  
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls  who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery  
to this  i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic  nor brave  nor smart  even  this team couldnt build a birdhouse  
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life
