theres a   foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact  
id say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies  which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release  
the early wave of this revival  while just as cheesy and laughable  at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes  
deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama  with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking  
the repeating cycle is as follows  the president  morgan freeman  will go on tv and tell the country that theres a remote chance a comet will strike the earth  but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  
then we get to see the plan in action  in some sequence utterly lacking suspense  
the mission will barely fail  and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth  and theres a remote chance it will strike  but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  
it goes on and on throughout the movie  but every time freeman goes on tv  we know his plan is going to fail  
how do we know this  
because weve seen the tv ads for deep impact  ads that feature freeman telling the nation that  the comet is still headed right for us  and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading  
ladies and gentlemen  that is the movie  
successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow  but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its second tv spots  
television is whats wrong with deep impact  
the main character  played by tea leoni  is a lowlevel broadcast journalist for msnbc  and thats the mere tip of the productplacement iceberg  who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy  
she thinks its an instance of an exsecretary of something or other  james cromwell  resigning because of a mistress  and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area  
when she goes nosing around cromwell  he begs her to keep it under wraps  
  i know youre just a reporter  but you used to be a human being   
she figures out whats really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search  where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction level comet  
upon a topsecret meeting with president freeman  leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference  at which she gets to ask the first question  
and everyone knows  if you get to ask the first question  baby youre a star  
leoni ends up in the anchor chair  broadcasting every step of the comets collision course with earth  
and im sure its comforting for her to know that  even though the worlds ending in a matter of months  shes a cable news personality  
so there she is  narrating the sixastronaut mission to blow the comet up  
such personalities as robert duvall  jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this draggedout process  
but as anyone whos seen the commercials knows  the astronauts fail  
they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces  which means even more destruction to the earth  
yeah  thanks  nasa  
thats when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who arent picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years  
they even have animals  two by two  ready to climb into the cave  
if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed  deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie  
instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife  while people pack the highways out of town  
the reasoning is  of course  that if a comet is going to strike  they might as well be out in some scenic rural location  
and  amusingly  the highway is spotted with people in uhaul trucks  
im sure its comforting to know that  even though the worlds ending in a matter of minutes  the uhaul people are doing the most business of their lives
