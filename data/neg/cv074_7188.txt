for better or worse  the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated  oversexed  underwritten thrillers  
apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesnt change a thing  since body of evidence wasnt written by him  but has a puzzling eszterhasish presence all over it  
in other words  its a  really dirty and b  really  really stupid  
madonna  first warning sign  stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job  she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around seminaked  presumably for the edification of the shrimp  
shes been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover  
already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect  the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless shes under thirty  or at least looks it   and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men  
whats worse is that the movie confirms all the above  and wallows in them as well  
madonnas character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition  
  and yes  there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy  
this movie leave no scummy stone unturned   
anyway  willem dafoe  very good but completely wasted  also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonnas sexuality  
how do we know this  
because his character is set up with the token wife and kids  
how obvious is it that hes gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up  
and get kicked out of the house  
and get welcomed back anyway  
dont skip to the end yet  were just getting warmed up  
dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie  
most of it is about as erotic as openheart surgery  since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax  always the kink of choice among screenwriters who dont know the first thing about  really  kinky sex  and smashed light bulbs  
dont ask  
another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story  its insanely dull  
whats worse is that body of evidence is dull  everywhere   not just in the sex scenes  
the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninthhand from other bad courtroom drama scenes  
the thriller business itself is ridiculous  it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs  and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor  
and the ending  another homage to eszterhas  maybe  
 is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact  frame  where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in  
the director is uli edel  all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f  everyone has to eat  i guess  but this isnt a meal ticket  its leftovers
