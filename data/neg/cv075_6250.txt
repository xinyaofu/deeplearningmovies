it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable  
the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed  
it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers  james horner  
what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of   
what drags braveheart down is its screenplay  
it abounds with high production values  john tolls awardwinning cinematography  which also graced edward zwicks  legends of the fall   a gorgeous score by horner  and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names  
but this does not save a misguided script  
the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero  but the viewers only response to his  heroism  is intellectual  william wallace  producerdirector mel gibson  is fighting for freedom and against tyranny  so we have to root for him  
but wallaces actions paint a different story  
he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance  
though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side  the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait  in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king  
wallace speaks of freedom  but his acts point toward vengeance  
after kicking the english out of scotland  he decides to invade england  
this is evident of a  spartacus complex   and this example applies both historically and cinematically  
the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities  the film spartacus  like braveheart  has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay  
it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film  
horners score tries to make emotional connection  but the performances and the script do not help  
gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him  
this drags down any emotional connection to the films plot  and turns three hours into a total waste of time
