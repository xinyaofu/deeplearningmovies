susan grangers review of  the watcher   universal  
just what we need  another lurid  trashy serial killer saga  
this time  keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome tickingclock catandmouse game with james spader  a burntout fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd  
to taunt spader  who has relocated to chicago  reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too  
before long  he starts mailing photographs of the lonely  unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims  challenging spader  along with the chicago police department  to stop him within  hours before he strikes again  
in the midst of this murderous frenzy  theres spaders psychologist  played by marisa tomei  who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in  the cell   
writers david elliot  clay ayers and darcy meyers  along with firsttime director joe charbanic  helmer of music videos for reeves band dogstar   dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase  revealing  early on  exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop  need each other to give meaning to our lives   
plus  as reeves explains   were all stacked right on top of each other  but we dont notice each other any more   
after that  its all sound effects and tricky camerawork  along with a muddled  discordant soundtrack  
james spaders acting technique can be described as wooden deadpan while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone dude persona which sometimes works  sometimes doesnt  
chris ellis  as spaders selfimportant colleague  is the only cast member who manages to be convincing  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    the watcher  is an appallingly awful  amateurish   the real torture is watching it
