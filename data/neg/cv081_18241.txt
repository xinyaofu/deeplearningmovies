coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers  relentless   low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz  played by character actor leo rossi  spawned three more sequels  
relentless   third in the row  features sam dietz again  but this time detective  who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case  doesnt want to deal with similar line of work  
divorced  demoralised and transferred  he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer  and evidence indicate connection with one of dietzs old cases  
to make things even more interesting  it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation  
fans of the british tv films and miniseries like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies  
they both feature vicious psychopathic killers  yet also give a lot of  usually depressive  details about chief investigators private lives  
this one isnt an exception  but similarities with british television are only in content  
the execution and style is different  which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best  
useless  gratuitous erotica also doesnt help either  obviously making this film longer than it should be  
the actors are good  though  leo rossi is fine as usual  and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career  
signy coleman as dietzs love interest  is  on the other hand  quite miscast  
but she wont have to worry about it in the future career  since relentless  wasnt supposed to be anybodys finest moment anyway
