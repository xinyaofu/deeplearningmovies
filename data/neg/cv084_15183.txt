brian de palma  the director who bought us carrie  dressed to kill and mission  impossible is back  and has bought all his technical expertise with him  
sadly  he forget to bring a good story and believable characters  
nic cage plays rick santaro  a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne  sinise   
an assassination takes place  and santaro tries to peace together how it took place  trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy  
the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together  
however  the film doesnt keep the mystery for long  and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne  the film is at a dead end  
although there are some fantastic shots by de palma  including a  minute steadicam shot at the start of the film  halfway through the film drops dead  
the problem is that de palma doesnt have a strong story or characters to work with  
he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques  but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience  and i quickly got bored  
nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters  but its no use  
they are boring  faceless  and completely unlikeable  
yes  another problem with the film is that theres noone to root for  
were supposed to be on cages side  because his character becomes nicer throughout the film  
however  his change is sadly unbelievable  
poor gary sinises character is terrible  who completely changes throughout the start  the middle and the end  in an appalling way  
the films use of flashback quickly gets boring  
while clever and interesting the first few times  it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go  
they certainly dont increase the tension or suspense of the movie  
there is small thread of suspense running through the film  but it certainly doesnt make this film a powerhouse thriller  rather just a slightly below average one  
the script is lousy and contrived  the characters flat and two dimensional  
certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller  
the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential  
theres a good story buried in snake eyes  its just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks  
it also gives itself away far too quickly  rather than leaving the big twist for the end  
while the performances are intriguing  especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case  theres no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance  and unless youre a big fan of either cage or flash directing  should be avoided
