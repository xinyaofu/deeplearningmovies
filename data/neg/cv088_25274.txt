the first film produced by adam sandlers happy madison production company  clever title eh   is essentially a one joke movie  much like the movies sandler stars in himself  
however the difference here is that this one joke just isnt very funny  
rob schneider stars as the title character  a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a  manwhore  to raise enough money to replace a wealthy clients custom made fish tank  which deuce destroyed while staying in his home  
deuce goes on numerous  dates   and each woman he goes out with has a  humorous  quirk about herself  
one has narcolepsy  one has tourettes syndrome  one is a man    
etc  etc  
my problem is that we see all of these women in the films trailer  so why do i need to watch the movie  
seen the trailer    
seen the film  
only a quick cameo from norm macdonald  and a follow up joke during the closing credits  generates any chuckles  
deuce bigalow  male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video  a division of diney   
the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of       and features the original theatrical trailer  as well as trailers for mystery alaska  happy texas  and outside providence   an extremely brief production featurette  which contains footage not used in the film   and storyboardtoscene comparisons  
yep  you read that right    
there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd  
two scenes are storyboarded    
neither of which are particularly exciting  
there are fight scenes in this movie  so why arent we seeing storyboards of those segments  especially the parody moments from the matrix   
i wonder whats funnier  the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that diney thought fans of this film would want to see them  
deleted scenes  
sure  
audio commentary  
you betcha  
but storyboards  
come on  
r
