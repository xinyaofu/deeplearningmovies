tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out  minutes into the movie  
the film  which opened in canada during  but was never released in the united states  is based on a  stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage  and  while its evident that this could be a fascinating live production  the translation to the screen is a creative disaster  
enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art  lifeless and tedious  
the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium  
tectonic plates has a storyline  although the narrative is developed in a decidedly nontraditional fashion  with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences  
its not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie  despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious  allbutscreaming   look  
art     
although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters  
because were constantly made aware that were watching a play or a movie  its impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas  
theyre not real  sympathetic  or believable  
im willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different  but this particular experiment is not a success  
tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine  marie gignac   an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor  jacques  lapage   
one day  he disappears  and  fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love  madeleine travels to venice to kill herself  
while preparing to commit suicide  she encounters drug addict constance  celine bonnier   who causes madeleine to rethink her decision  
meanwhile  jacques has moved to new york city  where he starts crossdressing  calls himself jennifer  and becomes a successful counterculture talkshow host  
with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland  supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deafmute  and cultural references that point to chopin  george sand  and jim morrison  tectonic plates is unique  if nothing else  
however  as interesting as the film sounds  and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising   it never really delivers  
the tone is soporific  the supposedlyintellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting  the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner  although it doesnt take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant   and the symbolism is obvious  
tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth  but it takes onehundred minutes to get across this transparent point  
there are some worthwhile moments  such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages  although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who arent bilingual   
the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because  a  its different   b  its not like anything theyve seen before  and  c  its pretentious  
for everyone else  its not only a waste of time  but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage
