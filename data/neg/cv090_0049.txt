various films seen at the seattle film festival  
its all truethree men on a raft  u  s  a     director  orson welles 
a recently uncovered onefourth of orson welles planned  docudrama  of amazing stories around the world named its all true  this short dealt with welles attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in  who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft  
while several clips of the film are seen  the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welles attempts to film it  despite studio problems  a staggering workload  and extremely ill fortune on the set  
impressive photography  but really only interesting to film historians  
sadie thompson  u  s  a     director  raoul walsh screenwriter  raoul walsh  from the john colton play  rain   based on w  somerset maughams story  miss thompson  cast  gloria swanson  raoul walsh  lionel barrymore silent 
after the discussion of the newlyrestored version of frank capras lost horizon  where several scenes had been restored using stills  i was interested to see sadie thompson  where the last  minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago  
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story  miss thompson   
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seenlittle awkwardness  and a very clever script  
the actors  gloria swanson  raoul walsh  who also directed and wrote the screenplay  and especially lionel barrymore  as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadies soul  but really wants to get her between the sheets  is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel  
swanson adds real life to the character  adding an worldly  affectionate air to the bawdy sadie  
unfortunately  the ending is rather poorly tied up  it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of liveaction film  or the original script  
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on  i cannot believe maughams short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia   the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion weve been waiting an hour and a half for  
still  its entertaining right up to the end  certainly barrymores incredibly hammy performance  which  nonetheless  works  perhaps due to the silent screen  is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells  bakkers  and robertses of the religious worlds  
a c movie  worth    if you can find it  
the pied piper  czechoslovakia    director  jim barta screenwriter  kamil piza 
this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids  
it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate  and with a lot of political comment along with it  
perhaps economic content is a better wordit certainly doesnt show capitalism in a good light  
nor human nature  nor anything else  for that matter  
as you may have guessed  this is not a tgif film  this is the kind of film you are glad is over  
not that it wasnt interesting for technical reasons  this is stopanimation that is very well done  
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnutsexcept for the animated stuffed rats  
boy  sounds like a real comedy vehicle  doesnt it  
add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison  and you have something to give the wee ones  and some of the mentally unstable larger folk  to keep them up at night  
some gore  
dont bring children to this one  
dont bring adults to this one  unless theyre fascinated by puppetry andor hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped  
blech  
  no fun whatsoever  
meier  west germany    directorscreenwriter  peter timm cast  rainier grenkowitz  nadja engelbrecht  alexander hauff  thomas besvater subtitled 
this film takes us back and forth over the east germanwest german border with meier  an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money  
his uncle  also in the west  sneaks meier out of the country  unknown to the east germans  
meier  however  is less than thrilled his girlfriend  his friends and his job  which he likes  all exist in east germany  
after a roundtheworld trip  his boss thinks hes on leave in bulgaria   meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id  and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crews workwhile everyone thinks hes still living in east germany  
of course  something goes wrongand the ending is very funny  but it takes the film too long to get there  
the humor is spread too thin  and much of the plot is too obvious  as is the acting   
still  a good concept for the comedy  and the last five minutes are pretty funny  
c      
the right hand man  australia    director  di drew screenplay  helen hodgman cast  rupert everett  hugo weaving  arthur dignam  jennifer claire  catherine mcclements 
after a lifetime of moviegoing  and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival  ive learned several rules which  while not absolute  should certainly be given deference to  
  be wary of french comedies  
these people like jerry lewis  
  ken russell is never going to grow up  no matter how long you wait  
  any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as  old poutylips  is probably not worth watching  
  when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography  watch out  
australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo  but since weir and miller left for foreign shores  finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult  not impossiblewitness malcolm last year  task  
well  i ignored rules    last night  and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards  
its as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the s about tragedy among the gentry  and falling in love with people below your station  and horses  
lots and lots of horses  
the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship  which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing  because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir  
unfortunately  said son  a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times  kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident  
highlights include the amputation sequence  the doctors daughter  who has the hots for the son  tasting his urine for a diagnosis  their tender kissing with a window between them  while its rainingyoud think a woman studying medicine would know better   
the photography is good  but i kept wishing for bweverything seems sepiacolored anyway  
actually  i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead  but thats life  
grade  z  avoid like the plague  unless youre looking for inadvertent yuks
