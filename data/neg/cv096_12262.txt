much ado about nothing  
ah  how sweet the irony  
its accepted wisdom in some circles  among english literature nuts  mainly  that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance  
he just doesnt  understand  shakespeare  you will hear them say  
the bards work is apparently beyond criticism  
what a load of old cobblers  
if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaughs film of shakespeares  comedy  much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word  its time to get a life  
get monty python  
get woody allen  
get john waters  
whatever  
just get a real taste of some clever  witty  risky comedy  
and banish this nonsense to where it belongs  
drama and tragedy was shakespeares strength  
to my sensibilities  and im no stick in the mud  much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever  
no kidding  this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my  years of movie going  
the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend  as this was our day out and i hadnt seen her in ages  
but boy  does she owe me one  
i wont spend too much time on the plot  
basically  we follow the trials and tribulations of two wouldbe couples  one young  the other older  
theres some dark treachery amongst all this  but everyone is so awfully jolly that youd hardly know it  
mind you  theres nothing wrong with the basic story  
good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound  
nothing wrong with most of the cast  either  
branaugh  emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers  
the problem is the script  or more accurately  shakespeares original text  
light comedy shouldnt be complex  
yet wrapped in elizabethan english  the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend  
for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good  undemanding laugh  
the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves  the actor once again miscast as a jealous halfbrother or something  
but when dissected and understood  what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame  
this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold  
ho  ho  ho  boy likes girl  
ho  ho  ho  men are such klutzes  
ho  ho  ho  shes so awfully clumsy  
oh please  
theres wit in here somewhere  im told  
i call it pretentious  
something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay  
in the end  its cringeworthy  
watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience  
comedy  
bah  humbug
