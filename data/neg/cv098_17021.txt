  love to kill  starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes  
at the outset  the movie appears to be about tony danza  whos an illegal distributor of guns  trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman  
danza sets up a double date with her  her sister  and a collegue of his  
everything seems to be going well  until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs  
much confusion and mahem ensues  as the death is covered up and other associates of danzas begin to emerge  all after one thing or another  
sound confusing  
it is  
i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity  
in some respects  it works  
but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess  
characters keep popping up with no explanation  demanding money for deals that occur offscreen  
the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister  
but so little time is devoted to this part of the story  we never really become too familiar with these characters  and because of this  we dont really care what happens to them  
well  i didnt  at least  
one thing i will give the movie is that its a complete departure for tony danza  
heres a guy  because of his many sitcom roles  whos ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing  
here  he plays a man whos just looking out for himself  and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin  so be it  
i was very impressed by his performance  and within minutes of the start of the film  i had forgotten all about his goodguy persona  
michael madsen is also good as an associate of danzas who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him  
like i said  its not exactly a linear storyline  
  love to kill  should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre  but its just too bad that the story doesnt really add up to much  
the stars deserved better  and so did the audience
