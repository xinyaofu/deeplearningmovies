whether you like the beatles or not  nobody wants to see the bee gees take on some of the fab fours best known songs  
well  maybe thats not true  
  
  
maybe youre curious  the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose  
you just have to know how bad bad can be  
if thats the case  rejoice  because it was twenty years ago today  or so  that sgt  
peppers lonely hearts club band was released  unleashed   to the world  and thanks to our modern technological advances  you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs  
derived from the lyrics of various beatles songs  sgt  
peppers tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song  and album  of the same name  released in   
of course  the movie was made eleven years later  the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts  peter frampton is the one and only billy shears  and aside from being about a rock band  the story doesnt correlate to the song at all  
and oh  what joy  were the lovely audience theyd like to take home with them  
i dont think so  
but at least these characters are actually  people  in a beatles song  whereas other characters such as strawberry fields  sandy farina  gets her name from a song about a  place  called strawberry fields  
the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it  because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes  embarrassing cameo appearances  george burns   
steve martin    
alice cooper       and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy s fashion and faces  
check please  
the plot is a bit unclear  
people with bad s hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of makebelieve from an overly demented mr  rogers  
mean mr  mustard  frankie howerd  somehow gets hold of all billy  co  s instruments  calling dr  maxwell edison  steve martin with a silver hammer and an outofkey singing voice   the sun king  marvin sunk  alice cooper    and a couple of creepy robots to his aid  
supposedly this is a horrible thing  
i guess in heartland  the talent is pretty nonexistent  
meanwhile  the lonely hearts are off doing the classic  sex  drugs  and rock n roll  thing  leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love  billy  
she sets out to find him  leaving her poor dad and mom  mrs  
fields  
hey  wanna cookie   
all alone to sing a horrible rendition of  shes leaving home   accompanied by those same creepy robots  
but is billy getting it on with lucy  dianne steinberg   
ya know  the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky  
well  theres some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop  and i assume thats who it was  
its movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question   what the hell were they thinking     
nobody will ever know  but as a novelty  sgt  
peppers is one to examine  
carol channing  robert palmer  keith carradine  theyre all here  
but why     
who knows  
its irrelevant  
theres as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your bellybutton lint  although the latter may be more interesting  
with the recent onslaught of s nostalgia in the movie world  the ice storm  boogie nights  reissues of the star wars trilogy  etc    lets pray this doesnt get a special th anniversary  secondchance in theaters  
in the words of paul mccartney  live and let die  
in fact  bury this one while you still can
