    the following review contains spoilers    
  its just    
the way    
we are   
 a rapist  matt frewer  responds to supergirls  helen slater  query as to why shes being attacked  an example of the mindnumbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
ill admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know its hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor  but i still think its a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl  a spinoff film of sorts from the series same producers  alexander and ilya salkind   doesnt even rival superman iii in terms of quality  let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city  a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in  inner space   go about their daily lives  
ok    
what  
so these are exiles from krypton  which blew up right  
were they living there before krypton exploded  
how do you get to  inner space   
this whole  inner space  notion is never explained  particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went  
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet  
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city  zaltar  peter o toole   gives the omegahedron to supermans cousin  kara  helen slater   for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a buglike thing which immediately crashes through the layer of  whatever  that protects the city  
in the chaos  the omegahedron sails out through the opening  dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time  or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minorleague witch named selena  faye dunaway  who  immediately before her dip was ruined  announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel  peter cook   
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans  and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth  and that shes arrived as supergirl  complete with appropriate costume   
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh  
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake  
attention movie  explain yourself  
im sorry  i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i cant buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity  supergirl basically  wills  herself into a school girl outfit  complete with a different hairstyle   picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school  
shes given her dorm assignment  and who happens to be her roommate  
lois lanes sister  lucy  
ok  coincidence is one thing folks  but were getting really contrived now  
what follows are some generic allgirls school hijinks    
complete with evil bully girls  mean for no reason  of course  and even a shower scene     
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks  
at this point im rapidly wondering why im bothering with this nonsense  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an  evil  bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its  prey  is very well done  
also  its commendable to see genders reversed in the film  whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools  
hart bochner  die hard  is particularly fun as karas love interest  a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena  although he is unfortunately part of one of the films more ridiculous moments  when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some  menacing  bumper cars   
then there were numerous little things that bothered me  
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment    
its all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires  
instead of having her look like shes flying  the filmmakers wanted her to be  graceful   so she poses a lot and does ballettype maneuvers  
also  who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth  
a pair of truck driversrapists who immediately attack her and then meet a  wacky  demise  
there is also some rampant product placement in the film  most notably for popeyes  tylenol  and aw root beer  with the latter actually putting its logo on the tshirt of one of the rapists      
finally  just one word  monsters  
faye dunaway and peter otoole ham it up unmercifully  however when otoole overacts hes entertaining and when dunaway does it shes annoying  her character actually says the line  seize them   
at one point   
dunaways henchmen  played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro  fare much better  with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beattys otis character from the first two superman movies  
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent  naive character shes written to be  as shes able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable  
believability aside though  its still annoying  
now despite all this negativity  and im not alone here    supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles   leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested  but excited about its release on dvd  
they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd  to the delight of many people  including myself    
yet im still unclear as to why  since this movie is so awful   
the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs  minutes longer than the print which ran in u  s  theaters  
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of       is enhanced for x televisions  and has been remastered in full thx glory  
extras on the disc include  a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and  special project consultant  scott michael bosco  the excellent minute documentary from  called supergirlthe making of a feature  dig that workout montage     trailers   tv spots  talent bios  indepth storyboards  accompanied by score from the movie   and assorted still galleries  
the transfer on this international version is incredible    
youd think you were watching a new release  
images are sharp  colors jump off the screen  and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts  
only some special effects sequences show the wear of time  and there just isnt much that can be done about that  unless youre obsessive like george lucas   
the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places  however youll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score  which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films golanglobus production   
the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries  
bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that theres no dead air on the track  
bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen  and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation  
although  at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc  and is surprised when he doesnt get that response  
we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track  most notably the  almost  appearance in the film by christopher reeve  
great detail is given about supermans proposed role in the original script before reeve  wisely  dropped out  
as it stands  superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission  
for the sake of brevity  i wont even get into that one  
szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds  and everyone else agreed  that supergirl needed to stand on its own  replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy  whimsical fantasy  nonsense  
bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along  claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office  
again  for the sake of brevity  i wont even get into that one  
anchor bay has also released a limited edition  only    copies pressed  twodisc set  
disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release  
disc two features the never before seen directors cut of the film  which runs  minutes long  
the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which dont add much of note  except for a few moments which lengthen peter otooles screen time  particularly during his latter appearances   
the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono  but fans of the film wont care  
one question though    
shouldnt the directors commentary be on the directors cut of the film  
id never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd  
i was nine when it was released to theaters  and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it  
so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect  
i knew the film wasnt beloved and i never had any interest in it before  but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc  
as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence  which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong  
come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo    
so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started  
at the end of the film  supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron  and flies back to argo city  
ugh  i give up  
im surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once  not twice  but three times to review these discs  
supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package  but a very lousy movie
