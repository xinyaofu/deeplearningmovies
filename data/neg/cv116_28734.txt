a remake of the  warren beatty vehicle  heaven can wait   which in turn was a remake of  here comes mr  jordan     down to earth  tells the tale of lance barton  chris rock   lethal weapon iv    a young black standup comic trying to win over the audience at harlems apollo theater  
when hes taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes  eugene levy   best in show    his only recourse is to return in another body  
he chooses that of charles wellington  the tenth richest man in the united states  
of course  wellington is not only rich  but white and  years old  which makes lances bid for closing night at the apollo  as well as his desire to woo suntee  regina taylor   jerry maguire    a tad tricky  
the original elaine maywarren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock  lance crouther  ali leroi  and louis c  k  
to turn beattys vehicle as a football player into rocks vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor  
as directed by chris weitz and paul weitz  codirectors of  american pie  and costars of  chuck  buck    the whole affair comes off as amateur hour  
initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals  
production values are shoddy  
most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate  
this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen  
rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick  such as his turnaround on wellingtons plans for a poor neighborhood hospital  bullet in the head  
you got a bed     but hes uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast  
regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis  
also good is frankie faison   hannibal   as whitney  lances compassionate manager  the only human whos made privy to lances body body switch  
chaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heavens ambassadors  
another  best in show  alumnus  jennifer coolidge  is poorly used as wellingtons cheating wife  and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit    and greg germann  tvs  ally mcbeal    sweet november   continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husbands lawyer  
mark addy   the full monty   is sorely underutilized as cisco  wellingtons fake english butler  
stealing the show in every scene shes in is wanda sykes   the chris rock show   as wellingtons disgruntled maid  
  down to earth  is for chris rock fans only  
all others should go rent  heaven can wait  or truly be brought down to earth
