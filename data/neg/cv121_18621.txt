critique  despite this films interesting premise and dark subject matter  this movie sucks because it is unfunny  boring  and presents us with one of tom everett scotts worst acting performances  
add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element  many lame and corny jokes  a long wait for the setup  and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this  black comedy   if youre gonna create a black comedy  dont chicken out in the endsee very bad things    for a perfect example   and youve got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter  
i barely laughed at any gags  found the bong element contrived and repetitive  and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie  if youre gonna make a bad college comedy  at least slap in some free ta shots for the kids    
this ones not even worth the rental  fellas  
skip it altogether
