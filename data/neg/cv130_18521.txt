i never understood what the clich   hell on earth  truly meant until very recently  
ive just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying  so horrible  so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as  hell on earth   
after all  ive never been to war  ive never been the victim of any violent crime  ive never really been broken hearted  and ive never been audited  so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was  hell on earth  
then i saw cruel intentions  
in a perfect world  i would be in charge of all the movie studios  
the very first thing id do in this perfect world  would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv  and throw them in jail  
but it wouldnt just be your average jail  not even a maximum security installation  
id have these producers  and everyone else involved in the production of these films  put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity  
now youre probably thinking to yourself   is this really how bad cruel intentions is   
the answer is no  
its actually much worse  
watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound  
and then pouring acid on the salt  
i dont know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum  tara reid  whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet  but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom  
from that opening scene  where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz  to the conclusion which i dont remember because i had practically fallen asleep  cruel intentions is truly  hell on earth   right up there with war and tax audits
