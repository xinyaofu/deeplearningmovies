heres a concept  jeanclaude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie  
now if that isnt enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie  i dont know what is  
all sarcasm aside  it is certainly a different way to start a movie  of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother  so lucky us  we get to see more of jeanclaude  
van damme  works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives  
van damme  is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after  gets killed in france  
the remaining twin  the french cop  goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death  
once there  he hooks up with his deceased brothers girlfriend  played by natasha henstridge  and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are  
jeanclaudes acting abilities dont seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie  
in other words  just in case you missed the sarcasm  his acting is worse than normal  
on the upside  natasha henstridge is in this film  and she does what she did best in species  she gets naked  
sadly  this is probably the high point in the movie  
she is actually a decent actress  but didnt improve as much as i thought she would after species  
this is the typical van damme movie  with jeanclaude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents  
nothing new here  and certainly nothing we havent seen in every other van damme movie  
simply put  there is absolutely nothing new about this movie  
it has a retread plot  this isnt the first time jeanclaude has played twins  
he still cant act  
we all saw natashas breasts in species  although this is one repeat performance im not complaining about   
this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in  sub par
