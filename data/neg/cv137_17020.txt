the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and couldve been effective  
such is the case with urban legend  the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks  
the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends  
examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house  
the killer wears one of those l  l  bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up  so you cant see the face  
i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days  
anyhow  the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric  
its a very good setup that promises more chills to come  
unfortunately  the film never takes off from there  
the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus  
like most slasher flicks  this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac  or in this case an axe wielding maniac   
ive always wondered why these killers dont save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill  
after the fine first scene  the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying youthoughtitwasthekillerbutwasjust someoneelse scares  
these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music  
i guess sudden  sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days  
the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast  
the slasher appears  attacks  the victim is eviscerated  and the tedious cycle appears anew  
false scares should always be used in moderation  
someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just arent as scary as they used to be  
this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commitits not frightening  
remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in scream and scream   
this movie still adheres to them  
tons of illogical moments about  more than i really have the inclination to list  
and i dont mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense  
that type of illogical can be fun  
this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember  
the last  minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that youll be laughing more than youll be screaming  
actually  you wont be screaming at all  
at its best  the acting can barely be called  adequate  and the script couldve definitely used a rewrite or two  
the film still manages to have some strong points  
the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans  
there are some intentionally funny moments  
  these were exceeded by the unintentional ones   
the film is well made from a technical standpoint  
besides the first part  there is also another good scene  a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station  
if there had only been more sequences like this  that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music  urban legend mightve been worth your money
