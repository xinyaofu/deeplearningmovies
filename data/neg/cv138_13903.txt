my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell  im even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago  and ive been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer  however  i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times  and that it had ended up in the midaugust dumping ground  
then  in this final week before its official release  i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didnt even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy  incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder  if it werent for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine  lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty  and the performances are completely uninspired  
thats the main problem with the avengers  for all its hiphop flash and tidal waves  none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
its like a chore  a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces  clocking in at  minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular s television show  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ive never watched an episode  
i wasnt alive then  
i dont even watch television now  
im very sorry that i dont have this perspective  but  judging from the reviews ive already read  knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
i didnt know and love john steed and emma peel  and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  
based on what the film told me  i gather that steed  fiennes  is some kind of british super guy  somewhat like james bond   and that dr  peel  thurman  is just a really smart doctor  who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
they are to work together  under mothers orders  mother is played by jolly jim broadbent  while his coconspirator  father  is played by the equallytalented fiona shaw   
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  
his name is de wynter  connery   
he is a crazy scottish guy  
our heroes had better stop him  or else  
  
  
the weather will keep getting colder until they  have to go to hell to warm up   one of the films few funny lines   
along the way there is subplot after subplot  hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere  feel perfunctory  and ultimately make no sense  
for example  our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  
now  killer bugs dont really go with the weathercontrolling theme of the film  
the purpose of the bugs  other than to annihilate our heroes  is never established  
theyre never even directly connected to de wynter  theyre controlled by his crazy henchman  played by eddie izzard   
the special effects arent bad  but theyre loud  obnoxious  and intrusive  
like so many scenes in the film  it seems present only to keep your attention from waning  
and i guarantee you  it will wane  
i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didnt do any good to think  
the avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved couldnt tell us what happens  
there are several scenes in the preview that didnt make the final cut  
in addition  many of the sequences have irritating  grainy film quality  which makes it feel lowbudget  the last scene is particularly bad   
the scenes that dont feature action should be electric  thanks to our wonderful cast  
they arent  
the action scenes should be electric  because this is an action film  
they arent  either  
and what about this wasted cast  
oh  it makes me weep with disappointment  
were talking ralph fiennes here  one of the best actors working today  one of the best actors  ever   
i love the guy  
ive loved all his films  until this one  
he seems like he wants to understand the film  but hes as lost as we are  
and thurman  in all of her spectacular beauty and talent  cant manage to look at home here  
  i dont blame her completely  for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way  and it cant be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting   
connery  however  seems the most out of it  totally lacking any kind of focus  or interest  for that matter  
who is to blame  
is it the screenwriter  don macpherson  
perhaps  although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right  
is it the actors  
for gods sake  no  these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling  
i blame director jeremiah chechik  who shouldnt have been given the task to begin with  
his best film  benny  joon  is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be  but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor  
add to that a lack of experience in bigbudget action  and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory  
if the avengers has a saving grace  its the set design  
the sets  by stuart craig  are big  colorful  and often pleasing to look at  
i like the final setpiece  on de wynters island  even if none of it makes a bit of sense  
i admired the overhead view of the stairs  showing dr  peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere  
i also enjoyed michael kamens music score  particularly in the opening credits  
but this stuff is routine  good sets and music are nice  but theres a lot more that needs to be here  
inspiration  for instance  would have been really nice  
maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story  
or a sense of purpose  
most of all  though  i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles  
damn this movie for not giving them the chance
