if snake eyes were a dog  youd put it to sleep  
if it was a couch  youd put it out on the sidewalk  where it would sit for a week  
if it were your child  youd be reading military school catalogs  
if it were a ship  no  it wouldnt be the titanic  that would imply glamor and tragedy  it would be the exxon valdez  
  personal side note  i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip  
for whatever reason  my hotels cable system wasnt showing the astrosbraves game  which featured a randy johnsongreg maddux matchup  
this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free  so the invective  deserved as it is  should be seen in that perspective   
snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie  and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater  
snake eyes is not a good mystery movie  but i had some questions  wheres the manager  and how do i get a readmit pass  
if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rentacar  can i sue brian de palma  
is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cages oscar  
will someone please  im begging you  give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents  
and how  exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does  
the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer  
if youve seen the trailer without seeing the movie  consider yourself fortunate  
the trailer is a work of sheer genius  
it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie  the noteworthy steadicam work  the exuberance of cages performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman  the essential elements of the marginal plot  
the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross  
  is a best trailer category at the oscars that farfetched  after all   
but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie  
the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot  detective ricky santoro  cage  must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city payperview boxing match  
unfortunately  there are multiple problems afoot  
the trailer gives away much  too much of the story  
the shooter is killed instantly  so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy  
the films secret is hohum at best  and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is  
without an interesting plot  without interesting dialogue  and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story  snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level  
as much as i hated this movie  i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit  
de palma is maddeningly inconsistent  
he can  on his day  create amazingly welldone movies  the untouchables  carlitos way   
on offdays  he can be  well  just horrid  the bonfire of the vanities  raising cain   
snake eyes falls into the horrid category  but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their filmschool degreeofdifficulty value  
the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor  
there is a splitscreen chase scene that looks pretty good  and its followed by a gods eye view of a bank of hotel rooms thats imaginitively done  
this is whats called giving the devil his due  
but the technical skill doesnt even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie  
placing plot holes to one side for a moment  snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history  george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers   a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps  and perhaps the worst  most overly drawn out ending in years  
snake eyes is a criminal act  an evil waste of time and talent  
cage  sinise  and yes  even de palma deserve better  
the audience deserves better  but no refund  no readmit pass  no free popcorn coupon  can ever restore to us the time weve spent or wash the awful images from our mind  
however  we are left with one consolation  that we were warned by the movies title  because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps
