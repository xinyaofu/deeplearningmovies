  some houses are born bad   goes the hauntings tag line  to which i must add   some movies  too   
nothing short of hiring a new cast  a more literate screenwriter  and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jacksons meritorious novel  
the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy  and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects dont frighten so much as numb the audience into submissionthe film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout  boo   
fragile nell  taylor   bisexual theo  zetajones   and smiley luke  wilson  are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders  hosted by professor marrow  neeson   
marrows secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill houses bleak history  
hes not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew  nell especially  who has some ancestral connection to the manors previous inhabitants  
taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first bigbudget lead  
for starters  her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes  when were introduced to the mansion and all its funhouse trappings  
her character is supposed to be depressed  having tended to an unloving mother for too many years  but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame  alternately grouchy  mopey  wiggy and pathetic  and i kept wondering why the other characters didnt just ditch this bitch  
as for the obscenely photogenic zetajones  she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her  
unfortunately  shes saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer  
theos assessment of the house  
  i love it  
sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters   
who on earth would say that in place of  citizen kane meets the munsters   
  furthermore  would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description   
both actresses fare better than neeson  who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble  and for good reason   and his character is the most bland  
as luke puts it  dr  marrow pulls the old  academic bait and switch  on his subjects  but he breaks down and confesses to this the second hes accused  
later  he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell  its amusing to hear neeson shout  nell  repeatedly  given his starring role in the  jodie foster vehicle of the same name   
why was this nice  helpful  and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start  
the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti  
his sets are obsessively detailed  and even before the cgi kicks in  they seem alive  never quite still  
i do have one beef with this aspect of the production  the real life mansion used in exterior shots  nottinghamshires harlaxton manor  is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company  no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins  always finish up in locations that were established in act one  as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house  
eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting  and despite a powerhouse box office debut  i doubt it will recoup its costs  including marketing  domestically  
thank jan de bont for that  proving for the third time that speed was a fluke  in that it was actually enjoyable  de bont has served up another ride  sans thrill  
his images  welllit though they are  have an unmistakable been theredone that quality  in fact  whole sequences  not to mention the cloaked  airy ghoul who owns the climax  feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back  peter jacksons the frighteners  
i dont mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist  i mean to suggest that hes a hack  having found no new ways to give us chills
