in  twilight   a exalcoholic  excop  exhusband  exprivateeye  harry ross  paul newman   works for a pair of aging hollywood actors  catherine  susan sarandon  and jack ames  gene hackman   
jack is being blackmailed  and he asks harry to deliver the payoff

emmet walsh   
as more bodies begin to pile up  harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherines first husband twenty years earlier to find out whos willing to kill to keep that secret buried  
newman  sarandon  
hackman  
with an alist cast of oscar laureates like that   twilight  would seem very promising  
however  the script is tired and predictable  
it would serve well as a tvmovieoftheweek  possibly with some s detective hero reprising his role  
the appeal of the project for its stars and its director  robert benton  is nostalgia  
  twilight  wants very much to be a s film noir with alan ladd or dick powell  
all of the standard tropes are here  a hardboiled p  i  
among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets  a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero  shadowy figures shooting from doorways  dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn  cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation  
the script offers little originality  and coauthors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in  is a clich  in   
elmer bernsteins score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn notefornote from a vintage noir  
the lead actors try hardnone of the three has every made less than a full effort  even when burdened with a bad script  
they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning  and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters  
harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine  
jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harrys love for catherine  
catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention  but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefullymaintained veneer  
  twilight  wants to be characterdriven like  nobodys fool   also directed by benton  also starring newman  based on a novel by russo  was  but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with  
  twilight  also squanders a fine supporting cast  stockard channing  harrys friend on the police force   reese witherspoon  jack  catherines bratty kid   giancarlo esposito  the humorous sidekick   john spencer  harrys nemesis on the force   liev schreiber and margo martindale  the blackmailers   and james garner  a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble
