  gordy  is not a movie  it is a minutelong  sesame street  skit  and a very bad one at that  
this movie is so stupid and dumb that its depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light  and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie  
im sure children are the target audience of this movie  but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it  
it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy  voiced by garms   whose family has been taken away to  up north   which we know means death  
of course we can hear the animals talk to each other  and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible  
actually  its almost funny in a way  
the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears  a little girl named jinnie sue macallister  young  who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him  
jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it  
what is the point of this  
maybe she is one of the producers relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something  
we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce  roescher  who is sad because his divorced mother is dating  
he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue  but he accidentally falls in a pool  probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a  suit on  nah  didnt see that one coming    
starts to drown  and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him  
if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hanks grandfather  the original ceo  dies and leaves his fortune to hank    
and gordy  
of course there must be a villain  but even this villain  donadio as sipes  isnt that evil  
he never raises his voice or becomes angry  and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story  
its hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film  or if the filmmakers are just this untalented and stupid  
at times  gordy  is tolerable to watch  thus earning it one star and not the dreaded  z   
but its just so unbelievably boring  cliche  dumb  unfunny  corny  and just plain bad it may scare children  it certainly disturbed me
