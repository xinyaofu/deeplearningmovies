senseless  r  marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian  and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life  
alas  moments are simply that  moments  which are not enough to lift this fantasycomedy above its onejoke premise  
granted  that one joke is initially amusing  
when wayanss darryl witherspoon  an economics major at stratford university  hits some dire financial straits  he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses  
after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses  darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm  
at this point  the film sounds more like senseful than senseless  but through some turns of the plot  darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once  essentially leaving himyessenseless  
this sets up some showcase moments for wayanss gift for physical comedy  especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely  hilariously limp  
but these gags  and the gag behind the entire movie  quickly grows stale  
once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses  instead of exploring any new comic territory  director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness  
wayans approaches each goround with gusto  but by this point hes simply treading water for the rest of the films unfunny duration  
senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didnt strive to be anything more than a comic trifle  
however  the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity  
darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cashstrapped family  and this  serious  angle seems to come from an entirely different movie  
unlike wayanss last starring vehicle  the surprisingly effective  and serious  the th man  the  emotional  content of senseless is forced and unconvincing  
any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzlesdarryls romance with janice  tamara taylor   a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself  does not generate sparks of any kind  
once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros  comes to an end  the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising bigscreen future ahead of him  
but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless  his film career could go the way of his oncepromising older brother  damon  who is now set to make his comebackon television
