  desperate measures  is a generic title for a film thats beyond generic  
its also a depressing waste of talent  with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles  not to mention oncecool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of notcool flicks  this thriller is more  before and after  than  reversal of fortune   
the movie is a big disappointment  and yet its somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it  the premise is both promising and intriguing  
too bad the executions all wrong  though  because the setup of  desperate measures  boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use  
san francisco cop frank connor  garcia  is a single parent with a troubling dilemma  his son matt  joseph cross  is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission  
even worse  the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe  michael keaton   currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society  
connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery  hes at first reluctant  but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital  
when he does make a run for it  connor offers close pursuit  but for different reasons than his superiors  including the crusty brian cox   they want to take mccabe down  while connor needs to keep him alive  or all hope is lost for his little boy  
one misstep  desperate measures  makes is in its underdevelopment of matts illness  
whats needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works  there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country  and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow  
take  for example  a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital  
the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him  and what does connor do  
he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight  
connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of  and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son  
whatever  
to be fair  though  the lack of story background is the least of the movies problems  
first and foremost is how cheaply  desperate measures  trades the potential of its opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour  
once mccabe escapes  the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills  
there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away  
also  the movie is so intent on giving you a hootinducing  lipsmacking villain  the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter  natch  that it completely casts garcias frank connor by the dullsville wayside   desperate measures  appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist  and the movies headscratcher of a sendoff confirms this  
there is some good to be found amongst this mess  particularly in the acting department  
cast against type  michael keatons understated menace is highly effective  
although hes not given much believable to work with  andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord  
joseph cross  as garicias ailing son  is surprisingly unsentimental  and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos  
this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending  but most is lost  
it goes without saying that  desperate measures  needs an operation of its very own
