robin williams is a comedic genus  
that is  he is one when hes in a film that allows him space to move  
  flubber  straps him in a straitjacket  covers him with duct tape  stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesnt get out  
in a remake of its own   absent minded professor   disney offers us proof that more is definitely less  
recycling old films   that darned cat     dalmatians   dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared  
professor phillip brainard  williams  is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college  
his fiancee  sara jean reynolds  marcia gay harden   president of the college is none too happy with him because hes left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of shortterm  and longterm  memory  
shes giving him one more chance  
he blows that chance when he invents  flubber   flying rubber  and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress  
his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself  
its not all bad news  
flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it  
brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the towns evil industrialist charles hoenicker  raymond barry   
while hes busy with his new breakthrough  the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft  christopher mcdonald   
theres a flying car  flubberenhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment  none of which are the least bit interesting or funny  
at one point  my son looked around the audience and asked  why are these people laughing   
although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles  he is easily the most lively of the actors  
everyone else comes across as halfasleep  
the remake is successful in that respect  
it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties  
i remember the original as being charming  but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years  
there have been some updates  
fred macmurrays flying model t has been replaced by a tbird  
his faithful dog charlie is now  weebo   the hovering robot  
the biggest change is that  with sophisticated computer animation  we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining  
flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality  
the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number  
this has nothing to do with the story  
the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys  
not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem  
there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do dont make sense  
the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford  
anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions  
its unbelievable that his lover  well  probably not a lover  after all this is disney  starts dating croft after the aborted wedding  
theres not one appealing component of this man  
after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc  i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball  
this guy is beyond forgetful  venturing into the certifiable  
cowriter john hughes used to direct lightweight but thoughtful teen films  
the care behind  pretty in pink  and  the breakfast club  all went out the window after his  home alone  franchise heated up the box offices  
looking much like  home alone      flubber  even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot  
in some ways  its difficult to judge this film  
i have a suspicion that im not its target audience  
after all  i measure my age in two digits
