so  its thirty years later  and oscar and felix are together again  
that might have been an exciting notion if it wasnt for the fact that the  odd couple  of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies  s  grumpy old men   s  grumpier old men   and s  out to sea   i  e  
  grumpiest old men    
so   the odd couple ii   i  e  
  the grumpiest old men of all  really   seems just another entry in a tired series  
the plot is even similar to that of  grumpy old men  in that lemmon and matthaus mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children  
oscars son  jonathan silverman  and felixs daughter  lisa waltz  are getting married  and former roommates felix ungar  lemmon  and oscar madison  matthau  meet at the airport and decide to share a car  
  
  
then hilarity ensues  
well  a few chuckles ensue anyway  
neil simon  the awardwinning playwright who created oscar and felix  provides the screenplay  which is a shock  because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end  
unlike the original playmovie   odd couple ii  doesnt find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters  
instead  it depends upon a series of humorous situations  oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff  are caught smuggling mexicans over the border  take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands  the women are played by christine baranski of  cybill  and jean smart of  designing women    and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert  
the original  movie  the odd couple  remains a classic comedy  
it introduced the motif of roommateasspouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since  
it was the second outing for the lemmonmatthau team  which debuted in s  the fortune cookie    and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies   the front page     and  buddy buddy      before going their separate ways  
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in  grumpy old men  six years ago was delightful  and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie  
but  out to sea  and  the odd couple ii  are just beating a grumpy old horse  
  you can add lemmons  my fellow americans   i  e  
  grumpy old presidents   to that list  too   
lets hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do  
lets hope also that we see neil simons name on movies that do it justice  this is his first since s  lost in yonkers
