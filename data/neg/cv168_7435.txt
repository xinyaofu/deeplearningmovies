except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy  that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through  
bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan  actress and author  once married  now violently divorced  and back together one last time for their daughter mollys  paula marshall  wedding  
lilly and dan hate each other passionately  so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again  
each ditches his or her current spouse of  years and runs off with the other  
molly  married now only  hours  runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith  jamie denton  tries to console the abandoned spouses  
in mollys search for her parents  she somehow falls in love with lillys paparazzo joey  danny nucci   
meanwhile  the newlywed keith ends up consoling dans wife rowena  gail ogrady  in bed  
the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious  
im no dan quayle  but i thought it was a bit creepy  
the message seemed to be  ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish   
  family values  aside  theres something cruel about all this  
perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy  but the movie is a romantic comedy  
we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps  
reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable  
lillys husband is a newage flake who rambles about  emotional valet parking   so we can write him off as irrelevant  
dans wife is vain  manipulative  and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch  
mollys husband is a careerconscious  selfcentered republican politician who thinks shes too fat  and just for good measure  he also fucked dans wife   so we can write him off as a prick  
everyone else falls in love  
but still  that somehow doesnt justify the actions of the movies main characters  
  hes a prick  or  shes a bitch  is no defense  
the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog  often during heated arguments  and by aboveaverage performances by midler and farina  breaking out of his characteractor mold   
other than that  its a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick
