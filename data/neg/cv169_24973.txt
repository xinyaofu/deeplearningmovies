maybe this mission should have been scrubbed 
mission to mars 
a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman 
theres a world of difference between artists and technicians  
the artist has a vision to create something new  
he may not do it well  it might be sloppy  but its something youve never seen before  
a good technician can make it look good  but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else  its going to be just a xerox  
obviously successful films need both skills  
brian de palma is a masterful technician  
hes spent his career copying others  most notably hitchcock  
he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work  but only because he has learned it by rote  
aside from rare flashes of originality  his films are often souldead  
in de palmas latest  he turns his attention to stanley kubrick  
to tell the truth  i enjoyed portions of this movie  but i liked it a lot better over  years ago when it was called     
i enjoyed it even more when it was titled  close encounters   
nasa has set its sights for mars  
when the first crew meets with disaster  a rescue mission is sent to the red planet  
they dont do so well either  but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronautgonerasta and solve the mysteries of the universe  
and its all so boring  
there are so many scenes that just dont work  its difficult to begin  
when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upsidedown martian tornado  which looks remarkably like a sandworm from  dune   destroying everything in its path  they just hang out watching  
error  
the most interesting character  and thats not saying much  is killed off  
error  
the alien is laughable  
error  
the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable  
error  
theres some nice eyecandy  
the face on mars  which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head  looks cool  
a threedimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world  
maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic  
but theres so much more that feels as if weve been there before  
from     theres the rotating space station  the blinding white room  
from  close encounters   they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens  
the list goes on  
the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues  
even gary sinise and tim robbins cant muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing  
no one seems to care about anything that happens  
you wont either  
the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr  pepper  with a  foot tall logo  saves the day  
they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film
