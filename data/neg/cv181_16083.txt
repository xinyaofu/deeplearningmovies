as with any genx mtv movie  like last years dead man on campus   the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points  sex and football  
those two items  wrapped in a guiltypleasure package  are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially  but sales will decline for two reasons  
first  the football sequences are nothing new  nor can they be  the sports genre isnt mainstream and its been retread to death  
second  the sex is just bad  
despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the allnight stripclub party  theres nothing even remotely tantalizing  
the acting is mostly mediocre  not including the fantastic jon voight  
cultivating his usual sliminess  voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer  
kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes twentytwo conference championships and two state titles in thirty years  this year he plans to make it twentythree  
unfortunately  when his star quarterback  lance harbor  paul walker   goes down for the count  hes got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon  james van der beek   
moxon leads the team through its last four games  and then must cope with his newfound stardom  the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie  amy smart   and other temptations that abound in footballcrazy west canaan  
most regions of the country are not nearly as footballcrazy as texas  and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most  
similarly  the set design is wrong for a high school setting  the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms  radio headsets  which never seem to work  however  and instead require coaches to signal plays manually   and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer  
these elements  as well as the heavy drinking and carousing  might be more appropriate on a college campus  but mtvs core audience is the high school demographic  
this focus is further emphasized by the casting  james van der beek  of tvs  dawsons creek   is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero  although he never manages to do anything with the role  
other stars are similarly young and unmemorable  
theres not much that goes right about varsity blues  and theres not much to like about it  either  
everything herein has already been done  and if it hasnt  the movie manages to botch it one way or another  
this is certainly missable
