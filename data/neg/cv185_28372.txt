  the animal  is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along  generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling  
its clunky and slow  like watching an wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill  
there are certainly better things you can do with your time  
actually  if youve seen the trailer  then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments  
the story centers on bland marvin  rob schneider   who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer  
but hes afflicted with loseritis  
dogs attack him  neighbors torment him  children bully him  and his coworkers ignore him  
truthfully  with his bad haircut  seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic  little richard  and giant poodles  and his unenthusiastic demeanor  wed probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun  
this is actually bad because you cant like a character if you cant develop sympathy for him  
we never do  and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor  
however  marvin is found by an eccentric doctor  michael caton  who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him  implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs  
as a result  marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed  
he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body  swim with the speed of a dolphin  and can run as fast as a cheetah  
imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation  
with his enhanced abilities  he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him  
however  the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn  and instead  marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic  sexual urges  
goats beware  
he also chases cats  urinates to mark his territory  or growls at his enemies  
what he shouldve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich  
equally tenuous is its other running joke  which involves one of his friends  guy torry  who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because hes black  
  its reverse racism   he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything  
this element doesnt work the first time its mentioned  and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence  
you dont have to be as wise as an owl to realize that  the animal  is tame  
if theres any reason to see this film  its to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut  
remember her  
she was voted off in week  of the week program   survivor   
here  she plays marvins sunny love interest  
while her role required very little actual acting  she seemed very comfortable  even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog    yuck    
with her adorable disposition  radiant smile  and playful innocence  she could be a meg ryan in the making  
its too bad that shes in such a mediocre offering
