 is dull  perfunctory  uninspired  and boring  
a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives  flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors  
i  however  would rather cut to the chase  
 is dull  perfunctory  uninspired  and boring  
there is nothing in it  not a glimpse of depth  nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight  
there is no electricity in any of the scenes  or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots  
and its underdeveloped  and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think theyre in this years boogie nights  
they are so wrong  
the picture has been assembled by mark christopher  
based on this film  i dont know how he got a job in the business  
 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name  which originated in the s and closed down in the s  
i dont know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released  but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas andersons brilliant work in every possible way  from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography  
what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great  depth  intelligence  energy  fascinating characters  and challenging themes  
 cant even measure up to the last days of disco  which is flawed  but still smart and entertaining  
its remarkably bad timing  id say  to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  
i have exaggerated  though  there is one interesting character  and one terrific performance  
that character is steve rubell  played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves  
steve rubell is the owner of studio   and if christopher had focused on him  then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself  
alas  we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane  ryan phillippe   a goingnowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club  thanks to rubells homosexual impulses  
its here that he meets his friends  the array of uninteresting characters  his coworker  greg  brecklin meyer   his wife  anita  salma hayek   and  of course  the love interest  julie black  neve campbell   
shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning  and he has a reasonably sturdy home life  
  some of the scenes with his father border on interesting  while heather matarazzo  who plays his sister  pushes phillippe off the screen   
but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene  and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs  
why his  friends  push him into drugs is never really explained  but the fact that they are  friends  is questioned only is superficial ways  greg gets really mad at shane because hes been elevated to bartender status   
there isnt a single conflict that takes center stage  except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works  
most of the film is dumb  and most of the dialogue is inane  
theres a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black  and  in the next scene  theyre arminarm without a bit of development  
then  theyre kissing in a bowling alley  
this is five minutes of material  thrown into the picture at the last minute  well past the onehour mark  and this isnt a long film to begin with   
campbell is a talented actress  but she needs a role that gives her a little depth  
this one doesnt  
and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever  this performance pales in comparison to mark whalbergs starmaking role in boogie nights  
he seems dumb and misguided  and his voice never changes tone  
i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body  but he seems pretty lanky to me  
hes all wrong for a lead role  but it doesnt help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters  
by the end of   shanes most notable trait is his stupid  fake accent  
the rest of the performances are wasted  
hayek is an energetic  talented young actress  and does almost nothing here  
meyer is endearing  but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard  
only myers  by sheer force of talent  manages to rise above christophers wadingpool of a script  
rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters  but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance  
in fact  myers is the sole reason to see   and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him  
ive read that studio  has been recreated down to the last detail  
frankly  i dont care  
its easy to recreate something technical like this  
a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task  
besides  christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible  anyway  
aside from myers performance   is a complete failure  
its dull  perfunctory  uninspired  and boring  
some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair  but theyre so obvious to me  
in any event   is pallid without the contrast  
it doesnt even work as mindless entertainment  its so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it  
so  dont forget those key words  dull  perfunctory  uninspired  and boring  
everything else i said was just padding
