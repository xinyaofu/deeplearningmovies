  houston  we have a serious problem   
after making  mission  impossible   brian de palma has a lot to live up to  
by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew  he hopes to reach the modern audience  
and the possibilities are certainly there  but the result is a great disaster  
starting in a near future  with a prologue copied from  apollo    de palma slowly builds up his  story   
the human race has already set foot on mars  
a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened  
this is basically the whole plot  
so its hard to imagine that it can be stretched to  hours  
but de palma manages to do that  
it is not a very good achievement  
as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space  the hardest thing to do is stay awake  
the films major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is  
david mamets dialogue  while trying to seem natural  is distant and simply fake  
de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot  
the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubricks    a space odyssey    apollo   and  godzilla   
to make time pass  the creators have inserted several  refreshing  scientific details  that would not convince a halfcrazed frog  
it consists of multiple copies and direct rippoffs from several great science fiction films and stories  
when it finally presents an almost original idea  it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity  
i cant even call this film predictable  since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this  
sometimes it gets so cheesy  that youll start laughing when youre supposed to cry and cry when youre supposed to laugh  
youll see enormous sandstorms  hear mysterious sounds and  last but not least  on this  constantly surprising  tour youll see  an alien  
its really hard to find comparisons to such an experience  and i know that ive never said that before  i thought i never would   but  lost in space  is actually better  
thats an achievement in itself  
director brian de palma has stroke gold with  untouchables  that became an instant american classic  
it is for this film that he will be remembered  while all his other failures will be forgotten  
hell live to fight another day  
i send the actors my condolences  since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters  
and both the cinematography  production design and art direction are very decent  
it is because of the achievement of  people  that i rate this film   
unfortunately their hard work was in vain  
if you have problems with insomnia  i recommend you this film  
if youre not asleep within the first half hour  consult your doctor
