one of the first films of  is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek  the star of the wbs runaway hit dawsons creek  
following in the foot steps of mtvs two other live action films  joes apartment    and dead man on campus     varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace  
set in west cannan  texas  the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john  mox  moxon  van der beek   
we know hes smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook  
coach bud kilmer  jon voight  has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him  
the star quarterback  lance harbor  paul walker   is a handsome  blonde  hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader  darcy  ali larter   
also on the team are an enormous guy  ron lester  with some health problems and the token africanamerican team member  eliel swinton  whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin  
when lance is seriously injured  mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it  undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies  
his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend  jules  amy smart   is threatened and theres a big game at the end  
guess who wins  
nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love  
theres a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow  
van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes  
also  the role isnt very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character  
hes still a pseudointellectual  whiny  nice guy  except here he also happens to be a jock  
voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out  
the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers dont fare much better  
on the positive side  walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville     
scott  son of james  caan has some lively moments as tweeder  the teams wild man  
larter  as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas  gets to show off the films most interesting costumes  including a very eyeopening  whipped cream bikini   
its interesting to note that the film definitely earns its rrating with a lot of harsh language  alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity  including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise   
all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawsons creek  presumably the target audience for the picture  
director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger  from nickelodeon films  a sister company of mtv  and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression  
the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it  
the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out  
theres an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul  foo fighters  green day and aaliyah but its not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film
