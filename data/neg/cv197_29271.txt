susan grangers review of  jeepers creepers   mgmua entertainment  
this nasty  little horror film begins as a bickering brother  justin long  and sister  gina philips  are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrappedup bodies down a drainage pipe  
when long decides to investigate  theres nothing but trouble  
  you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it  
 well  this is it   
philips warns  
what he finds in the basement of an old  abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying  jaggedstitched incision from his neck to his navel  plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies  stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry  
long flees but now the monstrous  winged creeper  jonathan breck  is after both of them  
eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle  a psychic who explains the evil creatures bizarre feeding habits  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    jeepers creepers  is a fiendishly visceral  with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion  giving new meaning to the old song  jeepers creepers   
and now  as paul harvey would say  for the rest of the story  
whats more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writerdirector victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a  yearold actor in california  
sentenced to three years in prison  he served  months and completed parole in   
when salva made  powder      the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities  disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile  
and now  once again  in this mgmua film  that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio
