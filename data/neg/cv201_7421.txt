i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part   
the best way i can put it is that its funky  
i know this is an odd question  but remember the opening music of  police academy   citizens on patrol   when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song  citizens on patrol  during the opening credits  
its just like that  
anyway  part  takes place a day after the events of part   so technically still    
this time  a group of horny teens  who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason  head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed  
it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life  which must have been between parts  and   so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me  
shes the lone survivor this time  
part  was originally shown in theaters in d  and from what i can tell from the video  it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects  
jason had long  wild hair when he was unmasked in part   now  one day later hes completely bald  
also  it being one day later  it cant be friday the th now can it  
oh well  
steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series
