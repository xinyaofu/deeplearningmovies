the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images  
the tinkling christmas tree bell in  its a wonderful life   
bogies speech at the airport in  casablanca   
little elliotts flying bicycle  silhouetted by the moon in  e  t   
and now   starship troopers  director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever  doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug  
  starship troopers   loosely based on the robert heinlein novel  is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects  
in the hands of verhoeven  the mammoth scifi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made  a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale  
to put it simply  its a bug bomb  
in  robocop  and  total recall   verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence  special effects and social satire  and  starship troopers  starts off in similar fashion  with a tongueincheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise  
things go downhill fast  though  as we meet our heroes  a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school  
inexplicably  johnny rico  carmen ibenez  dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by squarejawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial  
its a veritable  alpha centuri   as we watch the lovesmitten teens squabble in the name of love  
michael ironside plays their teacher  who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities  
eventually  the kids join the military  with dreams of glory in their addled little minds  
one of their classmates  carl jenkins   doogie housers  neil patrick harris   snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities  
he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mothers leg  
a long  dull boot camp sequence follows  enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the  showgirls  directors camera roams over their buff bodies  
finally  a full hour into the film  the war finally starts and we meet the enemy  
the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space  
they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears  
yes  incredible as it seems  the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts  
a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best  
sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary  but the closeups are a different matter  
the insects have an odd  artificial look  like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating  
the attack scenes are intensely violent  as one would expect from verhoeven  but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension  
while the action is frantic  the military strategy  wildly illogical even by hollywood standards  grows tiresome quickly  
verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage  but the fauxjingoistic scenes of children  doing their part for the war effort  by squishing roaches on a sidewalk arent enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck  
one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here  
his customary one part satire  two parts ultraviolence formula is way out of whack  and most of the film just flounders  
in  showgirls  fashion  some scenes are almost bad enough to be good  
an intergalactic kegger party  with jake busey playing  dixie  on a green plexiglas fiddle  has a certain bizarre appeal  
a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm  enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug  but tells her hero that she doesnt mind dying  
  its okay   she gasps   i got to have you   
and then  of course  theres doogies mind meld with a bug  
its possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel  
heinleins pre  stranger in a strange land  books were aimed at adolescent males  and  starship troopers  has the antiseptic retrofuture look of late searly s scifi  
the one cityscape shown is a jetsonslike gleaming metropolis  with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting  
the hairstyles are retro too  straight from the frankie avalon  annette funicello school of fashion  
ultimately  verhoevens motives are irrelevant  
he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire  
it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie  
avoid  starship troopers  at all costs
