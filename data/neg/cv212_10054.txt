capsule  not as bad a sequel as crow  or batman  robin  but still horribly putrid  cheesy and illconceived  
this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons    
extended review  you know  about halfway through this movie  i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes  youd have a damn fine  minutes or so of flashy  hong kong style martial arts  
beautifully choreographed by robin shou  who also plays liu kang  the fight scenes are both mindblowing and graceful  acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep  
this is what made the original so fun  but unfortunately for the sequel  we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson  
instead  they got john r  leonetti  the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat  
not a good choice  
while the fight scenes are brutal and eyepopping  the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare  
the acting is subpar  which i could endure if it were not for a   the directors style  b   the special effects   c   the treatment of the story and characters  
a   mr  leonetti should go back to lighting  in my opinion  
i could say dozens of bad things about him  he way overuses slowmotion  he has no eye for action  he cant get even mediocre performances out of actors  and so on  
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping  
apparantly  everybody can now fly  
hell  im all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot  but not when it happens every few minutes  and is done so poorly  
better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena  warrior princess  
in short  they should have gotten paul anderson back  
or at least let robin shou direct    
b   unlike the first one  whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic  mk  as special effects are bland  fake looking  and overall just plain bad  
i counted at least half a dozen times that bluescreening was painfully obvious  
had this movie been made in the s  it would have been groundbreaking  
but in todays industry  it doesnt even look finished  
c   now for the really bad parts  
i admit  im an avid fan of the mortal kombat series  
the games are amusing diversions  an easy way to work off stress and anger  
the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride  
this could have been a really cool movie  
it isnt  
the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers  
some of the plot elements are just plain stupid  
how stupid  
take  for instance  how our heroes move around  
they use giants spheres the roll around underground  supposedly at thousands of miles per hour    oh 
boy    
even worse is the treatment of secondary characters  
blink and youll miss em  
most characters had more depth in the video games  
if you thought batman  robin was bad about this  you aint seen nothin yet  
a good  of the characters are introduced  kick somebody around a bit  then either die or are forgotten about  
theres no explanation at all for this  
and for the final blasphemy  the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for  the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie  lasted about  minutes and then just sort of    ended  
it almost made me weep  
to sum it all up  rent it on video  and fastforward through everything except the fight scenes
