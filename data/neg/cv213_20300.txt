in  the astronauts wife   charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor  pixiehairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly  
if only her name wasnt jillian  the makers of this embarrassing bit of scifi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title   rosemarys species   
what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron  oscarworthy in  the devils advocate   struggle with the lamest ripoff of a screendom classic in recent memory  
ok  maybe  the astronauts wife  deviates from  rosemarys baby  turf for its setup  which finds our heroine terrorized not by satans minions but her possessed husband  johnny depp   a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him  um  a changed man  
predictably  he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant  his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great  bowfinger  line about  alien love   
therons  advocate  character faced a similar dilemma  the horror there resonating strongly  
  astronaut  provides only artificial anxiety  
last years equally noodleheaded  species ii  spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth  but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage  
  the astronauts wife  is grave and humorfree  passing its increasingly silly story off as fullfledged serious  right down to an ambiguous finale that isnt even going to satisfy those whove stayed with it thus far  
heres a hint  it involves lots of water  electrical equipment  a special effect from  the abyss  and the tots who doubled up as adam sandlers costar in  big daddy   
draw your own conclusions  
directorwriter rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary  e  t   
cinematographer allen daviau  but too often favors the films visual presentation over the story hes trying to tell  
this bodes horribly for each dramatic development  like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official   speed  s joe morton  to instigate jills slow and stupid comprehension of the truth  
his hypererratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge  
instead  he adds to the phoniness  
theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall  she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation  cider house rules   he in the lead of tim burtons eagerlyawaited  sleepy hollow   
undeserving of such talent   the astronauts wife  manages to be derivative  dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs  
in space  no one can hear you scream  
but in a movie theatre  everyone can hear you snore
