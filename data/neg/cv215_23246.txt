libby parsons  ashley judd  has the perfect little life  a rich husband  a cute son  and a house on the ocean  but when her husband nick  bruce greenwood  takes her sailing  she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood  
just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there  the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent  
shes convicted of his murder  of course  and leaves her son matty  benjamin weir  with her best friend  annabeth gish   
time passes  and the friend disappears with matty  
during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell  daddy   
and realizes that her husband is still alive  
libby serves six years  growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick  based on the theory that because of the  double jeopardy  amendment she can off him with impunity   
when she gets parole  shes sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman  tommy lee jones   a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident  
after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property  libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty  
travis pursues  naturally  
  double jeopardy  is a watereddown version of  the fugitive   with jones sleepwalking through his wellworn pursuer persona  
although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train  she manages to get into a few nailbiters  chased down the beach by a jeep  chained to a car that plunges into the ocean  sealed in a coffin  that add some much needed thrills to an anemic  slowmoving script  
character development is thin  
travis intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story  
  i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the doublejeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick  
its a long way to go for one line   
theres considerable sexual tension between travis and libby  hey  theres something  the fugitive  didnt have    but it never goes anywhere  
libby is a tvmovie everywoman  but judds intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics  
this is judds most prominent role to date  and she proves that she can light up the screen  
lets hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around  
the quality of director bruce beresfords movies seems to depend on luck  
when he has a good script and a strong cast  he turns out oscarcaliber work like  breaker morant    driving miss daisy   and  tender mercies   
when he doesnt  
  
  
we get  double jeopardy   
screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on  the rock   a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites  
bottom line  ashley judd tries hard but cant save this predictable bore
