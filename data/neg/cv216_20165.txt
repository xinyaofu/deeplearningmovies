as far as  mystery men  is concerned  the burning question is less  is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer   
  the answer there is an unequivocal  yes   and more  how in the name of sweet jesus did firsttime director kinka usher get such a firstrate cast to act in this muck   
  mystery men  features greg kinnear as the heavilysponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis  singular  casanova frankenstein  
a veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title  who join forces to get c  amazing out of a tight spot when c  frankenstein puts the screws on champion city  
theres william h  macy as the mildmannered shoveler  hank azaria as the cutleryflinging blue raja  no knives  but a phony english accent thats just as sharp   ben stiller as mr  furious  whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar   janeane garofalo as a crazed bowler with her fathers skull interestingly preserved  wes studi as a rhetoricspouting cowled avenger  and kel mitchell as the token  and  adding insult to injury  invisible   
black guy  
bringing up the rear  so to speak  is paul reubens  yes  thats pee wee herman paul reubens  as    
well  lets just call him the gas man  
the production design is overblown  the special effects are overdone  and the script  based on bob burdens  dark horse  comic book series  is overbaked  
the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar  but they cant begin to save  mystery men  its just one big mess  
youre better off renting the video and pressing fastforward to get to the funny bits  
i believe i counted three
