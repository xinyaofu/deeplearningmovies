  american pie  alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summers attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute coupleness and zany comedy  
its about an a student  biggs as  paul   who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora  suvari  a ditzy heroinchic goth chick who has no ambition or selfrespect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like  hickboy  paul is  
so weve got a fishoutwater formula mixed with meetcute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie  
unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by  clueless  auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film  
these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable  its as if everyone under age  is a stoned raver  
theres no background or details to anyone or anything  its just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other  
not to mention the story itself which is virtually nonexistant and contains so many plotholes its like swiss cheese  
even the basic editing is bad  
if youre looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny  
i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all  
if youve seen the commericials youve seen all the  funny  parts  which are all from the first five minutes
