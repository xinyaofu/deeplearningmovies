last summer  a featurelength version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning  
based on the famous s television show  the film was an enormous boxoffice flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros  a year later  the studio is up to their old tricks again  with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild  wild west  
but it sounded promising  the same tagteam of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld  who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success  is at the reins again  
and costar kevin kline is attached to the project  as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects  
i mean  what could possibly go wrong  
the answer is just about everything  
wild wild west is a cinematic abomination  a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate  
there are a lot of fancy special effects  and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression  
but the script is so deliriously uneven  the entire movie so off course  that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it  
at square one  we have a bizarre case of casting  
will smith plays james west  a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series  
my guess regarding the casting of africanamerican smith is a simple one  the actor  a cozy summertime release  big bucks for all those involved  
smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material  but this is not an ideal role for him  
hes too much of a joker  
i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role  and frankly  that sounds a lot more plausible  
what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such selfassurance in his eyes  you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office  
the plot involves west and crossdressing government agent artemus gordon  kevin kline   who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists  
the trail leads to the diabolical dr  arliss loveless  kenneth branagh   a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry  witty southern accent  
loveless has taken the countrys top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control  using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns  
one such weapon is an foot mechanical tarantula  bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right  
the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular  seamlessly blending computergenerated imagery with the western surroundings  
unfortunately  all of these effects seem so detached from the story  and can do little to support the films plot deficiencies  which are undoubtedly the main problem  
wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works  
most of the jokes  usually care of smith  die on arrival  
if its one thing that could possibly be the saving grace  its the performances  and even they are mostly offkilter and poorly delivered  
kline is admirable  but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot  
salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest  because she is viewed as little more than that  window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon  
branagh  an esteemed shakespearean actor and director  adds marginal enjoyment to the film  
but even he is so utterly weird and overthetop  
rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is  
i suppose theres always one turkey of the summer season  a highly anticipated  bigbudget release that manages to completely disappoint  
wild wild west is such a movie  and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of   
but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office  
perhaps after this  audiences will be less assured when they see will smiths name stamped on a summer movie  
after such hits as independence day and mib  wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume
