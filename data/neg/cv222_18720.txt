synopsis  an aging master art thief  his supplier  and a young  buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be  or are they   in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium  
comments  this movie was boring  
plain and simple  
entrapment should not have been boring  
it stars sean connery  who can still carry an action film despite his age  catherine zetajones  a likeable enough film presence  and ving rhames  ultracool star of pulp fiction and mission  impossible  
it takes full advantage of the yk computer bug fears  a current  hot topic  in the news  in its storyline  which is set at the end of   
it has some genuinely wellstaged action sequences  
so  what went wrong  
plenty  unfortunately  
the major problem with entrapment is its script  
it has a beenthere  donethat feel to it  
nothing seems particularly inventive or original  so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags  it runs nearly two hours   
the screenwriters  for example  periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes  i  e  
   days to the millennium    
this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked scifi film strange days  
the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning  which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth  surprise  revelation is made  
entrapment  in other words  relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each characters true motive is  resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion  
the star power here is quite strong  but the viewer cant help but feel the actors are wasted in this production  
sean connery is given such mindnumbing lines as  never trust a naked woman   
ving rhames character seems like an afterthought  hes not developed at all  
the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zetajoness tight wardrobe  
this  in and of itself  is not bad  but  after a while  it has a juvenile feel to it  
at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that theyre exploiting the female body  
entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development  sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her  in tights  arc and pivot around laser beams   
the tagline for this movie reads  the trap is set   
it sure is  on those who spent money to see this movie  
entrapment really isnt that bad  it is watchable  
i would suggest  however  one waits until this is on cable or television to see it
