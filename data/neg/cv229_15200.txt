its amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest standup around but completely fall flat in the movies  
take adam sandler  
on the basis of his first two cds   theyre all gonna laugh at you   
and  what the hell happened to me     
hes the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams  
but when you put him in front of a camera  it just isnt the same  
i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation  but his latest film  the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal  
seriously  im willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here  
in fact  i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic  
the first half hour generated not one smile in me  with its scenes of emotional abuse towards adams character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players  but also by his very disturbed mother  kathy bates  what is the world coming to    
granted  after the film gets rolling  there are a few mild chuckles throughout  im even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice   but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for its nearly hour and a half running time  
youre all familiar with the plot because youve seen it at least a million times before  everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions  in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves  
and believe me  im not giving anything away by saying that sandlers team wins  
if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie  then god be with you  
the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobbys love interest  
i mean  they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose  but they do extremely well with what they are given here  
kudos to both of them  
my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin  who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen  
rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh  
or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have  like jim carrey did with the recent truman show  
with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses  he just cant keep going on like this
