according to popular film opinion  a films greatness is determined by time  
take for example  casablanca   
great film  even today  
its still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic  
another example would be  star wars   which had a very  very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about  billion times before  
but as i rewatched  independence day  when it came out on video after being the number one hit of   i kinda felt like it wasnt as cool as when i had first seen it  
i had liked it when i saw it the first time     was my original view  and basically saw it as a good  escape film   
but when i rewatched it  i felt cheated  
thus  the curse of the  event film   
  independence day  is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once  except for a couple kids  the critics  in this situation   
but after a while  this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  
well  this kid is the  event film  in my little analogy  
and when i rewatched  independence day   not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen  but i felt insulted the whole time  
there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just arent sure if its comedy or hokey drama  
one scene  youll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch  the next youll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around  saying corny lines  
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of  glen or glenda   
now this annoying kids problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once  he shows he has no balls  
and  independence day  has no balls  
it plays it safe everywhere  
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films  
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of  star wars   
i mean  isnt that devils den  
and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moores breasts in  striptease   
theyre these octopus men  boring freaking octopus men  
i mean  come on  
the aliens in    were more interesting and you didnt even see them  
basically the plot is straight from a bmovie from the s  aliens come to earth and we wonder if theyre hostile or peaceful  
okay  its an interesting topic  but its not handled greatly  
now they arent and somehow a computer geek  jeff goldblum  figure out theyre using our satellites as a countdown to destruction  
yep  
these aliens are not only heavily armed  theyre stupid too  
they also use the same kind of computer as we do  but that comes about later  
the president  bill pullman   whos under attack for being a wimp  decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent  and he decides hell stay in the white house which the aliens have covered  
i dont care if its bob freaking dole in the white house  get him out of there  
i dont care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol  just get him out of there  
later on  hes stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship  
i think its time for impeachment for this guy  
hes more senile than reagan on pot  
then theres a cocky pilot  will smith  who is the only person to survive the counterattack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area   the films only sign of being brave   
his girlfriends a stripper sharing a subplot with  striptease  in that she has to do it for her son  
come on  she has a fighter pilot boyfriendsoontobe fiance  
i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers  
shes also the few  the proud  the lucky to survive the igniting of l  a   as well as her dog  who narrowly survives   
there are some bright spots  
they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing  
the best one is when jeff goldblum  nicely named david  turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says   good morning  dave   
and they even played r  e  m  s 
  its the end of the world as we know it  and i feel fine  at the beginning  
and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great  hes a stereotype  but i just loved the man anyway   
but there are no real subtle comic moments  
will gets way too many oneliners and he has no one to play off of  execept jeff towards the end  and the two do great   
as i said  this film has no balls  
it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and thats what it is  
but after a couple months  we all move on to the next  event  film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure  
but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime  
this ones short on batteries
