by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer  its possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one  
action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup  
audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the films sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending  which is an insulting copout  
somewhere out there  maybe theres a small cadre of filmgoers who will appreciate spheres dubious charms  but im not among them  
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie  i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham   because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by  its hard to understand why the rights were optioned  
sphere is the kind of first class mess that only a topline director with an alist cast can create  
with expectations high  and how could they not be  considering that another barry levinsondustin hoffman collaboration  the excellent wag the dog  is still playing in theaters    
something this bad cant help but look even worse  
the last time a bigname  bigbudget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last years batman  robin  and everyone knows how that movie was received  
sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james camerons the abyss  but  somewhere along the way  it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort  event horizon  
science and philosophy  which are used to good effect during spheres first hour  give way to mindless  confusing action sequences  
attempts at characterization fall apart  
intelligent writing  which is evident early on  is replaced by hackneyed drivel  
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness  
but all that is just in preparation for the ending  which is inexcusably awful  
this is the timehonored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect  
i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film  
there is some promise  but its all in the setup  
were introduced to norman goodman  dustin hoffman   a psychologist who once wrote a    report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered  
when one is found in the middle of nowhere   feet below the surface of the pacific ocean  norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee  
on the team with him are beth halperin  sharon stone   a biochemist who was once his student and lover  harry adams  samuel l  jackson   a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of   ted fielding  liev schreiber   an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology  and harold barnes  peter coyote   the government operative in charge of the mission  
together  the five descend into the bowels of the ocean  where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact  
for a while  sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the manmeetsalien situation  
the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists  such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship  apparently from the future  offer intriguing possibilities  
then  right around the onehour mark  thats the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatevers left of titanic   the virtually nonstop action begins  and  once it starts  the script becomes superfluous  
this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension  but  instead  he relies on loud  overbearing music  strange camera angles  and quick cuts to make things  exciting   
additionally  because none of the characters are wellformed  a common failing in anything penned by crichton  whos more interested in technology than people   viewers dont develop much of a rooting interest  
it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience  
what about that alist cast  
not surprisingly  the most energetic performance is given by samuel l  jackson  but his harry isnt a person  hes a walking plot device spouting occasionallywitty dialogue  
dustin hoffman isnt lively or particularly good  its ironic that this  which may be his worst work in a decade  has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination  for wag the dog   
sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat  
their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion  automatons would have been as effective  
then theres queen latifa  who  despite getting fifth billing in the credits  ahead of liev schreiber  who boasts at least quadruple her screen time   has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count  
i like to think that levinson and hoffman  recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be  chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance  the lowbudget picture was filmed during spheres lengthy preproduction phase   
if thats the case  forgiveness is granted  
im less inclined to look favorably upon crichton  although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume  jurassic park and the levinsondirected disclosure come to mind   
even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process  crichtons credit as a producer disallows him absolution  
he was a willing participant in a creative travesty  
no wonder sphere is being released in february  in the midst of the early years cinematic wasteland  
it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic  which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninthconsecutive weekend atop the box office heap
