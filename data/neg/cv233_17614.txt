at times  youd think edtv would be an entertaining film  
i mean  who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day  
but this average joe  ed perkuny   matthew mcconaughay   is a sappy  lifeless creation that wanders around  trying to solve everyones problems and settle his own  
mcconaughay is awful  especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a  week beard and torn jeans  
frankly  he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys  
he overacts in every way  his overexaggerant body language  obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance  and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life  and drops to his knee and cries  
the rest of the cast is very good  especially martin landau  as eds stepfather   who plays a cute role as the closetodeath old guy that makes all the witty comments  
jenna elfman is good   but a little overemotional   her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films  i  e  
cant hardly wait  and krippendorfs tribe  
woody harrelson  as eds brother ray  does his usual eggheaded role  with his comic wit as well  he wrote a book entitled   my brother pissed on me    
elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut  and dennis hopper  in a quick cameo as eds biological father  is a nice choice  ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show   
ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who  after awhile  decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec  rob reiners opinion  
i hate to compare this film to the truman show  but the fact is  i was ashamed to see this movie  
it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed  
edtv had no real wit or genius  it was typical hollywood  
extracting the tv part of the movie  you have the simple plotline  man steals brothers girlfriend  girlfriend leaves town  man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on  slut breaks up with him  real girlfriend comes back  and voila  you have a romance  
i got so restless during this movie  i almost walked out  
the only reason it doesnt drop below a  c  grade is because of the fine supporting performances  
adam  i almost lost my nose    and 
i like it  
i like breathing through it
