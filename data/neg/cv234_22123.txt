five years after his directorial debut based on stephen kings writings called the shawshank redemption     writerdirector frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king  
unlike the latter film  this one is a big  long  laborious bore  
plot  a sevenfoot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers  
critique  this film is slow  drawnout  boring  uninteresting  unexciting  predictable and topped with a couple of onedimensional  evil  characters  
its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles  
the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward  unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about  
of course  much like all other death row cell blocks  this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be  misunderstood   except for one cookiecutter crazy guy who is evil personified  
and lets not forget all the guards on death row  who also happen to be angels from the heaven above  except for one cookiecutter crazy guard who is also evil personified  and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates      
am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film  
or even more importantly  am i supposed to give a rats ass about anyone in this film  
well  if i was  i sure missed that boat  because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin  
furthermore  there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyones life to present this story  
in fact  the story is empty within itself  
i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal  and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not  
wow  
how interesting  
the plots utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film  we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie   
whip out those thinking caps  kids  
hmmm  and i wonder what will happen to those two cookiecutter  evil  guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity  
hmmmm  now think hard here  boys and girls  
what a crock  
i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some threehour exercise in spirituality  but unfortunately for me  it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging  
in fact  it was one big bore  
i didnt see the point of the movie  i didnt see the point of the story and i certainly didnt see the point in tom hanks big doublechin  
all in all  a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work  especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour  john coffey  
give that man an award or something
