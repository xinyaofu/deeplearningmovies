working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a frontline african american actress like jada pinkett smith  
despite being one of the freshest talents available  pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts  a low down dirty shame  the nutty professor   
the problem is  of course  that there arent many good roles available for black women  
take away the likes of waiting to exhale  set it off  soul food  and eves bayou  and all thats left is a chance to be someones girlfriend  a local whore  or a murder victim  
as a result  for pinkett smiths first opportunity atop the marquee  she is stuck in a stupid  formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo  
actually  woo  the latest directorial effort from daisy v  s  
mayer  party girl   could have been worse than it is  
the film offers a few funny  albeit juvenile  moments and the onscreen relationship between pinkett smiths woo and tommy davidsons tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two arent forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags  
unfortunately  huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a tripledigit i  q  
the situations are painfully contrived  the main characters are lifted right out of sitcoms  and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of  free lobotomy  lab experiment  
woo is a spontaneous  energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places  
her latest relationship  with a testosteroneoverdosed drugdealer  came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper  
now  her transvestitemedium friend celestrial  girlina  predicts that shes about to meet mr  right  and that hell be a virgo  
later that day  woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim  a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order  who just happens to be a virgo  
its not love at first sight  however  
things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass  and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a  quiet  dinner  
in the onehundred year history of motion pictures  there have been a ton of bad  white  movies about mismatched lovers  so i suppose its only fair that we get a  black  effort of the same low caliber  
as in all romantic comedies  we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together  
the question is  are their courtship rituals entertaining  
in a good entry to the genre  the audience becomes caught up in the love story  no matter how familiar it is  
in woo  the constant reliance upon unfunny  moronic humor sinks the project  
for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes  theres a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself  added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top   
sadly  thats one of the films most enjoyable sequences  and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional  
despite exuding charm from every pore  theres little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c  johnsons script  
since it misses the mark by so much  a better name for woo might have been whoops
