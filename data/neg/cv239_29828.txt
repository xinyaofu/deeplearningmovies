susan grangers review of  mulholland drive   universal focus  
whatever david lynch is selling  im not buying  
from the writerdirector of  blue velvet  and  twin peaks  comes another dark  mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive  the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills  
dazed  a beautiful brunette  laura elena harring  emerges and stumbles down a hill  slipping unobserved into a sstyle apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip  
the next morning  a dewy blonde  naomi watts  from deep river  ontario  arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase  
her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet  
the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust  
meanwhile  a hotshot director  justin theroux   whose wife is in bed with the poolman  is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and theres an assassin  mark pellegrino  roaming the city  
the tortuous paths of these various characters  and others named cookie  coco and cowboy  intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because  midway through the story  lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality  leaving a huge wad of cash  a blue metallic key  a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered  
elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses  effectively making the subtle switch  
the same cannot be said for former m  g  m  
dancer ann miller whos stiff and selfconscious  speaking  like most lynch players  in staccato tones  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    mulholland drive  is a frenzied  frustrating   originally designed as an episodic tv pilot  this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out
