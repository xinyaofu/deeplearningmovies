hey  ive got a great idea for a movie  
ok  here it is  well get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so  
whats that  
sounds too boring  
ok  how about this then  we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours  but half of them are angry looks and half of them are  im in pain   
looks  
whats that  
that still doesnt sound funny to you  
how about if we through in some  ewwwww   
looks  
still not funny  
if you answered  no  that doesnt sound funny   then  ding ding ding   
youre absolutely correct  
for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple  played by tim allen and kirstie alley  who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant  wayne knight  best know as newman on tvs  seinfeld   gets them in trouble for tax evasion  
what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed  minutes of cinema hell  
what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs  
  
  
namely  talent  
backing up  the married couple is brad and caroline sexton  allen and alley   a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else  but in reality are on the brink of divorce  
just as their marriage seems to be hanging from its final thread  brad discovers that his accountant  bob lachman  knight   has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sextons names  
the irs catches on  but since everything points back to the sextons and not lachman  there is nothing much to do  
  
  
except run away and join an amish community  
first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckleoutloud moments  and even some decent laughs here and  way  over there  but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that youll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn  
alley is absolutely unwatchable  and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade  which  i inform you  was total b  s    
allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons  nor are they very convincing as an amish couple  
this entire movie is one bad illconceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning  
the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing  
its such a trite  stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast  noticing that theyre all predominantly tv figures  were probably the only ones they could get  
bryan spicers directing doesnt help one bit  either  
in fact  listing spicers filmography  which includes the first  power rangers  movie and the big screen adaption of mchales navy  is more of an insult than a r  sum   
now that ive pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground  i will let you in on the best thing about it  
it bumped seven films up a notch on my  worst of   movie list  
thats right  thanks to this film ranking at number  for the years worst  six films are now not seemingly as bad  and a smile like yours  previously inhabiting the number ten spot  now doesnt have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list  
if you look at it in that respect  for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all
