even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material  as this subpar submarine comedy proves  
down periscope stars kelsey  frasier  grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officers  james coburn  plan to get him out of the navy  
like any lame emsemble comedy  the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out  the fat guy who eats all the time  the beautiful woman who doesnt belong there  lauren holly   the secondincommand who does everything by the book  rob schneider   the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out  harry dean stanton  and so on  
then comes the transparent plotline  
first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him  and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard  
after the ship is fixed up come the early drills  where everyone seems completely inept  like the electrician who cant connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone  
finally  and this covers the final hour of the movie  grammer has to lead his men  and holly  to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise  
and he has to be a clever rebel to do it  in scenes that stretch all levels of believability  
first theyre singing  louie louie  like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off  then thirty minutes later  theyre making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off  
the whole while  evil captain coburn is overacting underwater  cursing grammer  as most people watching the movie probably are too   
its all predictable without any original humor to redeem it  
the jokes are right out of  mchales navy  and other cutrate sitcoms of the past  
theres one scene where schneider looks through the ships pantry in disgust  holds one food can up and announces   this expired in    
i yelled back at the screen   so did these jokes   
i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it  
my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and  around the start of the second hour  i started writing my will  
the blame cant really be placed on the stars  though  
kelsey grammer is good in this  he just doesnt have anything to work with  
his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had  welcome aboard  tatooed on his penis  
grammer probably did something even worse  got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about  
same for holley  save the penis part   who is likeable in down periscope just because shes so gorgeous  
as for schneider  whose character is downright annoying   there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas  although hes still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the  snl  ship  
my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy   okay  its police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber    and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster  
judging from the video box  most other movie critics agree with me  
the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channels jim ferguson  
i guess even jeff craig from   second preview   who said tank girl  kicks butt   
without ever seeing it  didnt like this
