the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie  if you dont count neil simons biloxi blues   
year after year  more predictably cliched military movies come out  most recently sgt  
bilko  and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last  
i thought stripes would be different  
with ivan reitman as director  bill murray as star and harold ramis as costar and coscreenwriter  it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army  
instead  it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army  
murray  about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs  plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success  and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him  
so he does  and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell  headshaving and marchingsinging sequences  more mindnumbingly stale here than ever  
the characters are even less original  ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette  
all the big name stars in stripes  and even larroquette  fall victim to the lame  rehashed material and are never really likeable  murray in particular  
he only gets a few decent lines in  although those barelyfunny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters  
he was even better in caddyshack  for crying out loud  
as with a lot of the late s  early s comedies  stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex obsessed no child should be able to watch it  
im sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over  to mud wrestle five beautiful women  but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition  dear god   
every few seconds  
stripes isnt the playful kind of sex comedy  either  
most of the time it seems downright misogynistic  as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the womens showers or murray lifts a female m  p  
onto the stove and  with an iknowwhatyoulike look on his face  says hes going to give her the  aunt jemima treatment   which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly  
you dont want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region  
  im not enjoying this   the woman protests  
my sentiments exactly
