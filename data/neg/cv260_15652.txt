i have never been a  star trek  fan  and  to tell the truth  out of the five films in the series that i have seen             i have disliked all of them  
i do  however  always go into one of these with an open mind  and the ninth film in the series   star trek  insurrection   is no exception  
dropping almost completely the hardcore scifi element of the previous one in the series   first contact    insurrection   tells the story of a planet that holds only  people  known as the baku  as well as the fountain of youth  
at the start of the picture  the villagers go under attack by a second alien species  known as the sona  who want to push all of the baku out so that their own race will not die out  
also attacking the baku is data  brent spiner   a robot from the star trek enterprise  
after returning to jeanluc picard  patrick stewart  and the gang on their space ship  no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force  
so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the baku  where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants  a sultry  kind alien woman  donna murphy   who is over sixhundredyearsold  but looks to only be in her thirties  
  star trek  insurrection   is a completely unoriginal and cheaplooking installment in the series  and is a big step down from  s  first contact   which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different  
in   insurrection   however  it plays like a lowrent episode of the television show  due to the smallscale  generic storyline  and an emphasis on oneliners rather than excitement  
the film was filled with nearly nonstop comedy  and worse yet  most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff  
meanwhile  when there were action sequences  they were not at all interesting or inventive  relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very  very slowly  
this plot device  which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays  is getting old fast  
are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax  
another element of   star trek   films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest  but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later  
although donna murphy  who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here  is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the minute running time  alfre woodard was far superior in   first contact   
she should have returned for this one  but i dont blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movies disappointing and often lifeless screenplay  by michael piller  
  star trek  insurrection   is perhaps the weakest film in the  star trek   series  although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst   star trek v  the final frontier   
  insurrection   is the type of  safe  sequel that will bewilder nonfans  since it is so lowtech compared to most of todays blockbuster action films  although most of these are honestly not very good  either   and should disappoint the loyal trekkies  since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts  
on second thought  they probably should have completely thrown the script out  
that way  they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness
