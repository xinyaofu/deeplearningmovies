i suppose its unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk  which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since its  release  
michael lehmanns actioncomedy was quick to win the title biggest box office flop of all time  or close thereof  
the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk  whos just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation  let me put it this way   he explains  i never saw et   
greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime  played by danny aiello   who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes  
these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags  cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences  
it appears as if director lehmann didnt know when to stop all the absurd silliness  and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line  
if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldnt get goofier  youll soon be eating your words  
but  im inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as its box office numbers suggest  
its fastpaced and entertaining  if youve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor  
for the first portion of this review  im going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk  
wish me luck  
first and foremost  bruce willis is a good sport  
while im not entirely sure what he was smoking when he cowrote this script  willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big  fat  ugly joke  
he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and outofplace  which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions  
another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character  
they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican  and their relationship escalates in interest from there  
its unfortunate that mcdowells onenote character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plottwist  and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis  
but now im rambling on again about the negative things  arent i  
enough of the charade  for the most part  hudson hawk is an excruciating experience  
its stupid  pointless and repetitive  
i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater  because this film really doesnt have the potential to please anyone  
action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of  comedy  and even the action sequences are skittery  rushed and poorly edited  
and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headacheinducing hijinks  
dont get me wrong  this film is not devoid of laughs  
its too bad most of them are unintentional  or just plain forced  
the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed  
its understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber  but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn im not entirely sure  
coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play  and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie  
especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown  and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film  
things get more bizarre when were introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars  including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless  cardflipping kitkat  
if thats not enough for you  theres richard e  grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover  
their crotchbiting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here  
wait  maybe the only big laughs    
im not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk  
i cant even begin to start about the films absurd plot  but lets not get into that  
i suppose theres some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise  if they were that desperate  
but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where its going from minute one  and from there its  minutes of pure cinematic muck
