if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film  it was studio   the late steve rubells infamous new york discotheque  which came to symbolize the taboosmashing excesses of the disco eras heyday  easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone  all set to a thumping dance beat  
so when miramax started production on  last year  the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began  an edgy film as downanddirty as the club itself  written and directed by a promising firsttimer  mark christopher  and starring some hot young talent  salma hayek  neve campbell  newcomer ryan phillippe  and mike myers in his dramatic debut   
my  how easily does the worm turn  
hype turned into damage control when word got out about thhour reshoots  wrapped only a month ago   a rash of studioimposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew  especially christopher  unhappy  and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics  
at the last minute  though  miramax did decide to screen the film  so hastily scheduled was the screening that myerss last name was misspelled on the invitation  not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes  for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed  myself included  
and with good reasonsomehow  some way  the supremely disappointing  has made the historically hip haven of hedonism    
boring  
although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film  he still must shoulder some of the blame for s lifelessness  
 focuses  for the most part  on a tightknit trio of employees at the club  coat check girlaspiring disco diva anita  a wasted hayek   her busboy husband  greg  breckin meyer   and  most prominently  the freshfromjersey shane oshea  phillippe   who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender  
these characters are about as generic as those descriptions  
in focusing on the hired help  christopher really missed the boat  
with the exception of the flamboyant  alwayswoozy rubell  myers  in a wellmodulated turn   the meaty stories to be told at studio  are not the workers but those of the people who went there to party  not necessarily the numerous vip guests  but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the clubs famously hardass doormen and dance  among other things  the night away with the rich  famous  and infamous  the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dows feisty dottie  a disco and drugcrazed granny  but shes a peripheral character at best   
as such  aside from the expected overhead crowd shots  there is precious little actual dancing in   
what is a disco filmespecially one about the pinnacle of the movementwithout the dancing  
even whit stillmans thelastdaysofdisco  which wasnt so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hiptoonlythemselves clubhopping preppies  featured at least one extended dance scene  
dancing isnt the only thing glazed over in so is the sex  but that may not be entirely christophers fault  
from what ive heard  his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring  starting with the shane character  he was conceived  and actually filmed  as a wild  morally ambiguous bisexual  which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio s legend  
but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut  shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out  consequently  so was the film  
aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film  shanes fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie  sela ward   and an abbreviated bedhopping montage  the sexual dimension is just about ignored  
shane  in this incarnation  is sanitized to the point of blandness  an idealistic dogooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club  julie black  campbell   a worldly soap star with  yes  a heart of gold  
this tackedon  romance  would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience  
they fail on both counts  
ultimately  s failure comes down to three letters  fun  
as in  there isnt any to be had for the audience  
too much time is spent with the boring shane  and too little is spent on the club floor  where all the action took place  
anyhow  though  whatever time is spent on the  floor is not used very effectively  
when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club  it should be a euphoric height  for her  the crowd  and the audience  however  the moment doesnt get a chance to reach that level  for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality  which also mars the films conclusion  one of the lastminute reshoots   
strangely upbeat and wistful  the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying  
there is an interesting portrait of studio  out theretwo of them  in factbut  is not one of them  
theyre on cable tv  a couple of documentaries produced by e  and vh  
these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goingson within it show that theres still a great disco movie to be made  
the problem is  after the critical and certain box office failure of   the subject may have run its hollywood course
