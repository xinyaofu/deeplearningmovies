the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits  
the rationale is sound  but in many cases of this and recent years  the sequel is a shoddy product thats exposed for the cashmilking vehicle it really is  
last years speed  and scream   as well as this years species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory  
in some cases  a sequel can even discredit its predecessor  as with the latest neoslasher flick  i still know what you did last summer  
whatever uniqueness the original mightve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller  
julie james  jennifer love hewitt  and ray bronson  freddie prinze jr   are back from the original to star in i still know  reprising their roles in typical fashion  
julie and ray experience a rather predictable fallingout at the beginning of the movie  leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson  matthew settle   
will and julie hit it off  and along with friends karla  brandy norwood  and tyrell  mekhi phifer   the foursome heads off to a radio stationgiveaway vacation in the tropics  
unfortunately  things arent so peachy once they arrive  and with a regularity you could set your watch by  the infamous fisherman  muse watson  is back with his hook  
its another bloody showdown  complete with cliffhanger ending  
theres not much thats original about i still know  and with the market saturated by genx thrillers like this one  its unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel  
for diehard fans of the genre  this will be required viewing material  but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer  
the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isnt heightened by skillful scripting or camera work  but rather a tense  stringbased score and manipulative editing  
the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue  he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments  
much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point  
the whole reason the plot exists  julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station  is a dead giveaway  lessening suspense and creating a hurryupandwait timing problem  
and  whereas the killers identity mightve been a question in the first movie  its almost a given here  which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically  
three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as  the killer   
theyre almost used to it  and the performances show it  not hewitt  nor prinze  nor brandy  nor phifer give a decent show  
and so  in the end  its left wide open for a third movie and  most likely  a brand new supporting cast  
god help us
