a film that means well  but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama  
its jeroen krabb  s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in  who cant forget their bitter past  
the heroine is an attractive  carefree  nonreligious yearold  chaja  fraser   who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations  screwing a student rebel leader  and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother  s  gebrecht  and her selfabsorbed  eccentric father  schell   
her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps  and her home life is filled with angst  
her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything  while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos  a family album  silverware  and his old violin  
he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis  but cant locate them now due to all the changes in the city  
out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment  she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building  mr  apfelschnitt  topol   tells her about  
the hasidics are ultraorthodox  they dont go to the cinema or watch tv  adhere to strict dress codes  and strictly observe their religious laws  
chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules  but soon finds the wife  mrs  kalman  rossellini   to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her  children  a yearold named simcha  monty  who doesnt talk  
the stern mr  kalman  krabb   is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses  
to hammer home the point of how antisemitism hasnt gone away theres a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge  bradley   who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator  
the film is done in by its hamfisted script as the story  adapted from carl friedmans book  the shovel and the loom   goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality  
it starts off telling chajas story of how shes a lost jewess trying to find her identity  then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment  and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that cant be forgotten  
the effort seemed heavyhanded  as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters  
the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring  chajas parents are given no human shades  while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was onedimensional and falsely acted  
the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser  whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt  but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots  while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence  but is strong in accepting her faith  
topols reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser  acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense  
the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it cant love  it starts out by showing how under chajas loving care hes taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away  beginning by saying quack  quack and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder  
but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence  refuses to speak because of his stern dad  and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident  the film thereby exploits the boys sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done  
i felt i didnt just see a movie  but i attended a lecture for the whole  minutes of this serious but unappetizing story  
it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon  as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarilythe message it keeps sending was already received  
in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage  one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past  
that seems strange  since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about  
unless i was mistaken and the films real aim was to make us cry over simcha
