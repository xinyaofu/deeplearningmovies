porter stoddard  warren beatty  is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie  diane keaton  for twentyfive years  
they and best friends mona  goldie hawn  and griffin  garry shandling  are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen   town and country   
  town and country  has a pedigree befitting its title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry   the graduate   under the direction of peter chelsom   funny bones    
after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates  the media has been prepped for beattys next  ishtar   
so  is it that bad  
the answer is no  
but its not very good either  
the major problem with  town and country  is that its unstructured and random  
stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer  having just bedded a flaky cellist  nastassja kinski   
next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin  
then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings  buck henry cameos as both couples divorce lawyer   
ellie thinks shes overeacting  but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her familys mississippi manse  
the two childhood friends end up in bed together  making us wonder why theyd never become a couple to begin with  
back home  their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porters cheating on her  
porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley  idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that hes gay  
the four friends  along with every woman porters dallied with  all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after  
although the film begins promisingly  resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps  too many strands drift off into nowhere  
the stoddard household is huge  containing two adult children  josh hartnett   the virgin suicides  and tricia vessey   kiss the girls    their colorful bedmates and a maid whos just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home  
after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack  the six supporting players are dropped except for an outofnowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son  
porters romantic misadventures with women  other than mona  are equally mishandled  
once the marital discord begins  the film seems as if it was editted with a machete  stopping and starting  never regaining its rhythm  
while beatty gets off a few tart observations  his character is mostly passive and bemused  
maybe were supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesnt initiate his own sex romps  
keatons ellie has a trusting nature thats a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character  
hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of  the out of towners  and  the first wives club  while shandlings relegated to true second banana status  
kinski is bland and unmotivated  
andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplays most bizarre subplot  which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting  billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic  wheelchairbound  foulmouthed mother  
heston and seldes are fun  as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party  
oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look  but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like  hear my song  and  funny bones   
the script is this films weakest link  its telling that most of the  few  laughs come from oldfashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit  
while  town and country  isnt exactly painful to sit through  it mostly just lays there
