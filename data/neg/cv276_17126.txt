   the following review contains spoilers   
  please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie   
 chuck dowling  the jacksonville film journal 
i wrote the above sentence in my review for s batman and robin  
apparently  no one heard my words  
oh  how i wish you had heard them  
oh how i wish someone had stopped him    
because hes done it again  
the plot of mm is similar to the  paul schrader film hardcore  a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale  
in fact  it was everything that mm is not  
in the opening minutes of mm  we see private detective tom welles  nicolas cage  working on a case for a prestigious member of the u  s  government  
keep this fact in mind  cage is trusted with an important case  which he solves  
he returns home to his wife and new daughter  and even finds time to rake his yard  keep that in mind too  its important as well   
hes hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery  
after her husbands death she comes across a film in his private safe  
it appears to be snuff film  a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera  
the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film  hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film  
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film  
the main problem with mm is that the whole film is completely pointless  
welles is actually selected for the case by the old womans lawyer  anthony heald  an actor who always plays the same type of character  that being a bad guy   
when you first see him  your first instinct is that hes behind the whole thing  
the choice of casting does the film in  
then  as welles begins his investigation  at times we will see a shadowy figure following him  
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer  or someone sent by the lawyer  because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet  
so your first instinct has now been confirmed  
then  when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing  he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced  in one of those ridiculous  since were going to kill you anyway  why not tell you the whole thing  moments   
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case hes told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended  
huh  
also  when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing  his main goal is to get the film back  
so why did he give it up in the first place   
the lawyer had the film the whole time  then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film   
its totally absurd    
and this is the screenwriter of seven  
late in the film theres a confrontation between all the main characters  and after a struggle one of the characters guns ends up underneath a car  
cage  who has been handcuffed to a bed  is rapidly trying to get to his gun  which is on a table  
james gandolfinis character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of  suspense   
you see  the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car hes trying to reach it from  and so instead of going around the car to the other side  where he can easily reach it  he just keeps stretching  
go around to the other side of the car   
this goes on for minutes  
then  after cage gets his gun  gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car  
boy  schumacher is really really getting on my nerves  
i think the final straw would be when cage returns home  devastated by everything that hes seen on this case  and then is no longer able to rake his lawn  
we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard  
other things that bugged me about mm  one would be the music  if you can call it that  
whenever the score starts up  it sounds like techno music  and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it  
awful decision there joel  
another is cages performance  
at this point hes capable of a wide range of performances  either good or bad  
for mm  he delivers a very wooden one  and only shines when hes interacting with joaquin phoenix  who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case   
youre capable of much better mr  cage  
now as for you mr  schumacher    
im starting to doubt if youre capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema
