here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy  bait  starring jamie foxx and david morse  
this is a review i dont even want to write because id just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other sogenericandpredictableitsbeyondridiculous piece of hollywood fluff  
if theyre not going to give us  the audience  just a little credit and put something together with half a brain  why should i waste my time and mental energy criticising it  
last summer i took this same approach with my review of  the mummy   in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other subpar movies  
i think i shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes  not all are applicable   
i hope this goes to show you what i think of  bait  and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild guess  
its genuinely unfunny  i  and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours   unoriginal and unthrilling  
its not so bad to the point where its fun to watch because of its badness and its no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it  its just such a cliche in and of itself  that  uhh    
lost my train of thought  
anyways  heres those quotes  enjoy  
  getting an audiences attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how todays films work  
we want to have something exciting to watch  not a slow buildup of a story  god forbid    and this film plays right into the mainstreams hands     
 review of  armageddon   
  its clear the film doesnt want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability  the most minimal amount necessary  comes across as a halfassed effort  
supporting characters and shady supplots are introduced  but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters  only a handful have any real significance    
theres a fine line separating homage from plagiarism       review of  godzilla     
  unfortunately  as is the case with most modern thrillers  once the film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence  the cliches and action sequences take over    review of  the jackal
