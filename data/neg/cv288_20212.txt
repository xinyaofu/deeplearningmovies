the th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canines least appetizing residue  
the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector  
my vote goes for the ending credits  where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you  
ibn fahdlan  antonio banderas  is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another mans wife  
he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by  men  
fahdlan is chosen as the th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter  
the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas  whos acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in s philadelphia  than that of a warrior  
in the films supposed pay off scene  he exclaims  i was wrong  these are not men    
a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production  
unfortunately  banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chases career look like oscar material  
the film  based on michael crichtons best selling novel  eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago  and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony  but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow  
at the same time  the th warrior makes you think about numerous questions  
questions like  why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark    
  why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face  but rather just one side   
and finally   will the manager give me a refund   
 minutes into the  minute film  a man invites of the warriors  come with me  there is a woman who can help   
unfortunately  there is nothing that could help this film  
the most appropriate ending would have been for the  men to join hands  form a chorus line  and break into a rendition of  springtime for hitler
