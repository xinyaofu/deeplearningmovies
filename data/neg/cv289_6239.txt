ive heard it called  jaws with claws  and thats a fair summation of the plot  though that tag line does little to quantify quality  
director stephen hopkins  blown away  predator   and screenwriter william goldman  maverick  misery  would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature  based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the th century  
theyve stacked the deck with two big stars  val kilmer  michael douglas   a bigger production design  beautiful photography  by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond   and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music  
the movie doesnt make a lick of sense  though  either as an epic or as your basic boofest  
in fact  some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think youve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater   the movie  
how about the three guys with rifles  who trap a lion and then cant even hit the damned thing  
or the hamonwry acting of michael douglas  who chews more scenery than the animals ever do   
or  my favorite  lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops
