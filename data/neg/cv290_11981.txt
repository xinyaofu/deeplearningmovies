billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy  
he tries to infuse some life into it  but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication  
sammy  billy crystal  is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes  
hes separated from his wife  serena  kathleen quinlan   and down to his last serious client    in a lowbudget film shooting in romania  
but in a turn of bad luck  sammy wrecks his car    only 
to be mysteriously saved by a giant  gheorghe muresan   
but this giant has a heart of gold  
he leads a solitary life  helping out the monks at a local monastery  
his only longing is for his long lost love  lilianna  joanna pacula   who has since moved to america  
sammy  seeing a golden ticket  convinces max to become an actor  represented by sammy  of course   and come back to america  
and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job  with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before maxs nose  
but slowly sammys deceptions begin to haunt him  
but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned  
the humor in my giant isnt the worlds greatest  
mostly  it falls under the category of  boy    hes 
so big    
and that can only go so far  no matter how hard the talent tries  
still  its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments  
the films best moment  and thats not saying much  is a bit part by steven seagal  playing himself  
between executive decision and this  all of seagals best roles have been cameos  
maybe he should consider a change of work  steven seagal  the character actor  
gheorghe muresan isnt a natural actor at all  and his thick cottonmouthed accent certainly doesnt help  
in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature  
originally  the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant  
andre also had a hefty accent  but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride    something 
muresan should have studied for some pointers  
why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies  
hes proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be  and yet  like a glutton for punishment  he keeps coming back  
that doesnt mean we have to
