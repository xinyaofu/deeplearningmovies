movies can do the two big es very well  educate and entertain  
in the best of all possible worlds  they accomplish both  
on the red planet  they fail entirely  
in the near future  a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth  
this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be  
after some mumbojumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet  the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does  
the ground crew of people you couldnt care less about is trapped on the surface without food  water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog  
the one potentially interesting character  carrieanne moss  spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer  
attempting to graft    esque space mysticism with  terminator  robot horror  first time director antony hoffman cant seem to figure out whats going on  
neither can we  
didnt he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story  
couldnt he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter  
there are so many missteps  
every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction  
why introduce the theme of faith vs  science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die offscreen  
the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen  
two hours later  theyre still waiting  
despite our greatest hopes  there is no life on the red planet
