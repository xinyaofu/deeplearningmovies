its tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city  
just ask mr  furious  ben stiller   the blue raja  hank azaria   and the shoveler  william h  macy   
theyre trying to break into the biz  but captain amazing  greg kinnear   the citys hero numero uno  hogs all the action  
the good captain has his own problems  
because hes all but eliminated crime  amazings endorsement deals are falling through  
the public craves a major slugfest  so amazing engineers the parole of his onetime arch enemy casanova frankenstein  geoffrey rush   
frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations  he captures capt  amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city  
so  no one is left to save the day but our wouldbe superheroes  but their abilities are more  little league  than  justice league   
the raja hurls forks at foes  the shoveler hits them with a shovel  and mr  furious just yells at people  stiller is doing essentially the same character he played in a guest appearance on  friends    
after a painful first strike  the guys hold auditions for teammates and add the bowler  janeane garofalo   who carries her dead fathers skull in her bowling ball  invisible boy  kel mitchell   who can only use his powers when no one is looking at him  the spleen  paul reubens   who blows devastating winds from his rear  and the sphinx  wes studi   a mysterious figure who will teach them to fight  
  mystery men  boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled  
in addition to those already mentioned  the credits include lena olin as frankensteins evil shrink  comedian eddie izzard and the fugees prakazrel michel as discothemed thugs  singer tom waits as an inventor of superhero weapons  artie lange  from  mad tv   as another thug  claire forlani  from  meet joe black   as a waitress mr  furious is pursuing  louise lasser  from  mary hartman  mary hartman   as the blue rajas mother  and actormagician ricky jay as capt  amazings manager  
the cast includes four oscarnominated actors  
when i saw the list of players early last year  i figured the result would be a cantmiss comedy  
yet  i must report disappointment  
the script is probably the worst of   
nearly every joke misfires  
the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny  
  for example  no one can recognize capt  amazing in his secret identity because hes wearing glasses   
the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work  
the cast tries hard  especially hank azaria  whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume  but the script is just too lame to run
