your first clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see  its heavily christmasthemed and its release date is  oh  say  at the end of february  
your second clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see  charlize theron  one of the movies dubious stars  makes an appearance on the daily show in which  when asked if her new movies any good  she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh    
assuring us that  yeah  it sure is a movie  all right  
and theres some scenes like those youd expect to find in a movie  and theres some action    
and theres other    
stuff    
too  
how to immediately grab my attention  open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits  
then show a caption reading  six days earlier     
ya know  i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas    
how to immediately lose my attention  follow your opening scene with a terminally dull niceguyswhodontdeservetobeinprison scene  
write a line for the one of prisoners like  i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad   
then  have ben affleck actually say that line  on film  and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor  
for good measure  throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have afflecks best buddy stabbed    
aw    
and just two days before his release  too  
already the cliches are piled on thick  and when it rains  it pours  
how to take my attention  dash it violently against the rocks  and make it so that im contemplating my strategy for calling  shotgun  about an hour before i know the credits will roll  deny your characters the ability to think  
have ben affleck  for some reason ill never understand  pretend hes his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend  played by charlize theron  
have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist  
the villains big idea  
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino  force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are  then dress up in santa suits  create some  diversions  and rob the place  
on paper  it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy  but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks hes looking at the makings for some sort of clever actioncrime thriller  
its not like the man isnt capable    
far from it  
hes the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may  
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases ive ever seen in last years ronin  
but hes certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers    
put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his  version of the island of dr  moreau  
step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible  cast ben affleck in the role of the worlds most generic hero  
he gets no good oneliners  he doesnt get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways  and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie  
his name is rudy  short for rudolph  in all likelihood  
see  its called reindeer games  
get it  
get it  
shut up   
in the past  affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor  and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man  
step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible  gary sinises villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with  
hes dirty and pottymouthed  hes got long  scruffy hair and a goatee  and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them  
hes also extremely inept at what he does  
he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises  and he trusts afflecks character to pull through even after  time and time and time again  he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him  
but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role  sinise seems to think hes playing some sort of tough  smart  and smooth criminal mastermind  rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script  
on a side note  gary sinise wins this weeks  title   
award  as hes the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings  
last weeks winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards   
how to take your bad idea and make things worse  include two or three plot twists that  instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent  make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely  
this is a bad movie  
and whats worse is that  except for a few moments near the notsostunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous  reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad  
if theyd done that much  at least i would have been entertained
