the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as anywhere but here   
there isnt one thing about this motherdaughter relationship melodrama that felt honest  
it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives  as for some reason they couldnt figure it out for themselves  
if the film looks familiar  that is because  the slums of beverly hills     went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances  in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with  
alvin sargents script was weak and annoyingly claustral  
wayne wangs   the joy luck club   inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldnt convey  
pushy mother adele august  susan sarandon  forces her yearold daughter ann  natalie portman  to leave a small midwestern burg to go crosscountry with her to beverly hills  
the daughter resents her twice divorced  unstable but exotic  schoolteacher mother  bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life  
the daqughter doesnt even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and cant stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio  
so it becomes a question of who knows best  as the ladies fight it out between them  until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner  
adeles dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesnt look that good  as she lands a job in a slum school  has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids  and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive  
daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there  
during one of many arguments with her freespirited mom  they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed  she runs away  only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop  michael milhoan   who offers her wise counsel  
with the cops zen wisdom passed onto the daughter  she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches  and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla  
during their stay in beverly hills  she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer a t  s

but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality  as everything seemed staged and unemotional  
when she learns her cousin benny  shawn hatosy   who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin  she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasnt clearly shown why she wants to stay there  and for that matter  it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly  
the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams  
i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say  is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one  able to recognize mothers faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself  
mother has a series of setbacks  like being dumped by her dreamboat dentist  bochner  she met on the beach  and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part  
but mother learns that her daughter has grownup and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her  
she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do  is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do  
this of course results in the corny ending  showing that moms heart was always in the right place  only she went about it in the wrong way  
this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing
