tomb raider  
fun  
exciting  
challenging  
given the unprecedented popularity  especially among teenage boys  of the video game that sports an uberbuff  pistol packin babe who raids  well    
tombs  you have to believe its these three things and more  
  lara croft  tomb raider   the big screen variant of said video game  which features a pumpedup angelina jolie  the oscar  winner for  girl  interrupted  no less  in the title role is  however  none of these things  
it isnt fun  it isnt exciting  and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat  i suffered through to the bitter  bitter end  the wife opted for barnes  noble at the minute mark   
directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to  con air    tomb raider  is an emptyheaded  big budget bore  
the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys  hudson hawk   the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that  when brought together  well    
who the heck cares   and it makes  super mario bros    bob hoskins illadvised career move  look like  rocco and his brothers   that classic of italian neorealism   
ill go out on a limb here and say i suspect theres actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper  
this is where the jolie defendersvideo game nuts jump in and say this movie isnt about character development its about kicking serious butt  or bum  since ms  croft hails from englands green and pleasant   
with lips  breasts  and biceps all inflated to the max  lara croft is all about posturing  and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough  
ok  lets forget challenging  
shouldnt  tomb raider  be  at the very least  fun and exciting  
shouldnt our buttkicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of  say  james bond with the wit of indiana jones  
theres no humor to be found anywhere in  tomb raider   even though it tries hard from time to time  
even  the mummy returns  didnt take itself too seriously  
the villain here is noticeably lacking  the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated  and the script is nonexistent  
to liven things up  perhaps   jolies live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as laras dead father lord croft  talk about a stretch  
one thing i hadnt expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa  although i suspect that thinlooking moustache hes forced to wear gets in the way some   
unsuccessful  not entirely  
if anything   lara croft  tomb raider  makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about
