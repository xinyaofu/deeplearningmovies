heres something to chew on  whats the favorite food of big  cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising  
the obvious answer to this question is cardboard  because thats the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature  
deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer  
in fact  considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas  perhaps it was  
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  
not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh  both human and nonhuman  been scattered in all directions  
we learn some bloody trivia  as well  such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red  it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains  and what it does with halfdigested leftovers  
i suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre  but it doesnt do much for me  
on the surface  and thats about the only level at which this film can be analyzed  deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic  everyone else is citing the equally valid alienstitanic connection  since james cameron directed both   
in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors  deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin  
the film is not humorous  tense  or exciting  
in fact  its downright boring  and  despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ  deep rising feels like the longer movie  
is it really necessary to say anything about the plot  
probably not  since its easy to guess  but ill go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis  
the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship  
in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics  theres finnegan  treat williams   the boats pilot  whos supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff  joey  kevin j  oconnor   the inept sidekick whos supposed to be lovable and funny  but is really just irritating   and hanover  wes studi   the  mastermind   and i use that term lightly  of the operation  
their goal  attack a cruise ship  clean out the safe  then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes  
the problem is  by the time they reach the argonautica  the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste  
aside from a beautiful jewel thief  famke janssen  and a couple of crew members  theres no one on board  
the reason soon becomes obvious  the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles  
the cast  which is led by treat williams  is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes  two exceptions  wes studi  best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans  and djimon hounsou  amistads cinque   
williams  once a  cant miss  prospect in hollywood  has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising  and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career  
famke janssen  who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye  is the perfect bland match for williams  
given her limited acting abilities  its likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes  
unfortunately  a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet teeshirt for half of the picture  
meanwhile  kevin j  oconnor  who has entirely too much screen time  exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard  
these days  audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computergenerated special effects  
this is a lesson that writerdirector stephen sommers  who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book  needs to learn  
the days of jurassic park  when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen  are past  
now  moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic  visuals that are so wellincorporated that its impossible to tell where they end and where  reality  begins  
in deep rising  the monster  like everything  is artificial and unconvincing  
unfortunately  the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isnt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture  but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre  although  to be fair  deep rising is a particularly bad entry   
even once this film has sunk out of sight  the knowledgeable viewer knows it wont be the last of its kind  
like the slimy  slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies  more are waiting just around the corner in ambush  
and that consideration  unlike anything on screen  is truly horrifying
