eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights  
as the movies writer  director  executive producer  and star  murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails  
but at the same time  hell receive all of the credit if it succeeds  
should you sacrifice your hardearned cash to support murphys risky gamble  
well  that depends on whom you trust more  me or eddie murphy  
heres what murphy thinks   i think the audience is expecting a good time  
they gonna get sexy  
they gonna get funny  
they gonna get drama  
they gonna get all of that  
i think its the best movie ive done   paramount radio network   
heres what i think  harlem nights is charmless  unoriginal  disappointing  and almost without question  the worst film of the actors career  i havent seen best defense   
and guess whos to blame   
the movies problem is not murphys direction  harlem nights is a fairly good looking film  
no  the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled  
murphys awful script is the culprit  
lets count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting  
    murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture  
yes  he even outdoes his own work in raw  
practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word  
and after  minutes  it gets irritating  
    murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast  
richard pryor  redd foxx  michael lerner  and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes  
each of them shines occasionally  but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle  
    the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men  
murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life  which is really neither here nor there  
but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on    movie screens across the country  its another matter altogether  
youre forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff  
for instance  murphy punches della reese in the stomach  
and he shoots jasmine guy in the head  
this is a meanspirited movie  folks  
lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore  but only because she doesnt have any scenes with murphy  
thank god  he might have run her over with a bulldozer  
    murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date  
the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film  
murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality  
sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair  
    the plot is a shameless ripoff of the sting  
if youre going to make another sting movie  youve got to do something original  
murphys tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem  circa   fails to add anything new to the formula  
    to get laughs  murphy makes fun of stuttering  
you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped  
    murphys idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life  
for what  
for shooting reeses little toe off  
needless to say  murphy shows little  if any  promise or imagination as a screenwriter  
in all fairness  however  a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie  
danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take  
aiello stands out in the large  ensemble cast  he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character  a racist detective with mob ties   
aiellos zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice  
another bright spot is arsenio hall  who has a hilarious  showstopping cameo as a crybaby gangster  hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy  
in fact  halls ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie  
unfortunately  his character is completely irrelevant to the plot  murphy should have given hall a much bigger role  
of course  ive already mentioned that i didnt care for murphys character  but i have to admit that i did love his neckties  
they are simply spectacularalmost worth the price of admission
