august and september are a wasteland when it comes to childrens films  and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios dont want to see slaughtered against familyoriented thanksgiving films  
last year  the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon  and this year  they bestow max keebles big move on delighted moviegoers across the country  
parents will be thrilled because theyll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesnt smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did  
dont get me wrong  keeble  which is actually only a  ment  away from being a fetish film  isnt that entertaining  
in fact  youd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics  monsters  inc   harry potter  come out next month  
but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy  then youd better do it  because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isnt going to cut it   
we first see young max keeble  alex d  linz  home alone   as a pintsized superhero  delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross  foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man  jamie kennedy  jay and silent bob strike back  and landing the neighborhood honey  brooke anne smith   who  by the way  is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day  
the scenario is  of course  a dream  
max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude  no luck with the ladies and only two friends  both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts  and who were both in snow day   the perpetually robed robe  josh peck  and a clarinetplaying cutie named megan  summer catchs zena grey   who harbors secret feelings for max  
things dont get any better for max when he arrives at school  
he has to contend with  among other things  a redhot science teacher  amber valletta  family man   a pair of polaropposite bullies  noel fisher and orlando brown   and an illiterate principal  larry miller  the princess diaries  whos secretly diverting the schools last dime into the football program  
when maxs father  grownup nerd robert carradine  unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week  max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off  
whoa  dont worry  parents  
he doesnt do it kleboldharris style  
its all pretty tame stuff  but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move  leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings  
director tim hill  muppets from space  adds a few nice touches  like maxs voiceover character introductions for the films main characters and a flashback scene thats pretty funny  but there isnt too much else happening here stylewise    unless 
you count some farting  a little puking  and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk and lil romeo  
    pg for some bullying and crude humor
