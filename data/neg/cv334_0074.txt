im not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick  because im not sure just what the hell  pardon the expression  was going on in it  
however  i can express the most important observation i made of it  i  e  
i didnt like it  
if i had to summarize this film  i think id conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal  
thats the kernel of it  anyway  
tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women  feminism  the role of the devil  modern reformers  and friendship  
unfortunately  little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts  theyre simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace  
actually  i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was  
they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy  on the level of ghostbusters  and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones  
they laughed  or tried to laugh  at moments that were either barely funny  or much more horrible than funny  as if that could bend the film away from its rather frightening direction  
three women  cher  susan sarandon  and michelle pfieffer  live in eastwick  a small midwestern town  
one night  while drinking late into the evening  they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives  
in seeming answer to their idle daydreams  a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be  
he soon shows evidence of mysticalperhaps demonicpower  and his devotion to the womens merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones  
even worse  when ignored his moods become ugly  and he mistreats the women for spurning him  
anyway  the problems  all three female characters are fairly uninteresting  and several are cardboard stereotypes  especially sarandons character  
we never get inside them  never feel sympathetic to them  because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland  
as for nicholson  well  even the devil needs a direction to go in  and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie  due to the grace of the screenwriter and  more importantly  nicholsons acting   he still cant be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague  
and then theres the special effects  
not in themselvesthey werent that goodbut their overuse  
i was almost positive  until i saw the credits  that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind  who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl   because of the big name actors in dopy stunts  or stephen spielberg  after the th vomit scene and the nicholsonblowndownthestreet stunt  
nope  its another bunch of guys  and directed by george miller  who has shown great skill with stuntsspecial effects before  the road warrior   nightmare at    feet  episode of twilight zone  the movie  but apparently doesnt know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act  
fgawds sake  guys  this is jack nicholson  
let him loose  
let him grin demonically  
skip the splitting earth and fake lightning  
watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll  all i could think of was   what a waste   
if youre going to use slapstick like that  use it up on pee wee herman  
nicholson does what he can with the role  and when he can find his bearings  can be extremely good  the scene in the church  for instance   but most of the time  he seems a bit stiff  as if hes not sure what he should be doing next  
and no wonder  
this script goes all over the map  giving you the feeling that itd just love to be allegory  but its not sure about what maybe if you give it time itll think of something  
so what is the witches of eastwick  
a horror movie  
a folk tale  
a comedy  
a statement about women  
an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality  
i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me    watching 
someone regurgitate halfdigested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms  people  the screen  and ultimately  the audience  
in other words  a mess  
      
if you like nicholson enough to watch him here  maybe  of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others
