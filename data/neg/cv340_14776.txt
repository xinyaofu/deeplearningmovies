capsule  liebes meets tod  
this was a film about sex and death  
a morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies  
this film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and death  but imparts no insights  
to make matter worse this print was poorly subtitled into english from french  
   to   
 an attractive yearold dies on a disco floor and gets sent to a morgue  
one of the attendants  ben  jeanmarc barr  is so attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia  
we see him crawling away after a shock  
in the middle of sex the dead teen has come back to life  
 the morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his collection of kinks  
he was already part of a group that gets together for sm sex  
the revived teen  teresa  elodie bouchez  joins them  
 moral dilemma of teresas father  
ben has abused his daughters body  but in doing so has saved her life  
 part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins in the sexual hijinx  
also involved is a man in the final stages of dying of aids  a close friend of the morgue attendant  
he does not get involved in the orgies  
 the subtitles of our print were white  often on a white background making them often hard to read  but i dont think there was a whole lot of meaning there that was lost  
 the title means  dont let me die on a sunday
