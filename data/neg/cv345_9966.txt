movies based on video games  such as street fighter or mario bros   have never generated much interest at the box office  
but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in   it did surprisingly well  
with a simple story  a pulsating soundtrack  and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes  the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy  
it got my vote for the movie where i expected the least and got the most  
and  if you havent had the opportunity  i would definitely recommend that you see it on video  
in the world of mortal kombat  based on the popular arcade game  dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earths realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity  
the mortal kombat refers to a competition  fought by human mortals against outworlds minions  which if won  will guarantee earths safety for another generation  
mk picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition  
despite their victory  however  a gateway has somehow opened  and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth  
outworlds warriors include an impressive collection of fighters  including shao kahn  mintoro  a centaur   sheeva  a fourarmed ogre   and sindel  
earths mortal warriors  under the leadership of the benevolent god  lord rayden  includes liu kang  princess kitana  sonya blade and jax  who must fight against outworlds forces  
its an easy enough premise  but unfortunately  very unfortunately   the writers try to do too much with the movie  
it is only a video game  after all  but the onscreen version tries to go beyond its comic book boundaries by adding depth  a conceptualization of selfworth  and worst of all  a love story  
this becomes very awkward  because all of the players are fighters and nothing more  
they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills  but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act  
this becomes embarrassingly apparent  for example  as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana  
the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best  
they spoke little  but fought a lot  
thus  the movie was easy to digest  
however  mk tries to give these players a certain amount of depth  an element that was lacking in the first movie  but the attempt here fails miserably  
this uneasy feeling is readily apparent  for example  whenever you hear lord rayden speak  
not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic  e  g  
useless  advice  but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom  
try reading this half as fast  and youll hear what i mean  
but the movie is not a complete fatality  
fight scenes are wellchoreographed  highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility  
and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game  although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo  
even if youre not familiar with the video game  each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves  
but its just too little of what moviegoers and especially fans of the game will expect  
oddly  the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence  
and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival  
  i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom   
rent the first one  but the sequel is for kombat fans only
