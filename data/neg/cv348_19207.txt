the happy bastards quick movie review 
wild wild west 
a better name for this movie mightve been  wild wild waste   
warner bros   in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie  had managed to lasso in some big names  actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld  the duo behind mibs success  in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster  a contemporary bigscreen update to the classic westernscifi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad  
but somehow  they ran into a problem along the way  
they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that wouldve made all the difference a story writer  
wild wild wests story and script was compiled by six different people  rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black  ed solomon  
if warner bros  had gotten him  the movie wouldve possibly been five times better than what it is  
heck  ten times  
as is  however  the story and screenplay is a mess  filled with dead laughs  enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as hes performing them  and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well  
heres the story  us army member james west  will smith  teams up with creative genius artemus gordon  kevin kline  to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless  kenneth branagh   whose lower half was blown off during the civil war  leaving him to roll around in a steamcontrolled wheelchair  
they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an foot tarantula  although it looks bigger than that   hellbent on destroying anything in its path  
as i said  the way the script unfolds is a complete mess  
but the acting doesnt help either  
kevin kline is miserable as gordon  failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the  western silverado  
smith seems to be having a better time as west  although hes not nearly as charming as he was in mib  
branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain  perhaps to the point where we cant even stand to look at him or his strange beard  
and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father  but mostly she exists just for sexual attention  
her acting is barely passable  but what a  breath of fresh ass   
director barry sonnenfeld isnt of great help either  
even though he shows some good creativity at some points  his overall urgency for directing is lost  
its as if he feels hes directing a tv movie  a big nono when youre helming whats supposed to be a bigscreen hit  
last but not least  there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable  
at one point  smith defies gravity when first boarding klines train  
he jumps on the back  gets launched straight up in the air  and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while its still in motion  
also  he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob  particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks  
last but not least  why is he still making kissing faces when he knows hes not kissing a woman as hes looking through a peephole at the enemy   
the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects  
the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel  very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show  
theres also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades  but  again  a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity  
i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west  but it really isnt possible  
if the racist and sex jokes dont bother you  the performances will  
if the performances dont bother you  the story will  
if the story doesnt bother you  the racist and sex jokes will  
theres no end to the vicious circle  
go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats  
youll have a better time  
if you do go  keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant  
i bet he wishes he were somewhere else
