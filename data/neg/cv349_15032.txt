old soldiers never die  they just turn into cliches 
soldier a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman 
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
jungian archetypes  these two opposites need each other to create a whole  but its difficult to integrate both  
often well encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and  with the help of jungs magician  sit around imagining grand schemes  
without the drive to manifest their plans  much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness  all they have are dreams  
warriors on the other hand  are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat  and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
they dont care enough about anything to know whats worth fighting for  gladiators who live only for the battle  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know  but can also illustrate societies  
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  
todd   kurt russell  is a living  breathing archetype  
chosen from birth as a soldier  he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
never question authority  
winning is everything  
strength beats knowledge  
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars  todd is  and hes obsolete  
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers  caine   jason scott lee   hes unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia   a garbage world  
obviously our hero is still alive  
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health  
when the peaceloving colonists get a good look at who todd is  they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world  
they are the other good guys  
these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons  
todd finds himself in the role of protector  
what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultraright wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon  
the effects are mostly secondrate explosions or jerky slow motion  
the plot is old hat  
we dont get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  
hardly anything makes sense  
the films science fares badly  
with all the remarkable advances weve made in just  years  the film takes place in    were still stupid  
after conquering the stars  for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away  
even stranger  the garbage barges appear to double as time machines  
virtually all the trash is vintage   
there is nothing in the story that is not predictable  
the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra  connie nielsen   the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him  
it doesnt take a genius to foresee that her husband isnt going to be around much longer  
is it a shock to find out that the films climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine  
who would you guess wins  
some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy  
todds first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connies nipple poking through her thin blouse  
later as he sits by his lonely campfire  a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion  
supposedly this clich  isnt meant to be humorous  
dastardly col  mekum  jason isaacs  with a pencilthin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash  
responsible for last years quirky and visually enticing but problematic  the fifth element   director paul anderson sees the film as  shane  in outer space  
maybe  if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode  
the movie doesnt even work as an action film  
there is never a question as to the outcome  
somehow the new superior soldiers dont prove much of a match for todd  
the acting isnt anything to write home about  
nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim  
russell is buffedup and does a credible job but its not much of a challenge  
uttering around  words during the film  mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space  
gary busey as todds commanding officer is completely wasted in his lowkey role  
everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool  
sometimes the sets are impressive  
unfortunately  occasionally  and  sometimes  dont make a film  
most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote  blade runner   possibly the best science fiction movie ever made  
sharpeyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film  
peoples says that this is not a  blade runner  sequel  but a  sidequel  that takes place in the same universe  
although that may have been the intent in his original script  the result is more like a bad television series that the  blade runner  replicants watch to pass time  
perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining  
  michael redman has written this column for over  years and wants to wish everyone an appropriate halloween    whatever 
youd like it to be
