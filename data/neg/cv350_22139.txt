  what is this  a homicide or a bad bmovie   
that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie  
let me clear things up for you cupcake  this isnt a bad bmovie  its a really bad bmovie  
so bad  its almost good  
almost  but not quite  
the movie starts off in the s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth  
it is a bunch of sluglike creatures that kill people and take over their bodies  
the slugs first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody  
that is  until two loser university students unfreeze him in   
he  and the slugs inside him  promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more coeds into slug zombies  
a slightly crazed cop  tom atkins  and the requisite girl with the face of an angel  jill whitlow  join these two geeky university students  jason lively and steve marshall  to do battle with the slugs  
it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs  
the acting is bad with a capital b  the story is worse  
and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie  
the only saving grace was the requisite titshot courtesy of jill whitlow  
it had absolutely nothing to do with the story  but i liked it  
actually  it was the high point of the movie for me  
of course  that isnt really saying much  
the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion  
which gives it a leg up on some other horror films  
unlike most movies of this genre  there actually is a story  
not a great one  but it is there  
this is one in a long line of movies from the s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the th  halloween and nightmare on elm street movies  
you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better  
but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a bmovie horror marathon  
just dont be too upset if you cant find it  
you really wont be missing that much
