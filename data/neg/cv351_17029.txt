theres a scene early on in  jawbreaker  where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line   that is  so  not funny   
how right she was  
this pathetic tale of three highschoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny  
or fun  
or original  
not content with the tooobvious  heathers  heisting  the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources  including  carrie    bride of frankenstein    blue velvet   and even shaws pygmalion  itself recently remade as  shes all that   
  jawbreaker  is a pastiche  and not even an enjoyable one  
i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence  a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salts  volcano girls   serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film  the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage were watching  
just close your eyes and pretend youre listening to an altrock station  you wont be missing anything  
the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals  
rebecca gayheart  following roles in  scream   and  urban legend   should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie  
pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantinos  jackie brown   
and rose mcgowan should just quit acting  
she has no charisma  no presence  and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected  
mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her reallife boyfriend  rocker marilyn manson  whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the  real  actors are doing  
manson  sans trademark makeup  contact lenses  and with an obviously fake moustache  looks eerily like nicholas cage  who woulda thunk it  
that crack about direction by committee wasnt merely a pithy soundbite  
stylistically  thematically  narratively   jawbreaker  is all over the map  varying wildly in tone  content from scene to scene  
though credited solely to writerdirector darren stein  one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands  
if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity  someone needs to get the man some drugs  pronto  
prozac  lithium  kava  ritalin  something  anything  
hes quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help  
  jawbreaker  is a monumental waste of effort and resources  and quite likely one of the single worst films ive ever seen  
to call  jawbreaker  garbage would be to insult garbage  
bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe  ive already got my pick for worst film of   
  jawbreaker  runs approximately  minutes  though it feels longer than  titanic   and is rated r for language  sexual situations and graphic violence  
not recommended for kids  teens  or anyone else
