the summer of  wasnt a very good one for devout cinephiles  
it offered no blair witches or sixth senses  the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient xmen adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update  
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season  that batterycharging  at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o shit that moseys into multiplexes  time of year when all those oscar contenders  read   quality  films  compete for audiences  
alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season  
its also indie director neil labutes first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture  and im sad to report its a resounding failure  at least on this web site   a mess thats as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labutes previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic  
i went in expecting something decent  for betty was gleefully praised  its screenplay even winning an award at cannes  but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment  
are critics so desperate for something unique that theyre blind to how derivative the particular brand of  uniqueness  betty dolls out is  
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written  and he seems unsure of how to handle the material  
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction  this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men   enchanting like the wizard of oz  of which this film makes several allusions to  and heartwarming like stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie  but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation  
its labutes half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesnt even seem to have half that heart in it  
nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict  betty  brilliantly played by renee zellweger   who witnesses the killing of her husband  del  aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife  by two hit men  morgan freeman and chris rock   
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities  
shes blocked out her husbands death and thinks shes a character in her favorite soap  a reason to love  
betty sets out on the road to la  with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk  searching for her soap boyfriend dr  david ravell  greg kinnear  while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit  
the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men  slipped a bit  but not much  with his sophomore effort  your friends and neighbors  then fell straight on his ass with bash  a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime  
the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist  only labutes persistence in wallowing in the horrid things  average  people do to each other  usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are  
in the play  paul rudd  as an obnoxious jock  delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death  while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim  boys will be boys   
another character  schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby  
what was once so powerful about labutes work  the casual  nonchalant cruelty and selfishness  often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree  had become so over the top it was borderline comic  
obviously  at this point  labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further  but nurse betty isnt it  
he clearly has little passion for what hes doing here  instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks  one of the hit men is a huge soap fan  and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadnt managed to transcend that  tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience  
nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down  as the two are made to enact softboiled tarantinoesque dialogue  
they evince little chemistry  with rock constantly in over the top rant mode  acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man  an occupation thats represented far too frequently in movies nowadays   
i think rock is a great comic yet he hasnt been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies  whenever he acts  and no matter the part  its like hes doing the damn chris rock show  
surprisingly  at least considering her work in me  myself and irene  renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance  building on her baby faced  apple pie looks  
that wideopen face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirtyyearold body  
its the best work shes ever done  
freeman is effective as always  though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it  
the actor plays the role in his usual calm  collected manner  though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and bettys  suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality  
thats interesting but the movie doesnt do anything with it other than crash land the subtheme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle  
the film has good moments  many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear  especially his confrontation with zellweger   an almost soothing  lyrical score  and you know a movies in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it  but nothing jells  its parts  good or bad  are so disparate as to be opposing  
the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film  a mainstream  female forrest gump or an oddball art film  but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke  
bettys screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence  without which betty wouldnt make any progress in the film  
nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter  like how betty becomes a nurse in the film  a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover  she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victims wound because she happened to see how on tv  which leads to her being offered a room with the victims girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear    a little too tidy  dontcha think  
betty has an interesting theme  though it doesnt even seem aware of this  
the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother  with more on the way  
this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality  ironically reallife survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light   
instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze  since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television  albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the s than the s   the film simply uses bettys delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b  no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation
