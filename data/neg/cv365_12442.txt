welcome to your ohso typical sequel  
it tries to be twice as big as its predecessor  yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now theres an idea  
maybe if the illfated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me  was that the camera work  for the opening sequence anyway  was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters  
well  not many of the characters actually  had  characters  but heres a rundown  
annie  who was the highlight of the the original  must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why  
because somethings got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasnt exactly a rocket scientist in speed  here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance  after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases  she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people cant get ut till she gets the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandras character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules  who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric  
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
thats one more tree stump than jason has  
i dont think he changed facial expressions all movie  jason  smile for the cameras   
now frown     i said frown     oh    you are    bang 
bang bang   
wooden just doesnt describe this guys performance  but itll have to do  
the bad guy      ahh    william 
dafoe  theres a bright move  
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic  body of evidence  
  yes  that is sarcasm   
his wide eyed maniac of a character doesnt start out too bad     but 
goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses  
in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage  even though he already has the money and can escape     bang 
bang  
though id like to give this movie a double thumbs down  there were some nice sequences  
considering the movie cost over  million dollars  youd hope thered be at least a couple  
the real eyepopper for me  even though it was given away in the trailer     bang 
bang      was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker  
this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was     completely 
computer generated  
wow     i 
dont think ive ever seen a cg model look so real before  
the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific  and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of     speed  
this lackofspeed problem affects many sequences  
such as the oil tanker part      it was   oh no  were going to hit the oil tanker    
 minutes later   oh no  were going to hit the oil tanker   
 min     you 
get the point  
this movie failed simply because it didnt live up to its name     there 
was very little feeling of speed  
in the original movie  the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive      in this movie it felt more like   well people  were gonna run into that there island in a few hours  i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i cant turn off the engines    im 
passing the cafeteria on the way  can i get anybody anything   
the ending of this movie really is terrible  
even though it features what ive since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie  it just doesnt work at all  
the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic  but     surprise 
surprise  it just takes waaaaay too long  
it seemed to go for  minutes before the ship finally stopped  
one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town  around  people are killed by the ship     and 
theres only  or so people left on the ship  
so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering  the audience is sitting back and thinking   wait a sec    this is a happy moment because   
bang bang 
then there was the dog      i 
almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris  
putting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche       every 
movie seems to have a dogindanger sequence  volcano  dantes peak  independence day  daylight  twister  
lost world       etc  
etc  
this movie is a perfect example of how not to make a sequel  
director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one backtoback and see if he realises where he went wrong
