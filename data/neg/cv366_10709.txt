synopsis  the president of a company wants to test his selfappointed successor  whos psychotic  and thinks its a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall  
comments  tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it  
strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotapes sticker in black marker  not typically a good sign when you rent a film   
strike two came while the previews played  
did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movies quality  or lack thereof  while watching the trailers that come before it  
well  the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows  and they all looked bad  definately not a good sign   
tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout  
about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery  
to be fair  the first halfhour or so promises at least a watchable thriller  
wolf larson  who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant  adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the films title  
james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten  
brolins character  for some inexplicable reason  thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin  practically isolated  with lebrock and larson  whom hes decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company  
by the time the characters arrive at the cabin  this film begins to become tedious  
apparently  brolins successors test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing  which dont seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city  
but  then again  what do i know about business  
i do think  though  that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin  its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch  
larsons character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill  
this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters  which really isnt enough to sustain it  
the films writer must have taken a cue from stephen king  as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and geralds game  
larson and lebrock fight and torture each other  the tables get turned a couple of times  while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help  
some old guys around too  just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple  who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film  
the old guy  however  miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous its worthy of a chuckle or two  
outside of that chuckle  unfortunately  tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors  for some reason  become increasing obnoxious  
if youre in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey  dont  
make tracks to a far superior suspense film  like misery
