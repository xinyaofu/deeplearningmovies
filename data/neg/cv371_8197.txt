first impressions  critically  a closetoawful film  but moneywise  it has been doing  and will continue to do  great  
a sometimesfunny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring  
an orginal plot that grows old real fast  
one of the only  minute films that ive gotten bored through  
men in black has defied the odds  
when i first saw that the flick was  minutes long  i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas  
however  i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas  but the film in  minutes manages to show off a very original idea  which summer audiences have embraced  that becomes old about  minutes into the movie  
tommy lee jones and will smith play two  government  agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society  
the ridiculous plot begins when an alien  bug   played weirdly by vincent donofrio  who was so great in full metal jacket  lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy thats somewhere on  orions belt   
anyway  the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy  or a higher power will blow up the earth  
the premise is ridulous  but that is not why i didnt like this film  
i love original plots  
this one had an original one  
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot  he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films  
whenever i saw donofrios bug stomp and eat people in the film  it got terribly boring after a while  
while smiths wisecracks did fill in the gaps  it wasnt enough  
and also  i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a subplot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent  they cant have contact with any humans really  
and here i see jones  at a satellite computer  watching his lover plant the garden  
a sentimental moment in an alien movie  
nice try  but i dont think so  
it doesnt work here  
it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring  we dont only have aliens to worry about  but now we have joness conscience  
i came into the movie not wanting to see joness conscience  but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it  
maybe its unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were  
nevertheless  even though some parts are indeed funny  the plot in this movie grew old and boring  quick
