there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it  
then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes  
writerdirector john herzfelds two days in the valley falls into the latter category  
weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters  herzfelds tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories  
hitmen lee  james spader  and his partner dosmo  danny aiello  pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox  teri hatcher  lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked  
an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops   jeff daniels  and wes  eric stoltz   
a murder is not vice territory  flirting with asian prostitues is  but wes would rather play inquisitive detective  
meanwhile  washedup director  teddy  paul mazursky  is about to end his life  
but before he can do that  he must find a good home for his dog  
enter nurse audrey  marsha mason   who takes the dog and teddy for a ride  
stuffy art dealer  allan hopper  greg cruttwell  has kidney stones  
while struggling about his fancy house  he switches between moaning in selfpity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretarys  glenne headly  plain appearance  
dont be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on  
you might like that feeling of cluelessness  
herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes  
the jigsaw puzzle assembled isnt stunning by any means though  
the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altmans reallife heroes in short cuts  even though they are interesting and funny  
funny  that is if you arent comparing them to the likes of tarantinos pulp chcaracters  
the tieup is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of  directors name  
guy who also did last seduction  red rock west  
two days isnt a bad movie but there isnt much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters  
itll keep you guessing alright but you wont remember the answers five minutes after the credits  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv broadcast  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
