its actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i  the phantom menace  because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy  
and no  i really dont feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the boxoffice  
really  i dont  
not at all  
the plot has been done before  a mysterious  unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town  causing confusion for everyone who reads it  
the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen  kate capshaw  and by the way  what is it with bookstore owner main characters  
in the past year and a half weve seen them in life is beautiful  youve got mail  this movie  and the upcoming notting hill   who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore  
she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from  and comes to the  incorrect  conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott  
he  reading the letter himself  assumes that she wrote it for him  
after a while  they fall in love  well  duh   
kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her  and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman  tom selleck   
to add to her turmoil  her mother shows up  blythe danner  who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about   and her trusted bookstore manager  deadpan ellen degeneres  quits  
supporting characters arent called supporting for nothing  
their purpose isnt just to move the plot along  theyre also supposed to give the storyline a backbone  
to do this  they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting  
rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed  dull  cardboard secondary characters  especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonists various interactions with them  
this is the love letters damning error  
capshaws character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies  but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely onedimensional  
because of that  the love letter is awkward and insincere  
even worse  its a bore  
i liked capshaw and her helen  but everyone else is painfully fake  undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist  
there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either  and besides degeneres wisecracks  theres little that is even a little amusing  
this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter hosun chan does a good job of portraying helens yearnings and various subtle complexities  
but its far from profound  
there isnt a common theme running through the proceedings  thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless  
really  this is a harmless little movie  its far from an abomination and its not torturous to sit through  
but bad  it is  
awful  it also is  
the love letter is a failure  and an inane failure at that
