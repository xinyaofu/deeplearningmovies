breakdown is an moderately entertaining  if underwhelming  thriller  
kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor  taking the scenic route to california through redneck country  
however  while in the middle of nowhere  their jeep decides to break down  leaving them stranded  
a friendly truck driver  warren  walsh   offers to give them a lift to town  
although jeff rejects the offer  he wants to stay with his car   amy agrees  hops into warrens lorry  and promptly disappears  
jeff wonders where the hell she is  and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life  the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife  
although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance    and the vanishing    plot wise  the latter two are far superior character and script wise  
kurt russell is o  k as jeff  although he can seemingly only pull of one expression  which is angry  
throughout the whole film  he looks angry  or just pissed off   
quinlan is o  k again  but again she can only pull off one expression  which is looking dorky  
throughout the whole film  she looks dorky  
j  t walsh  who  sadly  recently passed away  is fine as warren  who we soon find out is a kidnapper  although his actual character is pretty weak  and not really menacing enough  
the supporting cast do their best aswell  with rex linn as a doubting sheriff  and the other kidnappers  
the story  written by firsttimer jonathan mostow  who also directs  is o  k  if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid  
some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy  
there are some flaws with the plot also  as the characters do the complete opposite to logical  presumably to keep the story exciting  and also the fact that the story just isnt strong enough to sustain the audiences attention  
the picture moves along very slowly also  
it almost threatens to drop dead  
the picture does pick up towards the end  but by then its too late  
mostow directs the action sequences well enough  however  
the film doesnt really come to a satisfying conclusion  either  
the ending tries to be bleak  but just comes off annoying  
breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director  
instead  it just turns out to be merely average  
a missed opportunity
