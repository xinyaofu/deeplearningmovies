synopsis  a man whose lover  paris  was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system  
the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend  laura  and becomes addicted to virtual reality  which  due to a design flaw in his unit  recreates the dead paris  
comments  virtual seduction  executive produced by roger corman and lance h  robbins  serves as a cheaplymade precursor to strange days  a far superior film  
both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are  ab  using technology to be with former lovers  in strange days  the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality   
interestingly  both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium  though strange days uses the setting far more effectively  
this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction  
its not bad for what it is  lowbudget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality  
unfortunately  its been done before and since in much better films  a fact which ultimately leaves the scifi fan bored by this movie  
virtual seduction has many faults  one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins   
the films script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first  but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavyhanded and wooden as the movie progresses  
many important scenes seem too dark  the lighting could have been improved significantly  
the cast  a collection of veteran bmovie actors and sitcom regulars  do only a mediocre job in their roles  
jeff fahey  of the original lawnmower man  convincingly  though unenergetically  plays the lead character  
carrie genzel plays paris  the vr lover  but ami dolenz  as the current love interest  seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality  which doesnt lend credence to the films premise  
meschach taylor  of the once popular designing women sitcom  adequately plays a scientist working on the project  but his performance isnt something to write home about either  
virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background  
in other words  one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then  but its rather boring to just sit and watch  
the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from bmovies in this genre  but it is still an adult rrated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt  
this turkey  ultimately  isnt awful  but its not particularly interesting or unique either  
dont be seduced into watching this movie unless youve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch
