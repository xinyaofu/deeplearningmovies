actually  im fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie  
  baywatch  babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her doubleds on the small screen  
at least there you dont have to pay to see her cleavage  
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless  hate to burst your bubble  but there are no fullfledged nude scenes in barb wire  
you wouldnt be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in  
i cant go back in time and reverse my mistake  but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there  
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude  its so quick you cant even tell for sure whether youre seeing her andersons or not  
a nipple hallucination sort of thing  
barb wire was adapted from a comic book  interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life  even wearing lowcut leather to do office work  businesswoman bondage wear  and having unreal body proportions  
yes  like the mona lisa  pamela anderson is a manmade beauty  probably in more senses than one  
she is a definite beauty  though  and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience  
youd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldnt have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie  because its obvious she wasnt pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills  
i mean  she shows off more cleavage here than a jewelers convention  
the movie is set in the year    the worst year of my life   pam says  
   the worst movie of the year   i say   
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation  silicone valley  i think   
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right  posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute  
but dont call her  babe   
she hates that  and reminds us of that fact way too many times  
imagine  a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist  demeaning term  
a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldnt have to hear words like  babe  during a strip tease  especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success  
the plot  haha  revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorates retina scanners  
in the words of one of the characters  theyre  more than meets the eye   
reminds me of the  transformers  cartoon  and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent  but that never happened  
no  the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela vandamme  bigbusted kickboxer  and her resistance accomplices  exboyfriend axel  tamuera morrison  and cora  victoria rowell   
thank god they didnt name her cora reef  
one bad character name is more than enough  
pamela originally doesnt take sides  giving some speech about shes only loyal to the money they pay her  but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother  jack noseworthy of bon jovi  always  video fame  
i still dont know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy  but he definitely is nose worthy  even if he isnt sponge worthy   
pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semiautomatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest  
its not rambo    
its bimbo  
mark my words  barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year  
its got all the elements of the directtovideo releases featured on hbos bastard cousin  the cable channel id never watch if it didnt somehow come free  
its got the nontitillating scenes of voyeurism  laughable flashbacks  bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo  
theres even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movies premise while the words scroll up the screen  
someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this aint star wars  
if youve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years  youll recognize plenty of lifted elements  
barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over  car crashes  explosions  broken glass and slowmotion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death  
this is one of those automaticpilot movies anyone could write or direct  
barb wire has only two things going for it    
and i think you know what those two things are
