the yettobereleased krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy  but buyer beware  
this movie cant make up its mind  
is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies  menstruation  circumcision  and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them  
or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort  
either way   unbalanced  is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort  
the premise is catchy  widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf  richard dreyfuss  has spent the past two years  getting over  the death of his wife  neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses  
now its time to show what hes achieved in those two years  and he has absolutely nothing to show for it  
with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea  krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous    grant was spent on trips to mcdonalds  
but when his  discovery  becomes the latest craze among colleagues  the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe  he must create it  
with the aid of his three children  the headstrong teen shelly  natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you   the slightly younger mickey  gregory smith   and the nineyearold edmund  carl michael lindner   the  shelmikedmu  tribe  named from the first half of each childs name  is born  and videos quickly produced in krippendorfs backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe  
despite the professors wishes  the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows  due in greatest part to veronica micelli  jenna elfman   an overly vivacious  and voluptuous  anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorfs main assistant  
hungry for recognition  micelli sets up interviews  lectures  etc  in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history  a sure fire way to go down in the history books  
krippendorf  on the other hand  is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor  not in history books  and with each new lecture  he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe  mating habits  domestic structure  etc  thru fumbling improvisation  and often some quick thinking from his oldest son  krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture  but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe  
on the opposing end is krippendorfs arch rival  ruth allen  lily tomlin   an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the nonexistent tribe  
its a cute idea  and approached with a more subtle  and mature  style  krippendorfs tribe couldve been a real winner  
sadly  the mostlymisfired toilet humor  overly comical musical score  by bruce broughton   and sugar coated sentiments  all the key ingredients of a  family comedy   just arent the right tone for this film  
cut that crap out  add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and youve got a good start  
at the state its in now  youve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs  
doubtfire meets dumb  dumber  and thats not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try  
the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of  average   with a few laughoutloud moments and a great big gap in between them  
most of the characters are surprisingly twodimensional  and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort  lyonne  seems to go greatly unappreciated  
director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways  
its stuck in limbo between disney family fare  jungle  jungle  and potentially hilarious adult comedy  a fish called wanda   
its this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade  and its a brutal drop  
a strong warning to parents  forget the impression given by advertisements  do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because shes holding his penis  
yes  its put that bluntly  
just be warned  this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film  and others might not be as tame
