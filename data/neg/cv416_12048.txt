despite its exceedingly welldone visual effects  s original species was one big hunk of scifi cheese  from the writing to the feeble performances  
so  coming from such bgrade roots  its sequels stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising  yet at the same time it is  
it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original  yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad  if not even worse  
something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in speciesa sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alienhuman hybrid silis never entered into  perhaps that was left for species iiithough im not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own   
the alien fun and games begin this time when a threeperson astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain  patrick ross  justin lazard  late of cbss shortlived soap of a few years back  central park westcpw   
this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original films sil  but its close enough  and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy  engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find  
meanwhile  scientist dr  laura baker  the returning marg helgenberger  has created a clone of sil named eve  natasha henstridge again  for research purposes  
it doesnt take long for eve to sense another alien presence  which send her libido into hyperdrive  
its up to laura and her former partner  bounty hunter press lennox  michael madsen  another returnee   and patricks uninfected shipmate dennis gamble  mykelti williamson  to find patrick before the inheat eve does  
  this isnt the xfiles  goddammit   
exclaims one character in the early going  
in terms of quality  hes absolutely right  but hes also wrong  
the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patricks pupils to dilate once hes infected  
looks and sounds an awful lot like the xfiless  black cancer  to me  
but thats not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from  
species was already a ripoff of alien  but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the originals director  roger donaldson  did  
human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself  and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eves alien body  which ironically was designed by alien designer h  r  giger   
a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns  
aliens sans flamethrowers  
the visual effects were by far the best thing about species  and the sequels effects crew at steve johnsons xfx inc  keeps that highquality tradition alive  no cheaplooking lost in space cgi here  
after the effects  the originals best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge  
however  medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment  
at one point shes called on to play alien  empath   la forest whitaker in the original  but for most of the duration shes holed up in a glass cell  
by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place  the film is well into its home stretch  
so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick  played with little zest by lazard  
one problem with the first film was that the deadly  horny  but innocentatheart sil was too sympathetic  no such problem with patrick  who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control  
the rest of the cast also fails to add much  but the writing can be faulted for that  
helgenberger and madsen go through the motions  but they are already hampered by the clich  d development that somewhere between the two films  the oncelinked laura and press stopped getting along  
williamson suffers the worst indignity  
he tries his best to enliven the token africanamerican role  but how can anyone recite insulting  derivative lines such as  im gonna get african on someones ass  and not appear ridiculous  
but species iis worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work  
at least the original featured plenty to laugh atunaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker  and the sight of helgenbergers character performing fellatio on madsens  for a start  
but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all  let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level  
for all the blood and gore  nudity  and sex thrown in  species ii is  quite simply  a vapid bore
