  payback   brian helgelands inauspicious directing debut  coincidentally  he previously penned the awardwinning screenplay for s  l  a  confidential    is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one ideaa movie with nonstop violence  death  and villainsand runs with it  or should i say  barely manages to crawl away with it  
mel gibson  in yet another disappointing picture   conspiracy theory  and  lethal weapon    anyone    stars as the reprehensible villainhero  porter  a man who becomes determined to get his  share of     which he stole in a robbery  back when his partnerincrime  gregg henry  and drugaddicted wife  deborah kara unger  doublecross him  shoot him  and leave him for dead  
porter is not dead  howevernot by a long shotas he quickly rehabilitates and  along with his loyal prositute girlfriend  rosie  maria bello   sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay  
the tagline for  payback  is   get ready to root for the bad guy   and sure enough  this is true  as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way  
i wouldnt have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest  but it wasnt  and therefore  i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever  
no attempt is made to flesh the roles into threedimensional characters  and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them  
just because the protagonist  a  bad guy   is played by mel gibson doesnt mean i will  root for him   and i didnt  
quite the contrary  every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death  although some of them did  anyway  just to spice up the dull proceedings   
since none of the respectable actors in  payback  actually have human beings to play  only one performance managed to stand out  
lucy alexis liu  of t  v  s  ally mcbeal    who plays a spicy sm dominatrix  brightens up every scene she is in  and has a definite flair for comedy  something i would have liked to have seen more of  since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat  
meanwhile  gibson  who is perfectly fine here  sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging  
unger  who made an impression in s  the game   is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in  and only has two purproses     to get high on heroin  and    because she plays a key part in an early flashback  
finally  kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax  and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb  tellingly  he didnt appear in the original cut of the film  but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later   
like most action movies  the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking  
in the course of the minute running time of  payback   porter is shot three times in the back  hit by a van  beaten up  and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer  
and guess what  
not only does he survive the whole ordeal  but he is happygolucky in the penultimate sequence  and can still walk    
even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag  
  payback  is not  in any way  an entertaining film  even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on  but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen  
perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this  so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements  like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours
