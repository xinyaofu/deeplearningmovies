plot  something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and nonhorror movies  
oh yeah  theres also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit  but trust me  you wont care much about the  plot  in this film    
critique  parody movies either work or they dont and this one just doesnt work  
the laughs arent as pronounced this time around  the energy level  the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here  
its like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something  wink  wink   
and the scariest part of it all  
check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy  seven  
i say again  it took seven people to write minutes worth of fart jokes  halfassed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror  
now im not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed  funny sketch  ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves  but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on  saturday night live   
there are a couple of funny oneliners  but mostly just rehashed onejoke scenes  a lot of dead silence and lame gags  
add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here  the films website isnt even up yet    
what the f         
i do however have to give it up to james woods  the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all  the exorcist takeoff miss this and youve missed any reason to see the flick   
i especially liked his oneliner as he walked in to see the possessed womans head turning  
very funny  
unfortunately  the film plummets straight down after that  with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude  wheres my car  and other action movies like charlies angels and mission impossible   now help me figure this one out  will you  
isnt this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies    
  or maybe thats just the title of the film fing with my head   
well  im sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lameass script  
the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers  money  instead of the zucker brothers  comedy  for this sequel  
unfortunately for us  all were left with here is a skeleton of a film which mightve been funny  had it been worked over a few more times  tightened up here and there  and been injected with more solid laughs  
but as things stand now  there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last years film has led everyone down this path  so screw them for not trying as hard  critically speaking  of course   
you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough  real  effort into this chopjob and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents  
pooh on you  
  thats telling em  joblo  
sheesh  
btw  im allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson  whose massive breasts and skanky gstring had me chompin at the bit
