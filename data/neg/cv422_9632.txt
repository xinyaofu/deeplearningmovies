  spawn  may be somewhat of an older film  
in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasnt seen it will finally get to see it  that is  if they see it   
but i managed to catch it before it made its way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and  god forbid  video cassette purchasing  
it wasnt the worst film of year by any means  
it isnt even on the top  of the worst films of the year  
but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten  which  in simpler terms  means it comes in at number  on my  worst of   list  
the only reason it doesnt come in lower is thanks to the special effects  which might actually have been some of the best of the year  
performances  however  were either wooden or  for the most part  unforgivingly campy  
in fact  this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness  
even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality  
i dont know how to explain that one  it wasnt exactly choppy  but something about it seemed  
  
  
well  annoyingly unprofessional  
john leguizamo almost makes it as clown  but not quite  
he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional  
but the main problem i found with  spawn   as with most films that wind up on my  worst of  lists  is that it was just plain boring  
i wouldnt even say there was a climax to the film  
sure  it had the big battle scene at the end  but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion  
never too soon  the movie did conclude in a very simple  disappointing way  
even though its one of the shorter movies ive seen this year  its one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again  
like i said  the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride  no matter how small  
i was impressed with the opening sequence  so long as i didnt allow the melodramatic voiceover and lobotomizing editing to get to me  
and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawns outfit created  
but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes  which looked quite a bit like a modern video game  
who knows if  spawn  the video game  wasnt part of the plan from the beginning  
keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable  and in a very small amount  makes up for the cheeziness of it all  
but none of this movies saving graces can it make it something id recommend seeing  no matter what the price of admission  
this movie is definitely not for young children  which shouldnt really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers  if anyone  would likely find it appealing  
if you really want to catch a movie  there are many better ones out there  no matter what your tastes might be  
trust me  
  spawn  has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers
