the happy bastards quick movie review 
the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid  really  
shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control  
sadly  that is the case with kingpin  a film directed by the farrelly brothers  the duo that brought us theres something about mary and dumb and dumber  
since the duo directed and didnt write the script  i can assume thats part of the problem  
the story seems good enough  a pro bowler in the s by the name of roy munson  woody harrelson  is sitting on top of the world  
his popularity has gone through the roof and hes getting his career off the ground  
then  however  he runs into ed mccracken  bill murray   a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for  well  anything  
these two form an illtimed relationship that involves risky betting  and  before roy sees it coming  eds abandoned him and hes about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine  
forward seventeen years later  where roy has become quite the loser  complete with mechanical hand  tornup car  and  of course  the occasional knocking up of the uglyass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while  
however  he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley  where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael  randy quaid   who has quite the bowling arm  
with the kids help  he figures he can be known again  particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno  nevada  
of course  the amish kid needs some coaxing  particularly when you consider  well  hes amish  
this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film  such as roys process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow  
finally  the duo get on the road and  along the way  pick up an additional helper a beautiful hustler  played by the gorgeous vanessa angel   
the main problem i had with kingpin wasnt the fact it wasnt funny  
in fact  it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it  such as the aformentioned above and roys explanation of not having children  something involving a cheese grater    
but thats just it scenes  
theres a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie  like the abuse angel takes from her hustler exboyfriend  
i mean  was this really necessary  
couldnt have this been handled just a bit wackier  
i mean  this is a comedy  why throw ethics in  
particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle  where hair gel can be easily mistaken  
that really ruined it  however  and thats too bad  
the acting is top notch  especially from angel and murray  and the really funny scenes are worth noting  
still  if youre going to think dumb  think dumb all the way through  ok  
at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or id still be a little bit irked
