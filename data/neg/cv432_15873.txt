robin williams  this time without a beard  returns to drama in this sloppy  sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects  
he plays chris nielsen  who meets annie  annabella sciora  and promptly marries her  
they have two great kids  who sadly die in a car crash  
just when it couldnt get any worse  chris gets killed in a car crash  and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert  gooding jnr   
annie cant take the grief anymore  and kills herself  
  all sounding like good fun so far   
the penalty for suicide is to go to hell  and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller  max von sydow   
based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson  what dreams may come is clunky  manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar  
this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made  
everything is wrong about this movie  the performances are forced  and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters  
williams puts on a convincing upset face  but thats all it is  a face  
theres no emotion behind it  
scioras performance is lazy  and bogs down the whole film  
she may look pretty  but she cant act  
max von sydow is o  k as the traveller  if nothing special  
cuba gooding jnr  thankfully  adds some bounce to his performance  and is certainly the best performer in the film  
its a shame that his character is so flat and d  and offers no room for improvement  
all the performers have to work with a soppy script  that tries its best to get some emotion going  but never takes off the ground  
there are some scenes which could be real heartwarmers  but the faceless characters dont help to get anything out of the performers  
while films like e  t used great actors  music and direction to pull of a masterful hearttugging scene  what dreams may come is haphazard  expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically  
instead  its all rather boring  
sure  the music is pretty  by michael kamen  and the cinematography isnt bad  by eduardo serra  but theres something lacking  
the script doesnt help  filled with hopeless romantic clich  s  and dud speeches  
richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories  sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin  let alone being converted into a  million vehicle for robin williams  
despite being set in heaven  what dreams may come is mightily depressing  
the film rushes a happy ending  but everything before this is very  very sad and black  which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid  
but theres one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie  the special effects  
heaven and hell are truly incredible places  and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets  
but despite this  what dreams may come  proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of   
instead of raising questions about existence  it raises boredom  
sadly  i recommend you give this film a miss  
better luck next time  robin
