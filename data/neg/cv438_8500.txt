retrospective  city of the living dead    
a film review by mike watson copyright  mike watson 
i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as  dimwitted   
and by golly  just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead  
although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career  this is not one of them  
two points in the movies favour  the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi  keep things from falling totally into the abyss  but by and large city of the living dead is a failure  
and like most cinematic failures  it comes down to bad writing  dumb performances and lousy direction  
the story starts in new york when  during a seance  a medium  katherine mccoll  sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich  massachusetts  
for reasons we wont go into here  this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth  
the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance  but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist  christopher george   
that scene in itself is a howler  why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside  
and dont cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before theyre buried  
anyway  off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world  where various grisly goingson are already happening as all saints day approaches  
fulcis graphic gore is in evidence once again  but here it only serves to further highlight the films flimsy script and plodding direction  
the dialogue  in all manner of speaking  is unspeakable  
not bad in the quotable sense  like an ed wood film  but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious  lets explain the plot  type approach  
mccoll doesnt have a clue who her character is  deadly serious one minute  frivolous the next  she at times is genuinely hard to watch  
and the geezer  the actors name escapes me  who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses  
christopher georges performance is salvageable  but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we dont care  
in fact we dont care for anyone in city of the living dead  though in other fulci films that hasnt mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man  as he was in the beyond  
as a director  some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here  
he constantly uses extreme closeups of peoples eyes  a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors arent capable of  
and despite some gruesome violence  he barely manages a single scare in the entire film  
longtime collaborator fabio frizzi  talented but always erratic  offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie  gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electropop thats quite frankly embarrassing  
fulcis other films of this period may be flawed  house by the cemetery  the beyond  the black cat  but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration  atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey  
for completists only
