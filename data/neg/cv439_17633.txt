you know the plot  a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be doublecrossed by a fatal femme  
in  palmetto   the dimwit is harry barber  woody harrelson   a reporter whos just been released from prison  he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating   
enter la femme  rhea malroux  elisabeth shue   the sexy young wife of the richest man in palmetto  florida  rolf hoppe   
she and her stepdaughter odette  chlo  sevigny  have a plot to extort k from the old man  harry will  kidnap  odette  
after groping both women  harry agrees  
as everyone except harry can see  hes being set up as a fall guy  
sure enough  before long  harry has a dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail  
his brotherinlaw  tom wright   an assistant da  has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case  so harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt  and we get to watch him sweatliterally   
there are several plot twists  of coursea couple of them even took me by surprise  
apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog  and theyre on harry like hes the only bone in the kennel  
shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex averys wolf to show up  
her incredible performance in  leaving las vegas  seems to have been a fluke  
here  she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith  
shues character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off as a brainless bimbo  
in addition to shue and sevigny  the kennel includes gina gershon  who filled the dimwitwithashadypast role in  bound   as harrys girlfriend nina  when harry gets out of jail  she licks his face  now theres a horndog   
the parts are so overplayed that with a little push  palmetto  could have been an overthetop parody of film noir a la  romeo is bleeding   
as it is  its best watched at am on showtime  the love scenes seem to have been written for one of that channels soft porn programs anyway   
  palmetto  has a wellknown director  volker schl  ndorff  whos best known for his adaptations of major literary works  especially  the tin drum   
i suppose he must have been drawn to this plotbynumbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake  cape fear   
schl  ndorff tries hardhe makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugsbut nothing can freshen up this stale script
