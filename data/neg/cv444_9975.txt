the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation  batman and robin  
both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts  but also their monosyllabic dialogue and emptyheaded character motivations  
in panelsized morsels  implausible plots and  rambo  esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork  but on thirty foot silver screens  its much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures  
spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons  white  who is framed by a corporate baddie  played without irony by sheen   then set on fire and left for dead  
though the movie skimps on the next few plot points  heres what i could determine  said assassin then becomes the leader of satans army  under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown  leguizamo  grating as always   
he is renamed  for reasons unbeknownst  spawn  and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon  
but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child  he realizes that he cant be the evil superdemon hes expected to be  and he sets about avenging his untimely death  
typical of summer blockbusters  spawn is an effectsladen ninety minute rock video  
while the visions of hell are laughably crude  think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man   spawns prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold  
but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion  spawn longs for his wife  but they dont have a single scene together before simmons death    conflict  who will triumph is not anybodys guess   and believability  not that i expected it   
so many questions are left unanswered  and im sure they wont be addressed in the inevitable sequel  
while last years the crow  city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative  which was lazy and somewhat incoherent   it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power  
spawn is an inyourface  screaming banshee of a film  these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid  but they havent the faintest idea how to make a movie
