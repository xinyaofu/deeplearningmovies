the people who populate the movie  are shallow  selfabsorbed and selfindulgent  
in other words  they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts  
 is the story of that wellpublicized new york disco  studio   the inplace in the s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled  photographed and pampered  
the difficulty with   which was written and directed by mark christopher  is that his script takes no point of view  
christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio s hallmark  
he keeps an uninvolved distance  thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists  
the movies one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell  the famous owner of the nightspot  
he is part rebel  part dreamer  part shrewd entrepreneur  
hes smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele  yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs  
myers  in his first straight character part  is in turn appealing and appalling  
at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation  then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash  
the story is told by shane oshea  ryan phillippe   a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple  
shades of john travoltas brooklynbound tony in saturday night fever  
eventually  shane does come to new york  attracts rubells eye and is admitted to the promised land  
his looks get him a job as a busboy  and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender  where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous  
shanes dream is to meet soap star julie black  neve campbell   a fellow garden stater  
but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up  its no big deal  
the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent  
 is a very cold  uninvolving movie  
its all strobe lights and glitz  all substance  
its sort of like the musical era it covers
