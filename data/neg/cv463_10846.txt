synopsis  melissa  a mentallydisturbed woman who likes to smoke  seduces doug  a minorleague baseball player who likes to study anatomy  work on motorcycles  and make out with his girlfriend in a public library  
when doug decides to stop seeing her  melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him  including his girlfriend  his mother  and his cat  
comments  malicious  i suppose  is an acceptable moview for what it is  a cheap  bmovie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurnedpsycholoverwhowantsrevenge films  like fatal attraction  hand that rocks the cradle  etc  etc   that have come before it  
malicious  however  really doesnt provide very many particularly suspenseful moments  
the plot starts off energetically enough  the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film  
it starts to drag  unfortunately  after this  
melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug  as always seems to happen in movies like these   but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other  better thrillers before  
she drugs someone  
she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriends apartment  
and  of course  she stalks  so we see a number of shots  which are supposed to be suspenseful  where shes spying on doug and his girlfriend  
i wont reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey  but i warn you that its both painfully obvious and a real yawner  
john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the notsobright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa  one of the scripts faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a premed student   
the same cannot be said  though  for molly ringwald  
at times  she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine  especially during her silent  imgoingtostareyoudown scenes  
at other times  however  she just seems somehow goofy and out of place  
in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful  she screeches  fk you  you bd  and throws a phone  
she delivers the line so ridiculously that one cant help but laugh  
malicious certainly isnt the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks  a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there   but it isnt all that good or original either  
feel free to treat this film maliciously  watch something else
