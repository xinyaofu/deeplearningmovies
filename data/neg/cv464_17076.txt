review by  geoff berkshire 
im not an overly cynical guy  
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years  
however  i have my limits and i also have standards  
this brings us to the subject at hand  message in a bottle  the big ticket romance that warner brothers unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentines day  
the story  what little of it that there is  involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne  robin wrightpenn  dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason  jesse james   
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean  
the letter  written to a mystery woman named catherine  instantly captivates her  
upon her return  theresa shares it with her best friend lina  illeana douglas   her boss charlie  robbie coltrane   and the entire city of chicago  the newspaper publishes an article about it   
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake  kevin costner  and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down  
he turns out to have a colorful father  paul newman  but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing  
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship  
of course she doesnt tell him that she found his letter  she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later  preferably right after they first make love   
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened  
the discovery of the message and garrets discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film  
theres a truly lame subplot about garrets relationship with his dead wifes family  he gets into a bar fight with her brother  played by john savage  and then the necessary tearjerking ending  
a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die  although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel  
the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced  and unintentionally humorous  sequences filmed since    
well  since costners the postman     
message in a bottle is one slow moving film  
last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this  
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work  
message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but theyre fighting the material all the way  and losing badly  
costner and  especially  wrightpenn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring  
they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry  
the supporting players are given very little to do  
the reliable douglas is particularly wasted  
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film  
a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played  
however  too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are  
the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story  
gabriel yared  who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient    and city of angels    with his scores  overdoes it a bit here  
caleb deschanels camera makes everything look a little too beautiful  
do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly  
the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times  
the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego  
working from a best selling novel by nicholas sparks  which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county   di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times  
its strict adherence to clich  s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer     
there simply isnt an original scene in this film  
the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking  
this is director mandokis first film since when a man loves a woman     the solid meg ryanandy garcia romance  
hes simply going through the motions with this  
message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come    as one of the most misguided romances of the decade
