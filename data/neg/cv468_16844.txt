the  fab   of ronald reagan high are four stuckup girls  played by rose mcgowan  rebecca gayheart  julie benz and charlotte roldan  who overdress like  posh spice wannabes  
their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty  and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their makeup and powder their cheeks  
under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public  
in writer and director darren steins jawbreaker  it isnt as funny as it sounds  
in fact  it isnt funny at all  
stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence  wit or charm  
his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they dont have time to add any emotion  
and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains  
the setup for the movie has one of the fab   liz  who is referred to as  the princess di of reagan high   be killed when a prank by the other  goes wrong  
the princess di reference is in bad taste  as is much of the movie  
granted  bad taste can sometimes be funny  but the mere presence of bad taste doesnt guarantee it  
lizs girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth  tape her mouth shut  and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car  
when they open the trunk later  liz is dead  
they eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape  
these realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead  seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer  
the films dialog not only isnt funny  its trite  
one nerdy young girl introduces herself with  my name is fern mayo  as in hold the mayo   
when fern discovers what has happened  the fab  make her an offer she cant refuse  makeup  
they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan  
the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah  
the teachers fare no better  especially in the ridiculous lines they are given  
  miss shayne  please cover your bosom   one young teacher  who has been made up to look old and ugly  says without any conviction  
  this is a learning institution  not a brothel   
besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made  there is one other question that id like to ask the director  
why do you have a phone number start with  if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway  
in a cameo  pam grier plays detective vera cruz  who investigates lizs murder  
as she interrogates the other people  she stares at them like they are all idiots  proving that she is the only one that gets it  
i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie  shed walk out after about  minutes  and youd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it  
jawbreaker runs     
it is rated r for violence  gore  profanity and sex  
i would advise everyone to avoid it  but if teenagers go they should be older and mature
