hollywood never fails to astound me  
every time i think those cokedup little buggers have hit rock bottom  they come up with a new excavating tool  
i was truly convinced that  wild wild west  marked  studio filmmaking at its most hapless  but then along comes  end of days  to prove me wrong  
this big budget  brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music  grisly violence  explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects  
the result  
nothing but groans and yawns  
even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept  
at the very least   end of days  should have done us the courtesy of being badenoughtobegood  but it cant even manage that  
its just lousy  
arnold schwarzenegger  still recovering from heart problems and  batman  robin   plays an excop turned security agent or bodyguard or something  
along with his obligatory comic relief partner  kevin pollak  impersonating matthew perrys chandler character from  friends    he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo  
it seems that satan  gabriel byrne  gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years  and here i thought hed pulled it off with the republican landslide of    
if he has sex with year old christine york  robin tunney    the chosen one   their child will be the antichrist  or at least a brat  
ah  but this deal has more catches than a new years eve pass from a halfway house  
the unholy union must take place on december     you see   is just  turned upside down   but only between  p  m  and midnight  no wonder this guy is so cranky   
and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church  the devil wont know where she is  because he cant see into the sanctuary  
you know  its kind of like supermans xray vision and lead walls  only evil  
a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl  
arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan  if youll pardon the expression  
and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own  
oh  the anguish  
oh  the humanity  
oh  the writing  
andrew w  marlowes screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility  from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane  schwarzeneggers character  
cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first  lethal weapon   preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter  
twenty minutes later  hes racing through the bowels of new york city  deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling  
when cane meets up with christine york  he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode  with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter  
in case anyone misses the connection  the camera comes in for a close up of christines music box  which just happens to be identical to one owned by canes daughter  
subtle  marlowe  subtle  
speaking of cameras  director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowes script and make it even more selfimportant  murky and annoying  
hyams direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video  with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces  punctuated with loads of big explosions  
eager to satisfy arnolds core audience  he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well  
what a guy  
had the film delivered some decent scares  or even maintained a consistently ominous tone  the bombastic clich  s might have been tolerable  but  end of days  is simply a flaccid special effects show  
the cast is just as ineffective  
in his early scenes  gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache  but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster  
kevin pollak comes and goes quickly  robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold  well  hes a better actor than casper van dien  
that should count for something  
way back in the aftermath  the exorcist  and  the omen   supernatural swill like  end of days  might have passed muster as a bmovie  
but that was then and this is now  
  the xfiles  and  buffy the vampire slayer  deliver real scares on a weekly basis and  if we want to see the devil  all we have to do is flip on  the  club  and take a gander at pat robertsons grinning maw  
after enduring  end of days   all i can say is  get thee behind me  satan  
and while youre at it  get thee a better agent as well
