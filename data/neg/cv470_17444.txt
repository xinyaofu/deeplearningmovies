i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series  
if theres a will  theres a way  and i believe that anything  no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon  
this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sants universally panned update of psycho  i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience  but also very onpar with an original  
but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad  
you see  the point of a remake is  or at least it should be  to iron out the originals flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection  
but what if the source material on which the remake is based isnt any good to begin with  
that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad  
ive only seen a couple episodes of the late s tv series on which it is based  and to be honest  i didnt like it all that much  
it has a concept that  and still is  interesting  a group of corrupt young adults  all in their early s are given a choice  they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed  or they can become undercover cops  helping the police get into places that they normally wouldnt be able to access  
obviously  all  opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen  and policewomen   
the three main characters here are played by claire danes  omar epps and giovanni ribisi  
of the three  only danes has a real character  
ribisis dumbass  year old is played exclusively for laughs  epps slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes  
when the squads superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death  the three of them  sure that their beloved master was framed  go off and investigate on their own  discovering corrupt cops  lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations  
all kinds of good stuff  
the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments  
although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie  his man here is really rather amusing  when the script gives him a chance  
epps straight man is effectively played against ribisis clueless spontaneity  
but the rest of the film is dull  boring and singularly uninteresting  
a drugop action plot is no longer anything new  not even with teenage action heroes  and the way its executed here  its also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful  
claire danes character has potential  but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained  
she could have been a tourdeforce  but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role  
epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected  although their characters arent nearly as rich as danes could have been  
the mod squad is a mindnumbing marketing plot of a film  and teens will jump all over it  
its full of bad dialogue  scenes and concepts that make no sense and  get this  drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time  
nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for  
claire danes is no longer alluring  mainly because shes got a horrible hairdo  so that draw is out  
there are  however  cool explosions  guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort  
do not be fooled  
some may call this escapist fare  i call it escapeasquicklyasyoucan fare
