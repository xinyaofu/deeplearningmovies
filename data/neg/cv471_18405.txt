when the mediums in question are video game and feature film  has there ever been a respective heretothere transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodleheaded mediocrity  
  super mario bros     street fighter  and  mortal kombat  were silly stinkers all  and now the empty  execrable  wing commander  joins their lowly ranks  
enduring this spectacularly bad bit of scifi  easily the worst of its kind  is like watching someone futz around with a video game for  minutes  that is to say  theres little fun to be had when youre not the one holding the joystick  
the movie  then  is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts  who created the original  groundbreaking pc incarnation of  wing commander  back in   
how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a headscratcher  
  wing commander  s story  credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney  is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas  
it rips off the finest films of its genre  top gun and  in one scene  even those spiffy  stereoscopic freeze  gap commercials  
set in    wing commander  stars freddie prinze jr  as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him  
along the way  he plays kissyface with his stoic superior  saffron burrows  at the new galaxy hangout where hes posted  comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his  pilgrim  heritage  dont ask   and goes on a topsecret mission involving the  jump coordinates   what  no death star plans   of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi  
or something like that  
given the immensely confusing activity  its hard to tell  
on the other hand  whats easy to see is that  wing commander  is a big old mess  
the lame dialogue strains  filled with such original lines as  dont you die on me    
  battle stations   
and repeated  and frequently unanswered  calls for a  medic   
action sequences fizzle  
the character conflict garners unintentional giggles  
the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like  as theyre kept out of view until the concluding  minutes  
imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a  s roger corman cheapie and youve got a good idea  
little but technobabble happens for an hour  and then its as if  wing commander  tries to do too much at once  when it appears as though the movies about to show signs of a pulse  it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before  
matthew lillard  featured prominently in said sequence  is cast as prinzes hotshot partner  and though the two are fine young actors  recently paired in the hit  shes all that   theyre fighting more than otherworldly evil here  
rumor has it that  wing commander  was slated as a laterintheyear release  bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new  star wars  episode i  trailer  
but in my audience  there were no females present to make googoo eyes at prinze or lillard  and many a member exited after the muchballyhooed sneak peek  
since most cineplexes wont be granting refunds to the latter contingency   commander  might rake in some dough  but be warned  the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation
