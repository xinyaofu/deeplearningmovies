its almost amusing to watch year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potters followup to s the tango lesson  the man who cried  
the geny actress  with her cold stare and big  black eyes  has appeared in an impressive range of films  but she doesnt even come close to being the bold heroine the film  set against the historical backdrop of world war   requires her to be  
ricci  whose character is shockingly silent and blank  showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern  shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett  quite an amusing sight to behold  
blanchetts lola  a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie  is bold  interesting and layered  everything our heroine lacks  
costar of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy  blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci  sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe  
the actress inhabits the role  as she always so remarkably does  with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the films lead rather than her dull companion  
important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film  these landmarks serve as the films little conflict  
obviously  the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events  whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues  
the man who cried has many aspirations  none of which come full circle by the films close  
there are forced messages here and there   go forward  always go forward   lola preaches to suzie  theres romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitlers nazis  the gypsy cesar  johnny depp  who  like ricci  barely gets to speak   lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it  and at the core of all these devices lies suzies desire to travel to america  where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago  
the films main problem is that potter isnt skilled enough to tell the epicsized story of suzie  
the time periods instability  the conflicting social classes  the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life  serving as both writer and director  potter throws in some of each  but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any  
by the time the sighinducing climax hits  the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater  
the films falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely  are we really meant to believe any of this could happen  
contrastingly  in its moving final scene  the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film  
although its apparent that potter cant grasp what she reaches  im puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place  
riccis suzie is meant to be the films core  from the extended flashback at the films beginning to the quickly drawn ending  everything seen in the film  in some way  relates to her  
so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals  
the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble  but not present enough for the film to be riccis  
the almost constant lack of flow and onenote tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha viernys beautiful cinematography that renders the films various locations wonderfully  
also worthy of note are lindy hemmings costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely  
and then theres the music  
from minute one to minute ninetyseven  theres hardly a moment when the wavering  skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music dont undercut the action  the notes stricken both overwhelm  particularly john turturro  portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio  whose money and reputation catch lolas interest  and accompany  oftentimes  the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the films characters and reinforce that state   
potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note  unfortunately  the same effort isnt given towards  almost  everything else
