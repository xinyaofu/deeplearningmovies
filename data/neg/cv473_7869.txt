sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw  
yup  its gotta be summer  
just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and directtovideo releases  into port slams speed   cruise control  the gloriously godawful followup to the  sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed  
the gimmick  this time  is an ocean liner rigged to  well  crash into stuff  
sound exciting  
dennis hoppers disgruntled bomb squader  the villain of the first film  has given way to willem dafoes disgruntled computer programmer  a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches  i kid you not  as a selftreatment for copper poison ing  
  and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro magnetic fields  no less  
calling dean edell     
so  he overrides the boats computer  convinces the crew to abandon ship  and sends the remaining passengers  those who couldnt evacuate in time  on a col lision course with destiny  
  oddly  no one thinks to just    
jump off the back of the boat   
with keanu reeves electing not to return perhaps he read the script   
the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric  sleepers   as the  second  la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin babe annie  bullock  has dated  
  what are the odds   
theyre on this caribbean cruise for pleasure  as are a handful of requisite stock characters  including a deaf teenager    who has a crush on the hero     who also knows how to sign       
  and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move  
wait till you see the feats that  this  little girl can do  when stuck on a shipboard elevator   
bullock is her pesky  perky self  though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests  
  those paying attention to her bikini and tank tops probably wont complain  however  patric is the main man in motion and thats damn good  cause when he stops to talk  hes only slightly less monotone than his predecessor  
  his first lol line is to ms  bullock   id like to boogie with you    
of course  nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does  
he also produced this mess  which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards  
  con air  buddy  fathers day  romy and michelles high school reunion  murder at    heads in a duffle bag  anaconda  vegas vacation  meet wally sparks  metro  bevery hills ninja  the relic  all is forgiven   
worse  hes spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesnt even live up to its title  
theres no sweatinducing motion of the ocean here just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of crosscut exteriors  all leading up to the big slam  when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town  
  oh  how far weve come in twenty years  
remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak   
admittedly  either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission  
its just the rest of the movie the other hundred or so minutes thats pure nonsense  
and wonderful nonsense at that  
i know he didnt intend to  but de bont has done one thing right  hes created the handsdown funniest film of the year  
so  now  allow to present a few more things that made me laugh  
o a box with a big label   fiber optic converter  
o plain english  wholesentence computer instructions 
o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door 
o jason patrics character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything thats happening 
o a ships navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say  i canna override it   
o willem dafoes amazing armmounted keyboard 
o two living  breathing adults  bullocks character and the first mate  who have to be told  step by step  how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade  
duh 
o  no wait   
screams the ships intercom 
o yet another damn dog in peril 
o fishing reel  
pontoon plane  
memories of weekend at bernies
