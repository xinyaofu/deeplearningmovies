miramax  disinvited  online media from press screenings of scream   
they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoilerfilled reviews and post them prior to the films february th release dateunsound reasoning  
you see  net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionalsmiramax surely knows the difference between a member of the online film critics society  ofcs  and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at aint it cool news  
no  the  mini major was afraid wed let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit  that scream  is a dismal conclusion to the beloved  by this writer  at least  franchise  
something smells rotten in the state of california right from the getgo  cotton weary  liev schrieber   the former lover and wouldbe killer of maureen prescott  sidneys mother  is juggling phone calls in his luxury car  
  once considered a danger to society  weary now hosts his own talk show    cotton   a clever  if dated  jab at american pop culture   
of course  a new ghostface dials him up  and  with memories of screams unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind  we immediately wonder  where is the killer  
the backseat  
the next car  
thrilling prospects  to be sure  but actually  ghostface is at the weary residence  waiting for cottons girlfriend  kelly rutheford  to finishing showering  
whats missing from this sequence  and indeed scream s remaining frights  most disappointingly  the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes  one of which might spring to life   is an elaborate and attenuated payoff  
our other surviving regulars have become estranged  
sidney  campbell  is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and passwordprotected locks  while dewey  arquette  acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream s moviewithinamovie   stab    and gale weathers  cox arquette  headlines a gossipy news program  
murder reunites them  as knifewielding ghostface stalks the set of  stab    imitating its sadistic screenplayand hishertheir own personal draft climaxes with sidneys death  
the appeal of ghostfaces villainy is that heshethey could be your boyfriend  your classmate  your next door neighbour    or a combination of people  
scream was the first of its kind  a slasher mystery  with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next  but also who isare the perpetrator  s  and what isare hishertheir motive  
ironic selfreflection aside  parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the th and halloween flicks because theres at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume  
with scream   the novelty of ghostfaces evermutating identity has worn off some  but the character remains conceptually potent  
conceptually  the execution of ghostfaces master plan this time around is creaky  because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what wed come to understand in scream and scream   the movie gets in the silly habit of saying  all bets are off   
in reference to the  rules  of a trilogys third act  but theres a difference between rule breaking and cheating  
with the departure of kevin williamson  who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream   that  for reasons incomprehensible to me  was ignored  save the notion of  stab     kruger needed to be reined in tighter  and by wes craven  
cravens direction of scream  is lazy in most respects  
how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo  the slacker duo of kevin smith movies   akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny  
it pains me to write this  but scream s comedy is generally laughless  with the exception of welltimed performances by josh pais  as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in cravens music of the heart   jamie kennedy  resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream    and parker posey  through sheer force of will as a bactress   
the visuals are much weaker in part three  as wellthe occasional sweeping gesture of peter demings camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before  
  aside  in the wake of columbine  craven toned down the violence significantly for scream why the sanctimony  when scream and scream  are still readily available on video store shelves   
finally  marco beltramis music cues the suspense too blatantlydo you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream   its mostly silent  
sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere  here  they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nervejangling score  
i look at scream  as coming from an alternative universe  the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iiiwoefully out of synch with its prequels  scream  is a nightmare instead of nightmarish  and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs  
the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t   part three must disappoint
