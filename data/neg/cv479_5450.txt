i have a great idea for a movie  one that cant miss  
see  ive got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack  and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances  
its about professional basketball  so ill release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity  
as for what the movie is actually about    well  that will all sort itself out eventually  
i figure it will be a comedy  so ill throw a halfdozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with  
maybe well put a gender spin on it  see if we can get some women out to see it  too  
eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind  
twister  as inane as the script might have been  at least required some creative technicians  mission  impossible  overwrought plot and all  at least involved genuine effort  
eddie just sits there  hawking up a formula story without any laughs  and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required  
whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin  a new york limo driver and diehard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team  
coach john bailey  dennis farina  has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas  and the losses are beginning to mount  
the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess  frank langella  to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team  
the winner  surprise  surprise  is eddie  who becomes a fan favorite  and eventually the actual coach  
the knicks continue to lose  but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops  
incidentally  the knicks eventually start winning  
please raise your hand if that comes as a shock  and i will invite you to my allnight marathon of the bad news bears  major league  angels in the outfield  the mighty ducks  the big green  cool runnings and little giants  
awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds  its what they do  
those teams usually involve kids  for a very sound comedic reason  its funnier when they screw up  and theyre more sympathetic  
those which dont involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles  for another very sound comedic reason  they generally have developed some sort of comic timing  
eddie was cast under the misguided premise that its easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players  
this finds nba players like greg ostertag  dwayne schintzius  rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper  though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players   
perhaps that all didnt matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines  and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick  
steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming   dont blame me  i just work here   
perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isnt a movie  its a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while  
among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump  new york mayor rudolph giulianni  former new york mayor ed koch  david letterman  letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam  espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert  as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas  
and those are the real jokes in eddie  
nothing these individuals say or do is funny  you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice   hey  its donald trump   
or  hey  its mujibur and sirajul   
its difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it cant even get the cliches in a clicheridden genre script right  
the knicks coach who is eddies antagonist early in the film reappears at the end  but he isnt given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs  
neither is frank langella  and none of the athleteactors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of  
that leaves her to do her streetwise miss thang routine  but with no character  no sharp lines and no help  
eddie isnt just a bad movie with a formulaic premise  
its a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended  because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie  and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy
