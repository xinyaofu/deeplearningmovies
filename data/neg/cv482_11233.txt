even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor  his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality  
like everyone else  dreyfuss has bills to pay  so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies  
consequently  while his career highlights include jaws  close encounters of the third kind  stakeout  and tin men  his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador  let it ride  and now krippendorfs tribe  
let me start out by saying that krippendorfs tribe is occasionally funny  although never riotously so   but thats about its only asset  
the best word to describe this film is  asinine   
the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes  which are aimed at someone going through puberty  
krippendorfs tribe tries to be a zany  offthewall comedy  but the film makers have forgotten three important rules  
the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist  
the second is that viewers should be able to identify with  or at least care about  a character or two  
finally  and most importantly  more than  of the jokes have to work  
once upon a time  james krippendorf  dreyfuss  was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college  
he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a  lost tribe  somewhere in the wilds of new guinea  a goal which they never accomplished  
shortly after their return from the failed trip  krippendorfs wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children  shelly  natasha lyonne   mickey  gregory smith   and edmund  carl michael linder   on his own  
now  over a year later  the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf  which he has spent not on research  but on things for his family   so they send a new member of their faculty  professor veronica micelli  jenna elfman   to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings  
when he arrives at the college for the momentous event  rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds  he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe  the  shelmikedmu   
to provide video footage  he films his children dressed in native garb  
soon  much to krippendorfs surprise  the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon  
but one disaffected professor  lily tomlin  is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud  
the only way krippendorfs tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters  not to mention the viewers  are dumber than dirt  
unfortunately  its impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this  
director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags  
meanwhile  attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture  i  e   how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend  come across as feeble and derivative  
the acting in underwhelming  
dreyfuss has definitely not given his  all  to the role of james krippendorf  
alongside him  jenna elfman  the spunky costar of tvs dharma and greg  radiates perkiness and little else  
this quality  while fine for a minute television program  quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a featurelength movie  
no one in the supporting cast  lily tomlin  david ogden stiers  natasha lyonne  woody allens daughter in everyone says i love you   excels  
i know that a movies in trouble when its half the length of titanic  but seems much longer  
most of what comes on screen is generic sitcom level material  the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set  
if theres any upside  its that i dont see much boxoffice support developing for this lame  illmarketed miscue  
krippendorfs tribe will quickly become extinct
