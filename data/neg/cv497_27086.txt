this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard  
the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend    ned 
kelly  the socalled robin hood of the aussies  
but he fails to be convincing  in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly  
the film opens to a bw prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution  
then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback  coming home from jail after a year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family  
this scene is set in   
in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings  as he sings shel silversteins lyrics  which tells  of neds hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic  
ned says a debt must be paid    
as he hears voices from his dead father  his classdivided country  and his conscience  all telling him to get revenge  
so begins neds romp through australias outback  seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered  
he begins by stealing horses  after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray  which favors the rich landowners  
when hes only  he forms a gang  causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police  who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds  
when neds mother  clarissa kaye  is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to  years  ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mothers freedom  
when the authorities refuse  the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage  burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers  
rampaging through the outback  they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes  who dont trust the traps  police   
spoiler to follow in the next paragraph  
in the climax  kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police  but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured  
neds brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive  
but kellys gang escapes  as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers  as they become decoys  
this was a flat presentation  hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kellys call for justice  
jagger didnt have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson  
the story failed to focus on australia  seemingly a more british film than australian  
under richardsons lackluster direction  all jagger seemed to do  was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge  which soon became a shrill cry  
if you want to see a better film about ned kelly  catch  mad dog morgan      a much truer and more daring version  with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kellys madness  something this film could only do in a hohum manner
