i think we should  as responsible citizens  all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie  
hes changing the cinema as we know itand for the worst  
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic momentsprologues  epilogues  etc  the premise  a lawyer cant lie for a day  
ho  ho  
normally a movie made from this premise would be terriblemr  
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable  
i laughed onceand i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing  
grinding doesnt begin to describe  
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that  if you are a normal person  you leave feeling sick  
when its not trying to be funny  its trying to be melodramaticbut its just annoying  stupid and sappy  
at best  
this movie is intended to make people laugh  yes  not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound  
but  it fails on every possible level  
it fails to be funny  
it fails to be insightful  
it fails to be suspensful  
it fails to be fun  
they should pay people to see it  
it suceeds on one levelit makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles  for having lived  
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive  please make sure that you are overly fond of boob  fart  pimple and fat jokesotherwise you will go insane  
yes  literally insane  
stark  raving mad  
it is boring  stupid  melodramatic and in the end ugly  
i reccemond it strongly  
to ed wood
