the best thing  in fact  the only good thing  i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l  a  confidential again  
or go rent body heat  to see william hurt do some real noir  
or even  god help me  palmetto  
alex proyass new movie screams atmosphere  
i screamed  too   get me out of this theater   
new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors  and doesnt have any way to get it back  
i paid    for a matinee screening and dont have any way to get my money back  either  
youll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie  
i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning  nightmarish future world where its always a late night in   complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras  
ive got news for you fellows  i dont care how hard you worked  or how visually stunning this movie looks  you wasted your time and mine  working on a movie without a plot  without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go  without a soul or a reason to care  
the movie starts out ohsopromising  
john murdoch  rufus sewell  is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life  would have been boarded up long ago  
there is a dead  mutilated prostitute in the other room  a surprise  as he has lost his memory  
the phone rings  its a sinistersounding man  claiming to be his doctor  telling him to flee for his life  
all well and good  right  
wrong  
apparently  someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot  
  this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood   
so  the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life  rather  its a voiceover narration by the aforementioned doctor  keifer sutherland  explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible  
its as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca  
no  wait  thats not fair to casablanca  
its more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show  or if you want to know how i really feel  having an offscreen narrator explain that gilligan wont be getting off the island in this episode  
from here  the coherence of the plot goes down faster than  insert monica lewinsky joke here   
the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason  and thats what moves the plot  
what were left with is a string of unanswered questions that dont make any sense  
were given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers  yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed  
were given a hero who can  tune  into these same powers  yet he only uses them when its convenient to the plot  
were given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere 
usually  critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part  isnt given much to do   
in this movie  no one is given anything to do  
sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesnt remember anything  and plays it like    
um    
a man who doesnt remember anything  
the aliens are tall  pastyfaced  and bald  and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that theyre evil  and theres a child alien as well  straight out of an anne rice novel  
sutherland is saddled with a limp  a twitchy eye  and a breathy accent to remind us that hes in league with the aliens  
to its credit  dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting  
william hurt is perfectly cast as the worldweary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city  
jennifer connelly  playing sewells love interest  is given two alltoobrief moments on screen as a lounge singer  and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit  
but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script  the way they would be in any selfrespecting noir movie  theyre almost tangiential to the plot  such as it is  
the problem with dark city is this  its a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir  
the essence of film noir isnt  as proyas seems to beleive  breathy dialogue or snapbrim fedoras or tall  bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner  
dark city has not one bit of intrigue  moral ambiguity  suspense  or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics  
dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic  
its an exceptionlly wellmade and intricately designed piece of flotsam  sailing around and around the middle of the ocean  going nowhere
