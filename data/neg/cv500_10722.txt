you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year  
theyre obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes  having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big boxoffice holiday season   
combine that with howie longs first starring action role  and youve got a doozy of a movie that  while not as bad as it could have been  isnt a very good film  
howie stars as an ace smokejumper  a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground   
in the slightly contrived opening scenes  we witness his heroism in action  as he  and his mentor  played by scott glenn  attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire  
william forsythe plays the bad guy  a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak  
he  and five convict cohorts  manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby  
his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards  but  since there must be a movie  luck is with him  
soon the nowescaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters  
why canadian  
who knows  eh  
along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher  suzy amis  to be their hostage  
enter howie long  
hes called in to help fight the blaze  and when he spots the group of  ground pounders   apparently lost  he parachutes in to help  
when he discovers their true identity  he is the only thing standing between them and escape  and the only hope of help for the hostage  
longs acting talents are above those of  say  steven seagal  but not by much  
although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden  hes a likeable hero  and there are some hints here and there that he may get better  
the script doesnt help him out any  however  
all too often  it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny  
the dialogue is strictly bmovie material  and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable  
longs costars are a mixed bag  
at least theyre all comfortable in their respective roles  
forsythe has the scenerychewing villain down cold  down cold  and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch  even when he doesnt seem to be stretching his talents  as is definitely the case here   
suzy amis plays peril pretty well  but isnt given much more to do  
some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting  but many are rather bland  
youd think that the director  dean semler  a former cinematographer  would at least produce a film with interesting visuals  
thats not the case  
theres a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences    weve 
seen this stuff before  
its not the most auspicious start to   but it could have been worse  just think back to s debut  biodome   
however  after a month of oscarcaliber pictures  a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were  
in fact  theres a good chance that some of them are still playing near you
