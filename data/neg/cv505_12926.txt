well  what are you going to expect  
its a movie about a big snake that eats people  
thats what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film  because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more  
instead  i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me  too  
anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river  
led by anthropologists dr  steven cale  eric stolz  and terri flores  jennifer lopez   the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives  
along the way  they find poacher paul sarone  jon voight   and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda  
to simply say that this is the worlds largest snake wouldnt be doing it justice  since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide  
if this isnt a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers  i dont know what is  
at the beginning of anaconda  we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past  but that seems to be more or less over now  
i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line  but it ended up being a setup for nothing  
cale chokes on a deadly wasp  dont ask me how that happens  i dont know  and is put out of action  relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help  
this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot  since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarones plan to capture the snake  
however  this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film  and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle  
most bad characters are either annoying or stupid  
in this movie  theyre both  
since this description applies to all the characters except sarone  its hard to find someone to root for  
youre supposed to back the good guys  but you really end up cheering for sarone because hes smarter than everyone else  
or maybe hes just not as dumb as everyone else  
at times  i almost found myself rooting for the snake  
there are no standout performances here  
everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters  
even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason  
no matter  as in most monster movies  the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway  
in most of the scenes  the snake is computer generated  and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real  
however  the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences  
sometimes  for example  the snake just moves too fast  
it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall  for crying out loud  
then theres another scene where the snake eats one of the characters  and we see the snakes skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victims pained expression from within the snakes belly  
absolutely ridiculous  
a testimony to the films bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film  where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is  
in a scene totally unrelated to anything else  we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther  
the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard  one of the panthers eyeballs pops out  
eeeewwwww  
above and beyond the sick factor  however  this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed  
in films like these  a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained  
if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see  we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them  
to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters dont know about  and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown  
in a case like that  the showdown just ends up being a letdown  
when i saw the snake for the first time  i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasnt the real danger  
this one was just a decoy  and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe  
no such luck  
okay  maybe anaconda is actually a decoy  and theres really a better movie waiting to make its debut
