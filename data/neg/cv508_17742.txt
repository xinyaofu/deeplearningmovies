if the s nostalgia didnt make you feel old  the s nostalgia is bound to  
one of the latter set   the wedding singer   seems to be written by someone who did not experience the s directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine  
the wacky fashions are here  
  
  
and the music  
  
  
and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times  but it all seems tediouslyand too obviouslyinserted for the didntwedressfunnybackthen chuckle  
the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original  robbie  adam sandler  is a wedding singer  julia  drew barrymore  waits tables at weddings  
both are engaged  however  robbies fiance  angela featherstone  dumps him at the altar  and julias fiance  matthew glave  is a skirtchasing speculator in junk bonds  
robbie and julia go through the expected upsanddowns as they realize they were meant to be together  
ill fess upive never found adam sandler funny  
whatever his appeal is  ive missed it  
  other comedians i dont get include pauly shore and pee wee hermanmake your own judgments   
the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself  
idol looks like hell  and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup  
hes mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene  
were not supposed to notice that  and were not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie  
other cameos  by steve buscemi and jon lovitz  provide the only real laughs in the movie  
lovitz is especially good  playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbies postbreakup depression
