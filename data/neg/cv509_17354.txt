brace yourself for one of those painfully obvious  surprise endings   
comments  thanksgiving  
for most  its a time to be with your loved ones and enjoy a good  homecooked meal  
for the makers of body count  however  thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders  violence  profanity  family dysfunction  and sex  
boy  do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap  
alyssa milano  the former child star of whos the boss   matures to madeforvideo sludge like this movie  
someone somewhere thought itd be a great idea to pair her with rapper icet  who has since gueststarred in the madeforthescifichannel series welcome to paradox  
this isnt exactly a winning combination  
outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me  what else may be said for this turkey  
well  it teaches us that beautiful  attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed and complain about being english teachers  
it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic  stuckup rich white people waited on by black servants  
it shows us that old guys  try not to laugh  sit around and talk about  the appeal of postmodernism  during their free time  
and  it proves that you can have sex in your parents basement when they have a dozen or so guests over  and no one will notice  
before i go any further  if any young male reading this has hopes of seeing alyssa naked  forget it  
the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you dont see any of milanos attributes  
they do  however  inexplicably throw in a scene where icet whistles  jingle bells  after killing people  for whatever thats worth  
this film was originally titled below utopia  
perhaps they should have renamed it hell  
avoid this clunker
