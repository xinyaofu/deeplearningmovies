 years ago  national lampoon introduced us to a new family  the griswolds  
in   the griswolds embarked on a crosscountry journey with the destination of wally world  a worldrenowned theme park in california  
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  
two years later  we watched again as they went to europe  and four years after that  we shared christmas with them  
now  eight more years have passed  and the laughs have done more than die  
theyve been cremated  
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold  the good intentioned but illfated father of two  
the premise is basically the same  
clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation  this time to las vegas  
his wife ellen  beverly dangelo  and teenage kids rusty and audrey  always played by different actors  this time around  by ethan embry and marisol nichols  respectively  join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  
of course a  vacation  movie wouldnt be complete without good ole eddie  reprised by randy quaid   the misfit cousin  showing up at all the wrong times  
there isnt too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  
its really just a skit movie  
there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie  which is not a real term as far as i know  
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours  therefore coming off like a two hour skit  
the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits  each lasting about five minutes  
vegas vacation comes off like the first  
a good example of the latter would be last years black sheep  
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast  and it doesnt really fit into a movie mold  
in these cases  a  plot   which is generally very thin  is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags  i  e  
have a good vegas joke  make a vegas movie   
such is the case with this movies miniplots  
clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswolds money  ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton     rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage  and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie  shae dlyn  as an exotic dancer  
the simple fact is  this movie isnt funny  
at first  i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes  but when the movie got rolling  my interest suddenly stopped  
chase plays clark griswold really well  
he made the character and he is the character  
dangelo  to be quite honest  never was too impressive as ellen  and this movie doesnt show any signs of redemption  
as for the two new griswold kids  the word  blah  comes to mind  
the  vacation  series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters  the simple reason being that there is nothing to them  
theyre so generic  youll expect the credits to read  girl  as audrey griswold   
vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor  
yes  its true that vegas vacation isnt even close to being close to being as funny as the others  which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways  but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart  
first off  why did they leave off the national lampoons heading on the title  
i couldnt find any reasons why  but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didnt want to be associated with such a lame film  
thats saying a lot  especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented  loaded weapon   pcu  etc  if they expected this to be another hit  you would assume theyd be proud to tack on the notorious header  but for reasons only we can guess at  like the movie sucking  they didnt  
there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact  
the first three films in the  vacation  series were written by john hughes  a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the s including mr  
mom  sixteen candles  the breakfast club  weird science  pretty in pink  ferris buellers day off  planes  trains  and automobiles  and uncle buck  
wowzers  
what a r  sum   
looking at the names  youd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the s  
well thats not all  
this guy also brought us s hits including the home alone series  the remake of  dalmatians  dennis the menace  and the current flubber  
vegas vacation  however  didnt have john hughes behind it  and the loss is very obvious  
this time around  the script is in the hands of elisa bell  whose only credits thus far include four madefortv movies  
vegas vacation plays very much like one  and it would actually work much better as a madefortv sequel  
if this sounds like a wild idea  its not  
revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies  and they seemed like it  
vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a    a  m  
sunday morning movie  but as a silver screen major motion picture  its quite out of place  
stephen kesslers jejune direction doesnt help things either  
he only makes the film even more tvmovieish  
each consecutive  vacation  movie has suffered a drop in directing power  
we started the series off with harold ramis  who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as cowriting ghostbusters  
not too bad  
then we had national lampoons european vacation being directed by amy heckerling  who would go on to direct the hits look whos talking and clueless  as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high  
lastly we had national lampoons christmas vacation  directed by jeremiah s  chechik  who went on to direct the charming benny  joon  
kessler  so far  has one title under his belt  the short film birch street gym  which received an oscar nomination in   
granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film  we can allow for some amateurish quality  but instead we get a movie straight from the text book  boring  bland  and deeply unoriginal  
if you loved the  vacation  movies  and i know  some  of us did  there still isnt anything here worth seeing  
if you loved them  dont ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte  
if you never did like the series  why the need to confirm why
