an foothigh  footlong dragon is the computergenerated co star of this strictlybythenumbers sword n sorcery flick  
as voiced by sean connery   draco  is a surprisingly expressive creation who is welldeserving of his  minutes of screen time  
he walks  talks  flies  fries  and even fakes his own death  all with the help of  computeraided animators  
too bad that ilm  industrial light and magic  couldnt spare some special effects for dragonhearts  human  costars  
a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be  
hes a neartotal loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight  
david thewlis evil king has a high hiss factor  hf   though hes more of a mumbling oddity than anything else  
oh  and theres some redhead in a s wig  who runs around either screaming or scowling  depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant  
the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions  julie christie    as the good queen mother  a band of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavymetal concert  and  believe or it not  the speaking spirit of king arthur  
bring out your dead  
unfortunately  when we add it all together  draco  fringe bits  quaid  thewlis   the sum total amounts to zero  
dragonheart is  well  too much of too little  
director rob cohen  dragon  the bruce lee story  has made a big  expensive movie that  while ambitiously plotted  is both murky and predictable  
and overscored  
and selfimportant  
and the list goes on  
  i must ask  did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that  every  character be stabbed  lanced  or sliced at least once  
keep that man away from the knife drawer   
the last five minutes of this movie are the worst  with some silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any planetarium light show  much less a summer movie  
save your money
