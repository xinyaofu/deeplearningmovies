theres no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based  as its opening credits proclaim  on a true story  
but if its an accurate picture of life on americas mean streets  than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought  
for from the films outset  when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles  not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading  donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction  
our eponymous hero  johnny depp  is not the cheap crook he first appears to be  
brasco is joseph pistone  an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chummingup to lefty  al pacino   a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a  wiseguy   
regrettably  pistone learns his lessons all too well  
his concern for lefty  who is burdened with a heroin addicted son  exacerbates his own family troubles  his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husbands gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing  
true  the focus on pistones family life does deviate from the typical gangsterflick formula  but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins  
the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawnout domestic squabbles  including an illadvised marriage guidance routine  that slow the film down unnecessarily  
the biggest problem with donnie brasco  however  is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors  
the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the s  but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style  i loved those fluoro coloured suits  of scorces costume drama casino  
more importantly  pacinos presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively  
donnie brascos take on american values  for instance  is feeble and obvious  
lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music  
inexplicably  leftys horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us  
it doesnt any more than his family troubles do  which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistones  
just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface  
in these pictures pacinos dedication to a peculiar and bloody hypercapitalism was twisted and confronting  while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark  neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations  
donnie brascos tawdry little crime  therefore isnt so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes  but the shameless way in which it sanitises them  
  oh and by the way  i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot  pipstones superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination  is that a  damn you mcbain   
i hear from springfield way   
so the movie is cliched  
big deal  what do you expect from a gangsterflick  
well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre  
donnie brasco fails on both counts  
the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depps woeful performance tends to smother the goodwork of his comrades  
admittedly  pacino does nothing new and michael madsen  sonny  simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr  white  but both possess an unmistakable sly charm  
depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself  but regrettably  being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him starstruck  for he is completely hellbent on mimicking pacinos wellearned high style  
the consequences are painful to watch  
its no exaggeration to say that the films credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone familys uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinners phony brooklyn accent  
perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco  
maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks  
if this is indeed the case  surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that americas underworld is committed to emulating  albeit in heavily attenuated form  their movie namesakes  
depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic bigscreen gangster greats  
who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen  
but then again  perhaps donnie brasco isnt so true after all
