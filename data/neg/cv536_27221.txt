  this review contains spoilers  as with most of her films  director amy heckerlings latest  loser  seesaws between unpleasant and artificial  and is sometimes both at once  
when she tackles big issues  such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high  its impossible to tell whether shes being matteroffact or glib about them  they carry an almost documentary starkness   but whatever the case  she continually refuses to comment politically  
such is the sitcom tendency of her work  to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button  
this fear of drama soured me on fast times     look whos talking  clueless  and now loser  in which ms  heckerling also demonstrates  for the first time  zero affinity for the milieu  
has anyone  for instance  ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvaris dora  
attired in black thrift  her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips  she accepts the label of goth  but no selfrespecting goth girl ever admitted to digging  as dora does  those geriatric rockers everclear  nor willingly went anywhere with a sixpackwielding fratboy stranger  
the mechanics of losers tired old introvertboyfallsforextrovertgirl plot drive its protagonists into cultural nonspecificity  so that they become even less than stereotypes  
they become walking wardrobes  
smalltown transplant paul  a strangely static jason biggs   our eponymous hero  always wears his woolly hunters cap with flaps covering the ears  and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldnt scream  shemp   the lame stooge  wig louder  
he has three smuglooking roommates  the onedimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers  but they share similar facial features  including and especially mouths   and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam  
though theyre not overtly transvestites  heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy  how very cruising of her  
  the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged  
dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions  
unfortunately  either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated   
when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare  he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott  superb greg kinnear   
although pauls already in love with dora by this point  as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name  he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott  
shes thrilled  but nevertheless spends a few days at pauls to recuperate  the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play   cabaret    and just when pauls got in his head that shes starting to love him back in that nonfriendly way  she decides to become alcotts livein girlfriend  
cue precious hommage to the graduate  shots of paul drifting around berkeleyer    
  aside  simon  garfunkels  parsley  sage  rosemary  thyme  should never have been allowed in another motion picture   
heckerling has a lot in common with nora  youve got mail  ephron  the only other prominent chick directing comedies today  in that neither has any use for strongwilled women  
men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end  in the final scene  she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum   and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her willmere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned  shes cheerily redecorating his apartment  
  heckerling is so laissezfaire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the wouldbe rapists for jokey epilogue titles   
goth veneer aside  there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora  and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them  
heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model  and while such arcs may not be heckerlings social responsibility  it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes  
  consider  too  that dora is the films sole female principal   
not that loser is worth contemplating this seriouslygod knows heckerling didnt  
that is her hallmark
