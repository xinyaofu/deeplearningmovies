they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movies poster   no sequel   
scary movie  is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor  and it is not because the wayans brothers  shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera  dont try  
what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof  
the first movie  an outrageous  lowbrow  savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer  succeeded because of its takenoprisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue  familiar and popular  
in scary movie   the filmmakers take on the haunted houseghost story format which  if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill  did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series  
scary movie  does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist  featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn  
of course split pea soup is the punch line  an overabundant amount  which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive  
but this precredit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action  which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project  
some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original  but they lack that takenoprisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque  
scary movie  merely lurches from one lame sendup to another  offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball  and the films what lies beneath and hannibal  features that only faired adequately at the box office   john woos mission  impossible  and charlies angels  
it is as if the wayans and their team of writers  at least seven are credited  just threw ideas in a blender and hoped theyd coalesce  
they dont  
while the pace of the original left you breathless  the sequel moves with the speed of an wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road  
you can almost hear the reels panting  
scary movie  tries very hard to live up to its original  but it falls very short  
its a dissatisfying spectacle  a very weak sister of a very good movie  
the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is
