jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons  an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities  
chan plays separatedatbirths boomer and john ma  whose drastically different paths    
aw  forget the plot description  its not even worth the space  
but lets face it  
no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway  
the scenes where nothing happens in chans films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together  
in the case of twin dragons  however  the tiresome plotdriving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout  at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema    get to the good part already   
most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers efforts to hide the others existence from their own acquaintances  
why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained  but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot  
the twins love interests  demure clubsinger barbara  chanfilm regular maggie cheung  and lusty bridehopeful tammy  nina li chi   get disoriented in all the brouhaha  yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with  
the scenes describing the boys bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot  in several shots  in fact  even the makeup and hair people seem to forget which brother is which    
even chans socornyitsfunny humor is offkilter in this outing  
some of the gags are so carefully innocuous theyre annoying  
a case in point  whenever anyone sees the brothers together  they fall to the ground in a dead faint  
are we laughing yet  
as usual  the final showdown is the films jewel  a tour de force display of chan s agility and grace  
never mind that its not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crashtesting facility  
its all good fun  but too little too late  
perhaps chans next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies  
they could call it jackie chans the final fight scenes  and everybody would go home happy
