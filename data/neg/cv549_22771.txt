cradle will rock is the latest effort from directoractor tim robbins  
while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in   dead man walking   he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here  
the story is confusing  and filled with many subplots  so ill try my best and explain it as simply as possible  
the film is based on a  mostly  true story about a federal theater in the s  that produced a play  the cradle will rock  that apparently was offensive to some  so the government shuts it down  
its during the time of the depression  and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs  or are poor  
between this conflict lies what seems like  subplots  about those who work in theater  or those associated  
also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience  
tim robbins just keeps piling on political views  and characters  that we just give up on the film  or in some cases walk out  
for robbins it may be a nice achievement  but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue  and fancy outfits  
i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast  unfortunately are all uninteresting  except for a few  
let me recap what each important character does  so please bear with me  its the least you can do  especially if you were considering seeing this   
ill begin with those involved with the play  
theres orson welles  angus macfadyen  who of course is the director of the play  the producer john houseman  cary elwes   marc blitzstein  hank azaria  the writer of the play  emily watson  a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock  
outside the play theres the  ventriloquist  bill murray  who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk  joan cusack   another subplot involving a painter diego rivera  ruben blades  whos unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage  john cusack   
theres a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories  susan sarandon  philip baker hall too name a few  but those that i mentioned  were the most significant to the story  
anyway  most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted  except for emily watson  who does another great job  and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack  who always delivers through thick and thin  
now although most of the film was weak to say the least  there were some nice moments and some involving subjects  but all this is overblown  
sure the free speech segment was a nice feature  but not when it becomes repetitive  
the whole film is like this  and its basically nothing but a headache  
on the brighter side  tim robbins direction was masterful  
his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas andersons latest magnolia  only smoother in my opinion  but even that cant make a movie that much better  
although it has its moments  not many of them  but theyre there   cradle will rock stays true to its title  because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over
