  we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us   
starring lee kangsheng  yang kueimei directed by tsai mingliang written by tsai and yang pingying cinematography by liao pengjung 
taiwan    
the millenium approaches  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
sectors of the city are being sealed  quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus  
the virus causes people to act like insects  they crawl about on all fours  hide from bright lights  huddle in damp corners  
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a weeks time  
residents are advised to evacuate the area  asap  
this premisekafka by way of cronenbergis the background for the hole  which could have been a great movie  but  sadly  ends up as a waste of good ideas  
the quick sketch above suggests a dark  absurd  hallucinatory nearfuture parable of life in the late th century  in execution  however  it is nothing like that  
the virus  the evacuation  the visual possiblities of the deluge  these are all relegated to the background  
instead  the hole focuses on the livesfor want of a better wordof a man  lee kangsheng  and a woman  yang kueimei  who live in the same apartment building  and who have no personalities  
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile  the charmless rooms and corridors of a postindustrial apartment complex  photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible  
its a vivid setting  but an unappealing one  especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background  
the man lives in the apartment directly above the womans  
one day  a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the mans living room  opening into the ceiling of the womans living room  
this holesymbol of the solitary opening in the characters lonely  compartmented livesallows them to interact in unusual  and mostly nonverbal  ways  
example  the man  suffering from the onset of the virus  or so i assumeeverything is obscure in this movie  vomits through the hole  
the woman  wandering around in the dark  accidentally puts her hand on his vomit  and then cleans it up  
this is what passes for meaningful communication  
and they say romance is dead  
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions  such as they are  
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people  
they are ciphers  
instead  we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives  we watch  for instance  as the woman boils some water  pours it onto some noodles  then eats the noodles  
  this is as fascinating as it sounds   
offered as counterpointor perhaps reliefto these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers  fantasies in which the woman lipsynchs to pop songs by grace chan  popular  so im told  in s china   
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells  incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights  
sometimes  in these fantasies  she is joined by the man  
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful  sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality  but they fail  
when the man and the woman dance  it seems halfhearted and listless  
astaire and rogers this is not  
even in imagination  these people are numb  weary  boring  
the hole is part of the collection  series  a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium  
others include canadas last night  brazils midnight  and american hal hartleys the book of life  
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen  and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry  
witty  energetic  humane  it makes the the hole seem  ahem  empty  
american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements  quick cuts  superficial emotions  
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does  they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time  and call it art  
the hole is selfevidently a film about alienation  and perhaps director tsai mingliang wants the audience to share in his characters alienation  
if so  he succeeds  
perhaps it is a challenge  he dares us to enjoy this movie  despite his best attempts to ensure that we dont  
if it was a challenge  i wasnt up for it
