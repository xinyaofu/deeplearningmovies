this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset  the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st  
elsewhere for several years  and i had understood that the directorscreenwriter had written for the show on occasion also  
i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations  nor were they satisfactory  
if i had to list a reason why     
but that would be getting ahead of myself  besides  its not immediately clear  as there are so many problems with the film  
adam arkin plays a gradeschool teacher who is sardonic  cynical  and somewhat abrasive  but a good teacher  
he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court  
one day  he meets a drifter  david morse  who plays jack morrison on st  
elsewhere  in the park  and inveigles him in a game of oneonone basketball  
morse turns out to be good  and a friendship slowly develops between the two  as their respective professions progress on the screenarkins teaching  and morses selling of paper flowers to passing motorists  
so far  my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue  and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack  
good music to be sure  but it doesnt replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the storyit makes the film somewhat minimalistic  a technique i rarely admire  
suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morses introduction to a fellow teacher of arkins  a woman arkin has long admired from afar  but it too reticent to approach  
it appears that she begins to admire morse  who enjoys here attentions  but isnt sure what to do about itshe doesnt realize that he is a drifter  and knows nothing about his past   and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else  
until then  i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film  
the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a fullfledged failure  
the woman  at least to me  appeared to be fairly shallow  i didnt realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin  where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse  
somehow  this is made to appear as if it is arkins fault  and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that hes gotten such a find of girlfriend  
frankly  dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make  punching her in the mouth not the least  
after this  the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural  
if i had to summarize a major gripe  its that this is a story spread too thin  that creates semilikable characters at the outset  and then suddenly jerks them into being yearolds at the last moment  
it might be truetolife with some people  but that doesnt mean  i  have to like it  
i dont  
  
avoid
