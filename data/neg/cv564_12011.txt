my giant begins with a monologue thats more funny than not and a distinctive princess bride   medieval fairytaleinthe  s feel  
i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was  with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy  billy crystal  is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream  
and when sammy meets max  his giant  mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan  there is magic in the air  albeit it a bit goofy  i loved every minute of it  
the film  of course  plays on the size difference between the two  and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects  
i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a maxsized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons  
i also liked jere burns  from tvs something so right  performance as the director of the film in romania  
at this point  the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand  particularly during his fastpaced first scene  
it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate  as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech  
however  about the time muresan becomes coherent  the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive  
off the high board  
suddenly  we are expected to believe sammy is a dowhateverittakes slime ball  
up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure  but he didnt come off as a desperate jerk  
if he had  the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical  
but now  in new york  we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son  and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs  midgets wrestling match  which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film  
indeed  many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces  
this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal  when sammy gets max a role in a big  hollywood movie filming in las vegas  
while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself  the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation  rather than because the film demanded it  
and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare  
at this point i found myself thinking  were supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film   
then i realized he was  and i was watching it  
in the final third  the film undergoes another transformation  this time to unbridled sentimentality  
note  major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph  
max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love  lillianna  who hasnt seen him since he was a normalsized kid  
her refusal to see max  unbeknownst to him  leads us to an awkward ends justify the means scene as sammys wife serena  played nicely by kathleen quinlan  poses as lillianna  
i found this scene offensive  
not only did it rely on deception to induce warm  fuzzy feelings from the audience  it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle  which i thought was quite undeserved  
i think max could have handled the truth  gratuitous illness and all  
late in the film we learn max  and in fact all giants  have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably  
this could be an enlightening revelation  but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammys transformation into a caring  sensitive guy  and hey  a great dad and husband  too  
my giant suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions  
a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on maxs struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammys struggles to get money and become a better person  
in this scenario  maxs illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator  
sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally  
instead  were apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end  but were not allowed to focus on max  
crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances  but in the end  my giant left me feeling like id been fed gruel from a giant spoon
