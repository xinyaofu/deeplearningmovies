i think maybe its time for the batman series to be put to rest  
not only has the first two films unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a  superhero  been abandoned  but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for allout camp with few traces of the selfmocking restraint of the relatively lighthearted third installment  
let me give you an example  in the first scene of the movie  batman  george clooney  and robin  chris odonnell  are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr  freeze  arnold schwarzenegger  in an attempt to steal a diamond  
mr  freezes thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks  but this is no problem for our heroes  automatic skates shoot out of their shoes  at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick  grabs the diamond  and stickhandles it through the museum  
i might have expected this from an airplanestyle farce  but i dont think thats what this movie is supposed to be  
after all  the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superheroaction genre and kept the corny deathdefying stunts to a minimum  while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony  
not any more  the list goes on and on in this one  
robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship    feet high in the atmosphere  climbing in the door to save batman  
mr  freeze and poison ivy  uma thurman  leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond  
a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old heman cartoons  
my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl  alicia silverstone  gets in a race with motorcycle thugs  during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her  
not bad  but wouldnt the police  or maybe batman   
notice if the road was on fire  
i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place  but  
  
  
  
it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment  
as if three protagonists and two villains werent enough  batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce waynes butler alfred  michael gough   which might have seemed poignant if it wasnt surrounded by so much silliness  as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruces girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie  
all this might be semiexcusable if the story were interesting and entertaining  but it isnt  
in fact  its kind of boring  
mr  freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholsons joker and danny devitos penguin  
their evil plot is as predictable  schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words   today gotham city  tomorrow the world    
as it is lamebrained  didnt it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too    
and robins constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bullheaded and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place  
strip away the stars  the fancy set design  and the status as a  batman movie   and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick
