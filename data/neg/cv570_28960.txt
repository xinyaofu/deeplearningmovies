its a love it or hate it film  
i simply hated it  
on its menu for fun  is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongueandcheek manner  
its a serial killerhorror film farce of nonstop overthetop action and sleaze  involving decapitations  vampires  biker fights  extended gun play  and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed  
a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for bloodandgore  as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich  s of the conventional bfilms  
its geared only for the cult film crowd  and will make its mark there one way or the other  
the plot involves two psychopath brothers  the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko  clooney  and the perverted psychopath killer  richie  tarantino   who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist  
they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town  
they have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops  they have also taken a middleaged bank teller as a hostage  
in the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk  and burn down the store  
stopping off in a flophouse motel  richie rapes and slaughters the hostage  
these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody  if thats possible  
on the tv news  it says they have killed  so far and most are texas rangers  
the brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos  cheech   who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take  
with road blocks and car searches at the border  the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed  
there is the father  jacob fuller  keitel   who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident  his sexy yearold  innocent daughter  kate  lewis   and  her shy brother scott  liu   
its not explained how he happens to be chinese  
the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a barwhorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister  
the place is open from dawn to dusk  thus the films title  
heres where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun  as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout  
it sells sex to its patrons  and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium  hayek  do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire  
the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place  as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the films staple  
this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off  though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings  
ill take a pass on this one  its just not my style of a film  
the characters were as empty as the story  and the film was an easy one to forget
