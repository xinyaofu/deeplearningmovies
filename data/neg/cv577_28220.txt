around the end of   a japanese cartoon came to the usa television  and really wasnt that big  
in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was  but in  it hit big with kids and adults alike  and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time  
in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon  the first movie which for what it was  wasnt all that bad  
it grossed  million in its opening weekend  and went on to make almost  million  
fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze   pokemon  the movie   which is far inferior to the original animated movie  
first up is the plot  which there really isnt much of  in fact the plot what there is  a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon  lugia  is about it  except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever  
well there you go  of course ash is followed by his friends misty  brock  gary and his pokemon friends  pikachu  squirtle  charizard  the usual  
even though the first movie wasnt a great film  it was definately an enjoyable wellmade movie with an actual thin storyline  
this new movie however is nothing but garbage  there is nothing good to it storywise  and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors  
compared to the first film  this movie is awfully bland  from its opening titles  to the end titles it tries its best to work  but fails miserably at every corner  
the characters are dimensional  the story thin as chicken broth  and the writing very lame  
even the so called action scenes are extremely lame  and falls before it even gets a chance to go  
the voices even arent that good and almost feels like the stars dont want to be there  like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie  
which it certainly is  
the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation  although not up to disney standards  it is still very good with some interesting cgis and very colorful animation  the colors jump out at you very fast  and seem very nicely put on film  
why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered  hopefully pokemon  next year will be much better than this trash  
for now watch the first one  
its much much better
