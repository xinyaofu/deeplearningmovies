after the recent animated debacles of   a rugrats movie   and  a bugs life   i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks other insect film from october   antz   
i hated that movie  and yet  it is so much better than these latest two excursions  
  a bugs life   is the second animated insect film in the last two months  and i hoped for the best  considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixars last film  s  toy story   but in no way does   a bugs life   even remotely match up to that  
flik  david foley   an ant  who along with his many comrades  has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest  only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers  led by hopper  kevin spacey   
flik  however  feels all alone and unwanted in the world  especially after he accidentally loses all of their food  and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other seasons load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees  
banished from ant island  flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out  but through a misunderstanding  returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs  including a walking stick  david hyde pierce   a dung beetle  brad garrett   a gypsy moth  madeline kahn   a male ladybug  denis leary   and a caterpillar  joe ranft   
  a bugs life   has one thing going for it  
only one thing  
with its glorious  bright colors  the computergenerated animation is a spectacle to look at  
the film itself  unfortunately  is a lifeless  unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of   toy story   
the characters in   a bugs life   are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality  other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny oneliners  
the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable  minutes  and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout  and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as timefiller  
after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year  i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them  but then i realized this is just not so  
i still adore almost all of the older disney films  and many of the newer ones  such as s   the little mermaid   s   beauty and the beast   s   the nightmare before christmas   and yes  s   toy story   
maybe this has just been a bad year for childrens films  and hopefully  the upcoming   the prince of egypt   will not be a disappointment  
as for   a bugs life   i did not enjoy anything about it  
not the story  not the characters  and not even the voiceover work  which was far more lively in   antz   
  a bugs life   goes down as yet another failure for disney  and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture   ill be home for christmas
