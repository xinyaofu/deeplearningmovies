the year is barely a week old  and there is already a candidate for the worst of the relic  a wouldbe chiller thats more successful at making the audience laugh than scream  
in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams  whose last two pictures were dreadful jeanclaude van damme vehicles   a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses  hypothalamii   of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum  
how did this creature come into existence  and why does it feed on hormones  
the  scientific  explanation cooked up by the fouryes  fourcredited screenwriters  amy holden jones  john raffo  rick jaffa  and amanda silver  takes  suspension of disbelief  to new heights  even by monster movie standards  
but as cockamamie as the science is in the film  it isnt quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics  
miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination  turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip  complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears  
give it up  penelopeits a monstermovie  
on the flip side  tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant  but his role is so thankless that its hard to imagine it being played any more effectively  
its quite funny to see a film indulge  with the straightest of faces  in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well  and so recently  in scream  
for example  in one early scene  a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night  
ok  we all know whats coming  but as if we didnt need any more confirmation  he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away  
everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie  
and later  miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing  
does she make a beeline for the front door  
of course notshe runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall  
with all the cliches  it is only fitting the films climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film  that of someone outrunning a fireball  
if the relic is truly  the next evolution in terror  as the poster states  then the horror filmand humanityis in even worse shape than we thought
