back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention  new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its bigscreen update of the cult s scifi tv show lost in space  complete with inperson appearances by cast members mimi rogers  matt leblanc  lacey chabert  jack johnson  and even gary oldman  
that should have set off my warning alarmsthe last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago  when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an inperson cameo to peddle    
last action hero  
but no  like millions of others  i bought into the hype and  got lost   
if only i had gotten lostliterallyon the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slappedtogether blockbuster wannabe  
you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film  
at the convention  goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series  and if that really is the case  id hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in  
to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin withwhich there most certainly is not  
after the setup  in which the robinson familyfather john  william hurt  looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews   mother maureen  rogers  wasted   daughters judy  heather graham  ditto  and penny  a heavily madeup chabert  looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things   and son will  young newcomer johnson  making the best of it  and pilot don west  leblanc  doing a bad han solo impression  find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr  smith  a watereddown but stilllively oldman  cashing a paycheck and loving every minute   the scripts  stream  of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes alongand hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting  
they encounter another ship  
they board it  
alien spiders attack them  
they return to their ship  
the other one explodes  
they land on a deserted planet  
and so on  
an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act  but goldsman doesnt seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device  when one characters past self dies  the future incarnation inexplicably lives on  
the look and effects should be lost in spaces aceinthehole  but hopkins even manages to botch that  
for a bigbudget film  the visual effects are incredibly shoddy  
in one composite background shot  i could see the blue outline around oldman  the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like    
digital effects  
but nothing in those shots is as jawdroppingly unconvincing as blawp  a monkeylike space creature that becomes pennys pet  
entirely computergenerated and every inch showing it  blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game  
apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it  how else can one explain the graininess of blawps composite shots with the human actors  
but in doing so  the seams are that much more obvious  
you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystalclear solo reaction shot of judy  
new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the longrunning star trek cash cow at paramount  
i dont think so  
in a few years  the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question  what film ended titanics week reign at the top of the weekend box office
