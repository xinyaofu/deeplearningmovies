the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what its about and why its good or bad  
i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this  but i after having seen  get carter  i really cant tell you what its about although i could go on and on about how and why its a bad movie  
  get carter  falls into that category of  movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room  
you might call them the  steven seagalmickey rourkejeanclaude van dammewesley snipes school of mediocre actioncrime thrillers   
you know  the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights  shootouts and car chases but really light on plot and character development  
they have stories where the socalled hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight  chase or shoot at  
sylvester stallone stars as jack carter  a las vegasbased mob enforcer who returns home  for his brothers funeral  
he believes his brother  richie was  taken out  and didnt die from a dwi accident  
carters one of the most cliche badasses ever captured on celluloid  
his face alone is pretty intimidating and theres quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his  ramboontestosteronetherapy  voice  
stallones performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesnt realize hes mocking himself  
the actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death  
hes in a town thats not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well  
mickey rourke costars as one of these characters  a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon  played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman   
theres also another plot involving richies mistress  a secret cdrom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carters stillliving relatives  
im rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible  
i could just rip the screenplay to shreds  plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all  
i dont like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally  
yes   get carter  is just that complicated and complex  
and whats worse is that its not this intricate to make it seem smart like  the usual suspects  for example  just the opposite  
you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didnt remember what had already happened and didnt figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax  
all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another  asking them what they know  getting information and then realizing that if he wasnt a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes  
although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another  
making a movie entirely about criminals doesnt necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters  
mel gibson starred in  payback  a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldnt help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter  
so ultimately  get carter  fails for pretty much every selling point it has  
carter is not a likable character and you really dont care if he gets revenge or not  
the action sequences are not at all exciting or original  
the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all  cmon  you know whos going to win every brawl and shootout and car chase   
in the end you dont feel nearly satisfied with the results  
the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible  
  the city is never mentioned by name but i assume its seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and its always raining
