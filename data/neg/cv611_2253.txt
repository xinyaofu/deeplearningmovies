its a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater  
and unfortunately with mans best friend  well be waiting a while longer  
the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of biogenetics gone wrong  
sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a  good  story provokes her to snoop inside of emax  a poorly guarded million dollar biolab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding  
the result  she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max  a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake  camouflage like a chameleon  climb trees like a leopard  and attack with the strength of tiger  
max takes a liking to sheedy  and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax  owned by henrikson  
well  it doesnt take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman  etc    
sheedy is a boring nonpresence on the screen  tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writerdirector  i apologize for a lack of credits  
i suppose i was eager to leave the theater  and in my rush  forgot to take note of the director  writer  producer  etc      
henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script  giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film  
the movie depends upon its ability to impress the audience with animal special effects  but all it presents is a dog that can growl  open door handles with his paw  sit  roll over  play dead  and sick  
the rest of the special effects were so poor  i found them offensive  
the film attains submediocrity  an unambitious film at best  
horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite
