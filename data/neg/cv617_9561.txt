by the time dennis quaid  the ostensible star of switchback  makes his first appearance at about the minute mark  you may find yourself wondering why he bothered  
after all  writerdirector jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines  
the first finds amarillo  texas sheriff buck olmstead  r  lee ermey  facing a hotlycontested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction  
as olmstead begins his investigation  we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects  
lane dixon  jared leto  is an enigmatic young hitchhiker  bob goodall  danny glover  is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination  
all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place  the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work  and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the others protagonist  
but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse  
lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years  
hes not supposed to be tracking him any more  according to the bureau  theyve got their man  but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise  
two months earlier  lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer  and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere  
lacrosse knows his killers work  and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game  
it wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence  but its a pretty good place to start  
theres a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center  as a dramatic actor  dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation  
we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tightjawed  sourpuss pucker  we can tell hes grim because every word comes out in an eastwoodesque rasp  
a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character  pulling the audience into his haunted intensity  making switchback his film  
quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated  
its tough to become emotionally invested in a characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes  
even without quaid  it doesnt appear that switchback would have stayed on course  
the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy  building our curiosity over which man  the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor  is the real threat  
unfortunately  stuart tips his hand far too early in the game  both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal  
once the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched  the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable  
in fact   stale and predictable  describes the direction that switchback takes in general  falling back on fartoocommon hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere  a climactic fistfight on board a freight train  and edgy law enforcement agents  
its too bad stuart wasnt willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead  far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film  
played with atypical restraint by r  lee ermey  hes a wonderful  unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions  
a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a filmmaker willing to take a few risks with his casting and storytelling  
instead  stuart places his trust in a  name  star who cant carry the material  
maybe next time hell throw away that one crucial page in the script  the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story
