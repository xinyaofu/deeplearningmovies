synopsis  sullen julie james  still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer  perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas  
arriving at the start of the hurricane season  julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize theyve walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand  
comments  i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here  but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series  party of five   
i am only vaguely aware of the shows premise  and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i halfpaid attention to while watching the tube  
  party of five   i do know however  seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre  
neve campbell  scream queen of the s and star of scream  scream   and the craft  is a regular of the show  
so too is jennifer love hewitt  
lo and behold  following in the footsteps of campbell  hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own  the i know what you did last summer line  
though the original film  released last year  was watchable enough  this insipid sequel had me looking at the theaters glowing red exit sign longingly throughout  
jennifer love hewitt is a very goodlooking young leading lady  however  unlike neve campbell  hewitt struggles with acting  
she just isnt convincing in this film  and she wasnt in the original either   
this puts many young males  including myself  in a paradoxical quandary  shes very attractive  but the annoying  spoiled  valley girltype character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize  exploitatively  her figure  
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy  another rising teen tv star  and you get one frustrated male audience  
ive spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason  
i still know what you did last summer  though cashing in on the success of the original  ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses  
nothing else here is original or interesting  
this movie  in fact  makes other recent soso horror films like urban legend and john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works of high art  
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches  an isolated location  a storm  parentless teenagers  false alarm nightmares  lots of bluelighted darkness scenes  a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him  knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere  etc  you get the picture  
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killers hook  
they may as well have huge targets painted on them  
like scream and its numerous knockoffs  these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief  
unfortunately  i still knows characters arent all that funny  
in particular  one character  a chainweedsmoking guy  is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesnt die soon enough  
the death scenes  by the way  are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film  
several of them are uncomfortable to watch  and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser  bloodline  a truly sadistic movie  
this  too  did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for  
and what is the deal with the slasher himself  
i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre  but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror  
come on  the guy looks like the gortons fisherman  and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate  
though his lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter in the theater  his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film  and thats  really  saying something  
so  all thats left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy  
both prance about in tightfitting  revealing outfits or in various states of undress  yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene  
hewitt  however  does do a postshower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite  
  
  titillating  
this scene alone made this onestar turkey earn two stars under my rating system  
otherwise  hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves  
early in the film  for instance  brandy wins the trip to the bahamas  
she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever  
i needed extrastrength tylenol after that part  
oh  and the films conclusion  talk about repetitive  
people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still knows ending at least  minutes before it happens  
boring  
i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater  
admission is only one dollar on wednesdays  and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them  
its usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience  who dont seem to mind participating in a mass  mystery science theater   type viewing  
i still know what you did last summer  however  produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience  underscoring how bad it  really  is  
if it werent for the main actresses revealing wardrobes  id have had a very  very hard time sitting through this lame sequel  
i cant imagine trying to watch it on video  horror films seem  times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation  and wouldnt recommend it to people  unless theyre horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy  
i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works  
what a depressing thought  
hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act  
rated r  this film contains lots of violence  several gory scenes  and a couple nubile  horny teenagersthough the sex act itself is always thwarted  
id say this is unsuitable for kids  but teens wouldnt have a problem sitting through it  especially since they obviously compose the films target audience
