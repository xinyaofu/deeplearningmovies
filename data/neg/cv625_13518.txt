if i were to plot a graph of year against movieplotridiculity for  hollywood movies  youll probably see a line with constant gradient  
 now  if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael  bayjerry bruckheimer has made over the last  years  that line would be  exponential in growth  
the team started out with the will smith vehicle  bad boys which was no more than a hr long actionmusicvideo   nevertheless entertaining  
then came the rock  where audiences flocked  to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing  general fighting over some stupid cause  
conair was ridiculousy dumb in  its premise but it did have fun moments  and who can forget the nursery  rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi  
while these  movies worked because there was something better to coverup the dirt   armageddon does not  
very much like deep impact  a meteor is heading towards earth and they  didnt realize it until  days from impact  
deep impact settled with  the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon  just had to be bigger     well 
about the size of texas  that kinda meteor  whould probably knock earth out of its orbit    
the panic of this  sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor  drill it then  nuke it  sounds familiar  and who better to do such a job than harry  stamper  bruce willis   your very own oildriller extraordinaire and  his team of machomisfits  nursing the tagline there aint nothin on  this planet that harry cant drill    
in that  days  harrys group was  split into  teams  trained for deepspace flight and finally blasted  into space in with special drilling vehicles on  new space shuttles  
the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the  relationship of harry  a  j  
and grace  
to give you an idea  a  j  
works  for harry  and loves grace  harrys daughter  
the problem is  harry  hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself  for the rest of her life  
so while a  j  
and harry struts it out  grace  is place in a position where she is unable to take sides  so she remains  seated in the nasa control tower  crying over both of them in about   of the movie  
the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more  than just an excuse for more slowmos and goldtinted photography  
the  anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying  running  for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky  sounds fine  right  
i know  but it looks too out of place on screen  too staged  
if  you were to ask yourself  whats the difference between armageddon and  a rb music video   
youd probably just said the music    
not  surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry and has  actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully  
his  foray into armageddon just proves that he doesnt when to stop  
well theres really nothing much to sum up here  
the  stockaitkenwaterman of hollywood movies have projected their artform  into ridiculity  beyond the plane believability  where people still  accept even if they didnt believe  
deep impact was ridiculous in most  aspects and i believe the makers know this  
the thing is  they decided  to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of  suffering and coming in terms with ones problems  which ultimately  brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in  
 armageddon  is an overcrowded  loud  messy  preposterously manipulative  waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash    
if you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv  tyler  bruce willis or the tagline  from the makers of the rock     
 please catch deep impact before it finishes its run  it may be the only  meteor worth watching in longlong time  
if you have to see it  please  bring earplugs and some aspirins  for the vertigo   
expect armageddon  lds to retail at s   at carrefour come release time  
gee       even 
 thats not worth it
