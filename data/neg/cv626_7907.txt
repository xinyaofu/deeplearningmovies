  tina    fetch me the axe     
a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in   paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands  
it wasnt just the films disappointing box office performance  
indeed  in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two  three  even six times  
no  the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year  
in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events  some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming   mommie dearest  the biggest mommie of them all    
executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn  but it was all too late  
mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history  
unfortunately  faye dunaways energetic  at times ridiculously overthetop performance is about the films only redeeming feature  
based on daughter christina crawfords trashy biography  mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother  
if you believe this movie  it was a life was racked by obsession  lonliness  child abuse and rampant egomania  
the film begins with crawford adopting two children  and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grownup daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mothers will  
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves  you see  
but thats about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the films end  
the script  laboured over by four writers  a bad sign in itself  is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum  
frank perrys direction is no more than competent  and dunaways bitchy lines aside  the dialogue is flat and uninvolving  
in fairness  the films second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters  
when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling  joan visits and keeps in touch  not helping her financially but encouraging christinas own acting and career ambitions  
crawford does seem to care about her daughter  but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain  
you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers  
ah  but there is dunaways performance  
and what a delicious piece of campery it often is  
having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds  crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden  
she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess shes making  
spotting a young tree she doesnt like the look of  she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line  tina   
fetch me the axe    
with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling  
in the films most outrageous scene  joan realises that some of her daughters clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers  
oh dear  
sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum  doesnt it  
this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst   no    wire    hangers     ever       
and later  when the board of her late husbands company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship  she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring   dont fuck with me  fellas     
oh joy  
something of a camp classic  then  but if thats not youre cup of tea then mommie dearest doesnt have too much to recommend it  
better you see the real crawford in the women     mildred pierce    or whatever happened to baby jane     
great films distinguished by great performances  and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perrys shrieking piece of tabloid froth
