writerdirector lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the s  
yes  thats right  he cowrote raiders of the lost ark     the empire strikes back      and return of the jedi     
now with this film  it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing  
and guess what  
he succeeds once again  
plot  a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town  where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an openarmed swarm of people with problems  
it isnt long before he befriends the smalltown billionaire  folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients  
critique  this film is not a comedy  
it is a drama  
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer  you would think that this film secures its base in humor  but unfortunately for us  it does not  
it is a serious film  seriously flawed if you ask me  but i digress  which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake  but overall  just sits there  
now on to my review  
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring  starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past  included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst  and certified it all with many a predictable ending  
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture  but whatever it was    he 
missed  
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puffpiece  which on a good day  might be described as predictably digestible  
its no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy  
it sucks as a drama  and bored my movie cohort right to sleep  
ive given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks  
first of all  i couldnt help but think about how much the lead actor  loren dean  looked like a young charles grodin  
he even acted like him  save for the dry  sardonic wit  
this kept me interested in watching him at least  
number two  and this one is really shallow  seemed to be geared that way as well   there were quite a few  titshots   as they would say back in high school  
and god help me if i cant get enough of those in an aimless drama  
and three  and this one surprised me the most  actor ted dansons cameo  yes  he will always be sam malone to us real fans   was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person  
a different asshole  but a different person nonetheless  
if ever you rent this movie one day  promise you wont throw away your hardearned money at the theaters     
wait for his scene because its actually pretty good  
other than that  drab  drab  drab and drab  
even jason lee  a personal favorite of mine  was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while  
well  at least he finally  came out  and did some real skateboarding in this movie  
oh yeah  and i guess thats the fourth point in my rating  
anyway  if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist    this 
films your bag  
otherwise  skip it and see analyze this    again    now 
theres a great shrink movie  
little known facts about this film and its stars   threes company  fans alert    
terri from the tv show  also known as actress priscilla barnes  plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film  
the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage  so stay tuned  kids  
also  it is to note that the actress was once named  penthouse pet of the month  in march of   
she was known as one joann witty back then  
shes originally from jersey  
who the hell is loren dean  the dude who plays mumford in this film  
you got me  but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in  and played the character of billy bathgate in the  film of the same name  
jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of   
he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats     and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp  hes been in every kevin smith film except for clerks       
listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film  the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince  make a reference to the  lost ark   which is obviously an injoke  considering that it is the writerdirector of this film  lawrence kasdan  who cowrote raiders of the lost ark     
kasdan also played the part of dr  green in s as good as it gets     
ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdans  directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt
