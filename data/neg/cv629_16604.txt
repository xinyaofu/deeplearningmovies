ladies and gentlemen  payback is the most expensive episode of  the equalizer  ive ever seen  
gibson plays porter  a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife  deborah kara unger  in an alltoobrief cameo  and partner  henry  after a successful heist  
as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porters back  porter miraculously springs back to life  
he makes it his mission  as a walking dead man without a conscience  to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot  
  in a running gag  porter demands    but everybody mishears him and assumes hes after the entire   haul   
in his travels  or travails   porter encounters several other onenamed villainous cretins like fairfax  james coburn as a whitehaired  millionaire thief  and carter  kristofferson  as a brownhaired  millionaire thiefthe kingpin of the obligatory  operation    
helgelands film  which was recut by mel the producer  is devoid of an imperative dime store charm  
the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly  a  because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs  and b  because mels schtick doesnt evolve from act onehes the terminator stranded in a plot without a scifi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone  
payback should have been called playback  its a minute loop of the same short sequence  
  mel   i want my money   
anonymous villain   no   
mel shoots gun  
anonymous villain dies  
mel meets up with his hooker friend  bello   
second verse  same as the first   
its not porters singlemindedness that robs the film of snap  crackle  and pop  as a character who has already  died  once  he has nothing to lose and so much to gain  
the movie lacks danger  
the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep  
payback has a gritty  metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous  its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months  
  director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello  so vavavavoom in permanant midnight  to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig   
to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves  
perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonistsasprotagonists as tarantinolook what he did with the similar heroless botchedrobbery tale reservoir dogscould have pulled off this material  a loose remake of john boormans point blank   
the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction  all women are femme fatales  even the cops are in on it  etc   and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas  death is never in the cards for the main character  etc   but transcends neither
