american pie  reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting  instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate  they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives  
jim  jason biggs  is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance  oz  chris klein  is still the sweetest guy on the block  having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studyingabroad girlfriend  stifler  seann william scott  is still a horny stoner  kevin  thomas ian nichols  still has no personality and finch  eddie kaye thomas  still longs for stiflers mom  
have i missed anyone  
so  obviously  not much has changed  
this is not a problem  provided that the movie boasts the rapidfire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original  
but american pie  is the very definition of  sequelitis   
its coarser  yes  and it pushes the envelope even more  but its heart isnt in it  
its easy cash to capitalize off the first films success  but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original  
part of the reason why the film doesnt work  i think  is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was a comingofage stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness  
here  everything has been cheapened  
they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking  they have no motivation except for sex  sex  beer and sex  
thats not to say that you cant make a decent comedy from that premise  but it is one of american pie s undoings  
missing  too  is the sweetness that permeated american pie  the thiscouldbeyou quality of the main players  
here  the characters are too aware of themselves as popculture icons  and theyre even more onenote  
stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim  oz and kevin are forced to make awkward selfdiscoveries at arbitrary moments  none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see  
and then theres the soontobenotorious scene where jim superglues  himself to himself   which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the films ailments  one that also permeated say it isnt so  director j  b  rodgers debut  
theres a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation  and american pie  is on the wrong side of it  
its hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them  
i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie  
if theres one redeeming factor to american pie   its the inimitable eugene levy as jims dad  who pops in on jim as hes about to score and utters lines like  your mother and i have been known to get frisky    
not so much anymore  but     
and then when the girls parents walk in  blurts out  this must be your daughter  
i didnt get her name  but hopefully my son did   
if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levys performance  
this is an unworthy sequel to a grossfest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy  
the boxoffice of this onw should keep the genre going strong  which is disappointing  
the genre needs a hiatus  filmmakers are getting lazy
