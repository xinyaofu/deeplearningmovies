the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film  
since june  i havent been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky  shrieking out ahas  take on me  in his yellow miata  
why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine  
honestly  i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie  
man  was i wrong  
corky romano is one of those throwaway  clich  ridden tvstartofilm vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots  
fortunately for chris kattans precariously positioned career  corky does have some good laughs  even if most of them are of the lowestbrow variety  
kattan plays the title character  the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny s tunes  bright ties  and banal coffee mug slogans   you dont have to be crazy to work here  but it sure helps     
when his mob boss dad  peter falk  is about to be put away on murder charges  his bungling  lughead brothers  peter berg and chris penn  rope in innocent  black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence  
predictably  hijinks ensue  
if the basic plot sounds bad  wait until you get into the innerworkings of this clunker  
the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity  
corkys fbi agent identity is named corky pissant   thats pronounced peesahn  
its french     
he becomes a firstrate agent by accidentally stumbling mr  magoostyle onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations  which plays like something out of a sitcom  
and not a good sitcom  i mean  
the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each others face  
and in a scene taken straight from theres something about mary  corky gives a dachshund mouthtomouth resuscitation  
but its not a complete disaster  
the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments  including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren  a german shephard  and a kilo of cocaine  
plus  berg  whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope  gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie  
and  its nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work  
unfortunately for those out there who cant truly appreciate animal or fart jokes  corky wont have much to offer you  
so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv  asking   who is corky   
you can simply reply   who cares
