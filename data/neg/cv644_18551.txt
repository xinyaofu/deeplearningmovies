critique  ive been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now  but hold on to your brooms and incantations  cause this puppy is far from being it  
for a film that has the word  magic  in its title  this movie contains very few moments of magic    or 
humor for that matter  drama  suspense  or romance  
well actually  there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled  it never lets you in on whether its a comedy  a drama  a horror show  or a murder mystery  
or maybe its a romance  eh  
it doesnt really matter  cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting  that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them  or the film as a whole  
if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack  this film mightve had a chance to be more than what it is now  
which is an unentertaining  crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grabbag of stupid voiceovers  overdone songs  melodramatic romance  undeveloped story and uneven acting  
i only wish that i could make that one hour and fortyfive minutes of my life reappear  but alas  it is lost in the spiritual world of  interesting ideas gone wildly awry   
little known facts about this film and its stars  this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman  
coscreenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for s batman  robin  
director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours
