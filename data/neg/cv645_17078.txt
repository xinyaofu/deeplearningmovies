review by  geoff berkshire 
jawbreaker is the very definition of a  ripoff   
this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie     heathers    and clueless    and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich  s  
along the way writerdirector darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own  
the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo  judy greer  about the four most popular girls at reagan high  courtney shayne  rose mcgowan  who can basically be summed up as satan in heels  julie freeman  rebecca gayheart  a good girl with the face of a supermodel  marcie fox  julie benz  a dimwitted blonde who demands that people call her  foxy   and liz purr  charlotte roldan  an angel in disguise  
liz is everyones favorite because shes both beautiful and kind  
liz is about to turn  and  as a prank  courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning  
in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her  
they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtneys car but when they open it later  polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment  their lives will never be the same  poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat  the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at lizs dead body   
courtney  thinking fast  decides to pass the death off as a rapemurder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her  
things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to  
in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into  vylette   hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students  
up until about this point the film is effective enough  
however  an investigation begins into lizs death and the film becomes excessively dull  
the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch  
courtneys plan to frame a sleazy guy  marilyn manson  in a brief cameo  is never believable for a second  
meanwhile  the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot  
julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack  chad christ   
he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid  
ferns rise to popularity is equally lame  
we do get the best scene in the film  the only one with a spark of originality  during this section  
its a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high schools resident jock stud dane  ethan erickson  to demonstrate  using a popsicle  exactly what he would like for her to do to him  
it at least provides us with a look at courtneys personality but the way the scene finishes doesnt make any sense  
stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting  
william katt and p  j  soles  students in carrie  are lizs distraught parents  jeff conaway  from grease     is julies creepy single dad and carol kane  the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls     camps it up as principal miss sherman  
at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinemas greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer  
the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look  
the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid  
they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color  
director of photography amy vicent  who beautifully lensed eves bayou     does a remarkable job here as well  
shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive  
performances are mostly subpar with mcgowan providing only a few good moments  compared with her excellent work in the doom generation    and scream     and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty  
none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actresssinger tatyana ali  who has a small role as a cheerleader  
the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like  auto stud    college stud   and  high school stud    
the soundtrack is decent and imperial teens catchy  yoo hoo  makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film
