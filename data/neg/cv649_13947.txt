plot outline  wendy  samantha press   a jazz singer  loves mack  hugo race  a criminal and wanna be rock singer whos planning a bank heist  
mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops  one an inexperienced rookie  dominic sweeney   the other  john flaus  a worn out veteran who frequents wendys jazz club  
theyre tailing mack  because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption  
meanwhile wendys sexually awakener  fifteen year old sister  rebecca elmaloglou  has moved in with her  and is secretly watching mack and wendys late night love trysts  much zaniness ensues 
the review  main problem first  about  of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work  
unfortunately  trying to cast hugo race as a violent  sexy criminal falls into the  what the hell where they thinking  category that takes up  of the rest  
but  hell  its not as if hes the only problem in this wellintentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller  
leads  race and samantha press are wooden and dull  hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on  
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes  helped  no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut  
the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two  
which is unfortunately  the other main story isnt any great shakes either  
the second part  concerning two cops  political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled  
at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on  a situation that didnt improve on repeated viewing  
there is no doubt that this films achilles heel is its script  
as for the rest of the cast  its a mixed bag  
john flaus  one of australias most criminally underused actors  is in top form as the withering  alcoholic jazz fan cop  who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder  
although he falters at one point  when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon  but believe me  they way it was written  no one could have pulled it off  
dominic sweeney is fine  though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isnt given a whole lot to do  
pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo  but her character seems extraneous to the story  well  at least until the final scenes  
i must admit  in too deep does have some impressive qualities  not the least of which is it visual element  
cinematographers mark gilfedder  peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city  which is akin to turning london into san paolo  
the bar is an oppressive red  like all of its patrons are being baked while they drink  outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night  
if only deborah parsons script could have supported this idea better  
having two directors  colin south  john tatoulis  doesnt help either  the most glaring example of which is the final retributionfight scene  where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action  and more importantly it doesnt pull away to anything else  
it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance  
it has no reason to it  its just bad direction  
and  ultimately  that is what sums up in too deep  its tries to be good  and you want it to work  but  its just lacking the talent behind it  that it needs to succeed
