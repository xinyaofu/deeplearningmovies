the scene at the end of s dead poets society   when robin williams english students stand up on their desk and say  captain  my captain   gets me every time  
unfortunately  the court room scene near the end of robins newest film  patch adams   doesnt have anywhere near the same impact  
from the surface patch adams looks very promising  
its a story about a not so young man  patch adams  robin williams   who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people  
when the film opens  we find patch  depressed and suicidal  checking himself into a mental hospital  
in a few scenes  strongly reminiscent of one flew over the cuckoos nest   he ends up helping the patients through their problems  and its here that he finds how much he loves working with people  
so he checks himself out of the hospital  and heads straight to medical school  
right from the start  patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable  
he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry  
shortly after joining medical school  he meets and falls in love with carin  monica potter   
they  along with patchs dork friend  truman  daniel london   start a medical clinic for uninsured people  
once the dean catches wind of the clinic  he tells patch he cant graduate and kicks him out of school  
patch  like what any true american would do  takes the school to court  
its here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place  over whether or not patch can become a real doctor  
i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it  
it seems more like a series of short sketches  rather than a fulllength movie  
considering it runs almost two hours  much too long for such a light film  it could have flowed much smoother  
not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself  and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama  
robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels  
but those moments are rare and in the end patch adams is barely average
