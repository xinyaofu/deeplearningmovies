the real blonde  r  a womans face  an arm  some pumpedup pectorals  blond hair  a mans sad face  slender legs  a random hand here and there  
as the opening credits of tom dicillos the real blonde unfold  these scattered  fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini briefclad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman  his head concealing her unclothed breasts  
if only the rest of this formless  aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently  
joe  matthew modine  is a waiterstruggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas  
hes feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his livein love  mary  catherine keener   who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender  
mary  a makeup artist  regularly works on model sahara  bridgette wilson   who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disneys the little mermaid  
the bottle blonde has a turbulent onagain  offagain relationship with bob  maxwell caulfield   a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde  which he finds in costar kelly  daryl hannah   
as the film unspools  a variety of other characters pass through  fashion photographer blair  marlo thomas   marys shrink  buck henry  and selfdefense instructor  denis leary   joes casting agent  kathleen turner  and hardass boss  christopher lloyd   and a mystery woman  elizabeth berkley  who keeps on crossing joes path  
where exactly does all this go  
thats a question best posed to writerdirector dicillo  who doesnt appear to have the slightest clue himself  
his meandering  largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers  turning into deadend narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative culdesac  
and another  
and another  
at one point bob  frustrated with the soap scripts  complains to the head writer  jim fyfe  that his and kellys characters keep on going in circles  with no hint of development or growth  
that is most certainly the case here  
joe gets a job and ultimately botches things  he and mary bicker  they make up  only to have the pattern repeat itself  
unhappy with his bottle blonde  bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied  he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied  
if there is a point to all of this  dicillo dances around it  spending his time on apparent digressions that  as it turns out  arent digressions at all  
the real blonde is not without some amusements  
it does have the occasional funny line and situation  leary  henry  lloyd  steve buscemi  and dave chappelle shine in their small roles  keener is a likable  refreshingly earthy lead  berkleys appearance is mercifully brief  she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a tenminute role   and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket  last year  the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six monthsdue to lack of viewer interest   
but on the whole  the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its titleit may be glossy on the surface  but theres nothing going on inside  
  opens february
