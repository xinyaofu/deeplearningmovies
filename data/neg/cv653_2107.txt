some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch  
then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone  in  the movie has turned off  their  brains  
the real mccoy is both  
its charmless  molassesslow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta  where the real mccoy is set  might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation  
the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy  kim basinger  being arrested in the middle of a job  
six years later  karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight  
she soon bumps into j  t  barker  val kilmer   a hapless wouldbe thief who idolizes karen  
j  t  also has ties to jack schmidt  terence stamp   the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him  
schmidt  who is in cahoots with karens sleazy parole officer  gailard sartain   again wants karen to help him stage a robbery  
this time he has some leverage  karens kidnapped son  
just when she thought she was out  they keep pulling her back  in   
contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them  
leading the list is the jack schmidt character  who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins  
there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime  let alone why he would actually participate in the breakin  
karens initial encounter with j  t  during a botched convenience store holdup also strains the limits of credibility  
it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point  but instead they run into each other the next day because theyre leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment  
small world  eh  
then theres the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape  and pet tigers which  through the power of the laws of bad cinema  must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage  
however  the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police  who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day  
but the fun doesnt end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne  
there is also the absence of a single  solitary interesting character  
karen is earnest and singleminded in her motherly devotion  but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal  and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material  
schmidt is a flaccid villain  the parole officer is a complete blank  and karens son and exhusband might as well be furniture  
only kilmers j  t  is remotely appealing  but his one potentially intriguing quality  his ineptitude  is never developed  
in fact  kilmer disappears during the middle of the film  just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting subplot  
i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy  but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast  
various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever  and some end with no reason evident why they didnt end up on the cutting room floor  
even the reasonably clever climactic breakin falls victim to this syndrome  including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts  i kid you not  four minutes  
there is no tension in the scene  just tedium  
russell mulcahy  highlander  is a director with some style  and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good  but he completely stumbles in the editing room  
there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that im tempted to overlook the little ones  
like karen disarming one of schmidts henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing  
like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later  
tempted  but im pretty good at resisting temptation
