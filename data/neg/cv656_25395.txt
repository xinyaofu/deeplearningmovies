it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers  famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter  than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality  
its exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish  poking fun at something serious  in this case mental illness   throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carreys signed on too  
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening  claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality  labeling it incorrectly as  schizophrenia   and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would  of course  only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire  proving that some people just couldnt take a joke  and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes  it all seemed perfect  but one thing went wrong  their movie isnt funny  
its not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in  me  myself  irene  their most highconcept premise ever  carrey plays charlie baileygaites  a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver  decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this  of course  means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature  making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough  charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second  independent personality named hank  a deepvoiced  boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isnt above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which hes been insulted  or holding a little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted  and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isnt a problem  because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work  
theyre wrong  of course  plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort  s  theres something about mary   
  s  outside providence  was technically an earlier project   
the brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags  despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe   but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in  mary   the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleightofhand trick  theyd have you thinking the story was going one way  then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
  me  myself  irene   by contrast  seems to have been made by folks who looked at  mary  and saw only the surface grossness  missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made  mary    irene  seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor  taking shots at race  midgets  albinos  mental illness  and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of  me  myself  irene  comes off as rote  bythenumbers  adolescent comedy  
the plot  with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters  renee zellweger   whos in more trouble than anyone knows  back to new york  has an ending thats entirely predictable from the getgo  
  think charlie and irene will fall in love  
yeah  me too   
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters  and none of them ever manage to do anything you havent already expected them to do  no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing  this stuff is almost entirely softtossed  presenting an obvious problem  when grossout humor loses its shock value  its no longer funny  merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take  for example  the subplot involving charlies three black sons  anthony anderson  mongo brownlee  jerod mixon   
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while  with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film  theyre still doing the same schitck it hasnt been elevated to another  funnier level  and it hasnt been dropped either  
thats too bad  because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through  
  me  myself  irene  reeks of wasted opportunities  
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality  and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions  
this doesnt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on  so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point  involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called  appropriately   whitey    but the script doesnt go anywhere with it  instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
jim carrey is a gifted comedian  both physically and vocally  but hes left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in  all of me   
its a great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting  but none of it is terribly funny  
carrey doesnt pull any stunts we dont expect him to pull  and the farrellys script doesnt give him anything else to pull  the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting arent set up in any meaningful way  
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better  
zellwegers irene is not a strong female lead mary in  mary  may have been part adolescent fantasy  but she was also intelligent and strongwilled  
irene is nothing in particular  as the film never makes clear whether shes ditzy  clever  or neither  
as such  she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only  sane  person in the film  
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent  and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this  
he  like the others  does absolutely nothing unexpected  
after viewing the shapeless mess that  me  myself  irene  eventually dissolved into  i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves  
maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked  
but i dont believe it  good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style  
if the farrellys are indeed good  smart filmmakers  and i still think they are   theyll rebound just fine  
even after that happens  though  ill still consider  me  myself  irene  to be a highcaliber misfire
