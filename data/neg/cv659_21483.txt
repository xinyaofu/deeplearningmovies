i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor  an innocuousenoughonthesurface romantic comedy  
its not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity  but there it was nonetheless  
i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa   
in a word  its the same thing thats wrong with so many movies circa   writing  
more to the point  its the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when youre telling a story about a relationship  
the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where were expected to get dewyeyed over any pairing of attractive  pleasant people just because theyre attractive and pleasant  
in this particular case  attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon  chris odonnell   a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage  
its a scary notion for jimmy  even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne  renee zellweger   his girlfriend of three years  
convinced despite his reservations that its time to  sh  t or get off the pot   jimmy proposes to anne  very badly  
anne refuses  which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather  peter ustinov  dies and leaves a very specific video will  
jimmy stands to inhereit  million if he is married by    p  m  on his th birthday  stays married for  years and produces a child  
there are only a couple of minor problems    jimmys th birthday is the next day    anne is nowhere to be found  meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many exgirlfriends  
its a wacky  brewsters millionsesque premise  acknowledged as such in one of the films better  more selfaware lines of dialogue   the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters  
at least that would be the case if jimmy werent already a worldclass altruist  
screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will  if jimmy doesnt get married  not only will he lose all the money  but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him  costing hudreds of jobs  
from the outset  jimmys motivation isnt cash  its the livelihoods of his devoted employees  
its almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelors plot development  
by any human standard  the guy is impossibly selfless  
and thats the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor  the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness  
theres never any tension between the two starcrossed lovers  because theres no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake  
the blandly nice odonnell couldnt pull off a randy cad if he tried  so the filmmakers dont even let him  zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to  but no one dares make her anything but the woman  lightly  wronged  
and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation  
the parade of sitcom set pieces had better be damned funny  since theyre all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion  
ill admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing  including ustinovs rantings about procreation and a restaurant fulltobursting with men popping questions and champagne corks  
far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly  like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church  
youre never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor  but thats not the real problem  
nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warmnfuzzy conclusion its leading up to  
the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warmnfuzzy  theres no spark  no energy  no humanity  
its an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions  
weve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment dont even have a pulse  
the bachelor is love among the mannequins
