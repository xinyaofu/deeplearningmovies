i have a confession  
even though i am a movie junkiei saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch moviesive never seen any of the original godzillas  
  note that godzilla  is not a sequel to the u  s  godzilla released in   its the american release of a  godzilla flick called gojira nisen mireniamu   
so  part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla the latest entry in an almost year old franchise  
this was a longawaited treat  
i was expecting a goofy good time  complete with bad dubbing  science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line  
the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so  boring  
i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt  
you do get all of the  so bad theyre good  traits so normally associated with the franchise  
but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot  
its a deal i wasnt willing to accept  
hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimuras script crams in way too many details  and in many cases  fails to follow up on them  
the maneuver is not only disconcerting  but gives the movie a permanent logy  weighty feel  
godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops  
was it a whim  
a bold political statement  
i dont know  
its foe  an ancient meteor that looks like prudentials logo  doesnt just fight the beast from the far east  
no  its got to have lifesaving powers  a plot to erase  the data  from japan  a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature  
theres a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit  takehiro murata  and a slimy government official  hiroshi abe  over the handling of godzilla  and personal issues  
and then theres the plucky news photographer and blah  blah  blah  
its like watching magnolia all over againexcept without the good writing  keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs  
what a waste  
when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you  godzilla  does the jobits entertaining and goes down easy  
the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish  
the dubbing is nice and awful  with murata sounding like hes in constant need of a cough drop  
as for the dialogue  one line summarizes the goofiness factor   did anyone see that flying rock go by   
this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that ive heard the word  imbecile  used in casual conversation  
though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla  has its moments  i wouldnt take kids to see it  
theyll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose
