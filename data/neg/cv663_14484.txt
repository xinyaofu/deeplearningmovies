what hath kevin williamson wrought  
while the horror movie revival spurred on by his scream has yielded a few decent entries in the genreiknowwhatyoudidlastsummer  halloween  h  and scream it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films  
those williamsonless postscream efforts  among them wishmaster and the recent disturbingbehavior  have been frightening all rightfrighteningly  insultingly bad  
add to that list urbanlegend  which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy  
the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas  
first  the opening sequence  like that of scream  is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling  
this sequence  in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini  natasha gregson wagner  is decapitated while driving  also reveals the other obviously williamsonesque touch  the killers look  
dressed in a large hooded parka  wielding an axe  the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the iknow    fisherman  
sans the hook  
one thing horta does not borrow from williamson  however  is the intriguing premise  
students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legendsthose contemporary bits of  mythology  passed from person to person  group to group  year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness  
it hardly matters if they are true or not  such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi  he didnt   
michelle  slain by the  killer lurking in the backseat  of lore  is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true  as the body count rises  fellow pendleton student natalie  alicia witt  suspects not only a link between the murders  but a personal link to her past as well  
the setup shows promise  but the story never takes off  due in large part to horta and the director  the aptly named jamie blanks  who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares  
too many of the wouldbe shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues  and the films chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that scream tried to subvert  like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they shouldand couldrun out the front door  
but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches  theres also the climactic villain confession  in which a contrived and waytooconvenient motive is revealed  not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick  which is a cliche in any film genre  
banks and hortas  intentional  attempts at humor are also lame  the fact that the best gags are lazy  injokey references to the other credits of costars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor  
some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed  but im not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so  
the filmmakers dont get much help from their onscreen talent  
i was far from a fan of bland iknow     
starlet jennifer love hewitt  but id talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt  whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter  witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesencechallenged leading man  jared leto  
dawsonscreek star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo  gayheart displays all the depth and range of  well  a noxzema spokeswoman  and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor  
granted  the cast is hampered by their material  
loretta devine  who has done some fine work in films such as waitingtoexhale  is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grierworshiping campus security guard  
the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one mannamely  kevin williamsonto stay alive  
if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as urbanlegend  the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers many victims
