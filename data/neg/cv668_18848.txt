there have been merchantivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than  the mod squad   a selfconsciously  hip  cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many babyboomers  
well  said  squad  certainly wont be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else  maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards  
a contemporary take on this decidedly s show doesnt exactly seem unwarranted  but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didnt transform into a fullblown case of botulism  
how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad  insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time  
they are julie  pete and linc  reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd  exposition put out of the way so fast that youre likely to be lost from the opening moments on   and they are respectively played by claire danes  giovanni ribisi and omar epps  talented actors each deserving of better than this  
their plight involves standard copcorruption stuff  as our wouldbe protagonists catch wind of an internal coverup after their superior  reliable dennis farina  one of the best things here and gone so quickly  gets killed and framed for drug trafficking  
they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others  
when youre supposed to be asking   whats going to happen next    
youll instead entertain thoughts like  who are these people and why should i care   
or  arent thrillers supposed to contain thrills   
not that danes  epps and ribisi dont give it a shot  
danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep  as evidenced by  my socalled life   but shes saddled with a mysteriousboyfriend  josh brolin  subplot so seethrough you begin to seriously question her socalled intelligence  
ditto for ribisis   saving private ryan   looney loose cannon  though at least he performs with a wildandcrazy vigor that occasionally demands attention  
but epps  poor epps  
epps   higher learning   is so shortchanged hes reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him  
all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters  one of whom  scott silver  is also the director  
they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings  the look of the film is really quite impressive   itll somehow pay off  but this  mod squad  plods anyway  
characters are nonexistent  present are just some goodlooking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes  
plot hardly escapes confusing convention  
and the one genre element youd think would be show up in generous portions  a few nifty explosions  some fights  any kind of action whatsoever  only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest  
all those quick to put down last months inept but serviceable  my favorite martian  update need to take a step back  
heres a smalltobigscreen translation that really shouldve stayed in its former incarnation   mod  or not
