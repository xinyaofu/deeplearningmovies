wyatt earp details thirtyfive years in the life of same from around  to   
after seeing the movie speed twice recently  i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatts life pass before my eyes in real time  
this movie was boring  slow  boring  and slow  
there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat  
the script happily womanbashes but also tries to sound like an s movie  
they cannot have it both ways  
  i now pronounce you husband and wife   
sure  they said that in the s  
  entrepreneur   
sure  
every bit of maleegostroking dialogue that wyatts third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it  
  oh  the script was written by two men   
  no kidding   
the movie is torture to sit through  
the scenery is boring  
the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important  
can you say poor editing  
everyone looks ugly in this movie  
when you shoot people from under their chins  they look like they have double chins  
kevin costner has never looked worse  
he should sue  
he looks like he gained the  pounds that dennis quaid lost  
dennis quaid is marvelous  
if you have to see this movie just for his performance  go into the theatre at the movies halfway mark  
doc holliday  quaids character  shows up at about the minute mark  
gene hackman is very good  
is he in the credits  
i dont remember seeing his name  
mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatts second wife  
annabeth gish is good as wyatts first wife  
i though that jamie gertz played wyatts third wife  but i later heard that her name is joanna going  
she looks great but her dialogue sucks  
she also seems way to young for costner  
costner seems way to old for  of this movie  
in his first scene he is supposed to be about  years old  
yeah  right  
catherine ohara and jobeth williams are always good and totally wasted here  
this is the worst movie that i have seen in years  
the last action hero was better that this  
go see maverick if you want to see a western  
bullets for dennis quaids performance only
