david schwimmer  from the television series  friends   stars as a sensitive  and slightly neurotic  single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother  barbara hershey  of a classmate he cant remember  
hello mrs  robinson  
though quite cute as a romantic comedy  the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march  
the characters act  react  and interact at halfspeed  making for one  excruciatingly  long sit  
  and whats with the dreary lighting   
cowriterdirector matt reeves brings some snap to the storys midsection  the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for  another  classmate  a very appealing gwyneth paltrow   
by this time  though  most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep  
those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepyeyed schwimmer  a hound dog with a head cold  who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression
