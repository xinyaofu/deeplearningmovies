bythenumbers  a film which introduces characters  situations  dilemmas and developments that weve seen before in a parade of other films  
a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one  
a film which is packed to the cap with predictability  leading to very little tension  excitement  suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience  
in short  a clich  ridden formula film  
welcome to my review of the generals daughter  
plot  an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughters rape  torture and murder  
they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hushhushes  to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder  
critique  by the numbers  see above   
this film is just there  
it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours  floats around  goes away  hopefully never to be heard from again  
it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away  
its as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree  
its as actionpacked as a canadian curling tournament  
get the picture  
i sure did    its 
too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot  and to break down each scene before it was even completed  
easy as pie  
its unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film  but alas  twas not to be  that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted   
woods chews it up in the few scenes that hes in  travolta passes the test  cromwell plays  well  cromwell  and stowe is window dressing with a smile  mia since  monkeys    it seems   
and this predictability isnt reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men  it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen  
its like riding a bike  
other scenarios which sponge out any tension  suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually  breaking down  to the investigators without much reason given  a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters  as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly  and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the  best poor mans michael bay doing his best poor mans impression of tony scott   add two scenes with sunlight shining through some halfopen shades for grit and integrity  and an allout rainfall for the finale for further chaos  and youre a great director  
yawn  
yeah  whatever tony    i 
mean  simon   
and arent we all sick of hearing about these army  bad boys  and their overdone  code of silence    
enough already  
next subject  please  
see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman       
otherwise  save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead  
youll feel much better afterwards
