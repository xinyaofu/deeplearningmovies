a friend invites you to a movie  
this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare  and be grounded in reality  
the plot is as follows  after a terrifying incident  a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city  
they need fresh air to get some perspective  maybe to start over  
romance begins to brew  however  as one of the locals  played by an international superstar in rugged clothing  sparks things up   especially at a countrywestern slow dance   
it stars a rising young starlet  helms a good cast  and is directed by one of the better actorturneddirectors in hollywood  
you accept  
you jump at the opportunity to see  what you believe to be  the horse whisperer  
but  poor moviegoer  you have been conned  
alas  you find yourself watching  incredulously  hope floats  
oh  woe  
your hope has sunk  
why was this movie made  
why was it released  
it is a travesty on nearly every level  and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved  
at the hands of a better script  the film could have been a gem  
but it is clueless as to what it is about  and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers  
hope floats stars sandra bullock as birdy  who  after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend  on national television no less   takes her daughter and drives back to her home  helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands   she decorates with stuffed wildlife   
birdys nephew  travis  played by leave it to beavers cameron finley   is under her custody  and in one of the films many failed injokes  is always seen wearing a different halloween costume  
what is the point of this  
does it make any sense  
is it supposed to be funny  
the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric  but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child  
all of this undercuts the plot  of which there is none  
there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion  
theres the scene where birdy  who used to be the prom queen  is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked  for a job  
theres the scene where birdy dances with her father  in the hospital for alzheimers  
and then theres the sentimental scenes with justin  played by harry connick jr   who is taking a liking to her again  showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch  
and during each of these scenes  i was sidetracked by my earlier question  
what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume  a kermit costume  a cowboy costume  with whip   and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner  
what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life  
outside of this  there are other sure signs of screenwriters block  
when the daughter stands up to the bully at school  
when birdy almost loses her job  
when the family pulls in a goofy lipsynch to cheer someone up  
when someone dies  
when the daughter cries   no  wails  in exasperation that her father is not coming back  
in a movie like this  you notice the strings being pushed  and you sit there  comatose  hoping it will end  
who can survive such a debacle  
i worry for bullocks career  which has been running on autopilot for the last few years  
she has an attitude  a solid perkiness  and can drive a busbut she cant handle the emotional scenes  much less hold a southern accent  
harry connick  jr  is worsestick with singing  or get some acting lessons  please  
gena rowlands is the best part of the film  
but shes such a good actress  that it staggers the mind that shes weighed down by such lukewarm material here  
it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes great films is known for this film  
two notes to forest whittaker     cut the slowmotion sequences  
there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick  
have you done so  you could have shaved off tenminutes of this almost unbearable debacle  
    youve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographers filter makes the candlelight appear like little  x  s  
youre not a bad director  but you cant change a terrible script  
theres a recurring scene where birdy  working at the neighborhood fotomat  finds the machine go wrong  and image after destroyed  warped  dark image appear  
think about it  
a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie
