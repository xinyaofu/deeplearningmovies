any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project  as a perfect murder illustrates  
frankly  dial m for murder is not one of the master directors greatest efforts  so there is ample room for improvement  
unfortunately  instead of updating the script  ironing out some of the faults  and speeding up the pace a little  a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder  leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of a wouldbe s thriller  
almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities  
the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in whats going on so that these flaws in logic dont become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled  
unfortunately  in a perfect murder  the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as theyre happening  
this is a very bad sign  
not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief  but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder  
of course  in the case of a perfect murder  at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless  cardboard characters  
a perfect murder isnt a strict remake of dial m for murder  but it does borrow heavily from frederick knotts play  which was also the source material for hitchcocks version  as well as a  madefortv retelling   
emily hayes  gwyneth paltrow  is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street moverandshaker steven hayes  michael douglas   
their marriage isnt going well  emily resents stevens controlling instincts  and  as a form of rebellion  she is having an affair with a penniless painter  david shaw  viggo mortensen   
when steven learns of the relationship  he decides to confront david  but his approach isnt that of a typical cuckolded husband  
instead of yelling or threatening  steven offers david a proposal thats too good to resist  for    in cash     before  the rest after   he is to break into stevens new york apartment and kill emily  
  of course  after getting the first payment  david never bothers to ask how hes supposed to get the rest   
ultimately  im not sure which of the three main characters were supposed to be sympathetic to  the coldhearted husband  who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune  her mercenary lover  who is willing to do the deed for halfamillion  or the woman  who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair  
not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable  but theyre not interesting  
  its possible to make a good movie with detestable characters  see reservoir dogs  but there has to be something compelling about them  which  in this case  there isnt   
steven  emily  and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting  text book on stereotypes  
the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks  
michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep  hes gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife  
gwyneth paltrow  who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors  is simply awful here  
she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of s worst thrillers  the other being hush   
at least viggo mortensen  g  i  
jane  has a little fun with his part  but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies  
the thin supporting cast includes david suchet  the star of  poirot   as a police inspector  and sarita choudhury  kama sutra  as emilys best friend  
a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end  
there arent many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script  which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start  
its surprising to see director andrew davis  the man behind the fugitive  involved in this mess  but  like his stars  he too needs to earn a living  
its just that remaking hitchcock  and doing it so badly  hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough
