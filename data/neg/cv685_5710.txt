steve martin shines but sgt  bilko 
fails to impress 
based on the popular s sitcom  sgt  
bilko follows the string of oldsitcomstomovie conversion fever  
remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back  
  brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped   
i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy  but the tvconversionmovies are hitting our screens like wildfire  sad to say  with mixed success  
such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following  the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie  
sgt  
bilko  frankly  i have not seen any its original tv version   even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd  failed to entertain  
sgt  ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool  place of vehicle storage and repair  of fort baxter  
though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of  he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out moneymaking opportunities  from running a gambling den in the military garage to d pools  
though materialistic in mind  bilkos methods has thoughtfully enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter  providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that  
colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn blissfullyconfused state  bilko has managed to hide his operation  though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it  
bilkos state of ascent is suddenly underfire when the pentagon sends major thorn  a tough cookie on army regulations  to check on the progress on the  million hovertank project  a new weapon under development within the forts grounds  
to add to his problems  thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major sabo done on him by bilko during their younger army days  
director jonathan lynn  who directed my cousin vinny  in which marisa tomei won an oscar for bestsupporting actress  managed to pull sgt  
bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter  but that is about it  
there are really not enough laughterpackedmoments in sgt  
bilko to fully entertain the average moviegoer  
still  steve martins sgt  
bilko is played with finesse and fullforce by the renowned comedian  
without him  sgt  
bilko would have just fell flat on its face  
sgt  
bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world  
the current trend in mixed successes in such tvconversions may be a blessing in disguise  really  at least it will force hollywood to rethink any of its initial intentions to turn another tvidea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity  
unless you are a fan of the tvseries or love to watch steve martin in action  you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres  
im sure there are better ones around
