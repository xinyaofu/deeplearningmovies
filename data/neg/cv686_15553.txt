look  the new version of  psycho  came out and the world didnt end  
i guess gus van sant really isnt the bringer of the apocalypse  
unfortunately  though  that  psycho  didnt end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it  
van sants controversial  retelling  of alfred hitchcocks classic  film has polarized filmgoers everywhere  even before it premiered   
without benefit of an actual viewing  many have said that the film will  at best  suck  
being an  almost  good critic  i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film  at best  sucked  and that concludes the use of the word  suck  and  hopefully  the thoughts that i am a braindead orangutan   
director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it  shotforshot  using the same  exact script  with a few minor alterations   
the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary  even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time  
suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original  
sadly  that did not occur  
it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin  from the original  psycho   but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen  
in moores case  the film would have been helped if  the x files  gillian anderson had been cast instead  especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression  
from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence  moore is scully  
mortensen  who i liked in  g  i  
jane   opts to play sam loomis as a cowboyhick  which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point  
sam has a twang and a cowboy hat  but thats about it  
mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory  
anne heche  in the janet leigh role  does a few good things in her brief time on screen  
at least her marion crane has a little life in her  which cant be said for most of the rest of the cast  
the best work  though  comes from vince vaughn  as the demented mamas boy  norman bates  
hes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins  but he is effective both in being naughty and nice  
the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn  where they simply talk  
there is some solid acting there  something that is not carried through the rest of the film  
van sant has made a boring film  
all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in  arent as eyecatching now  
what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they dont impress or excite  
van sant  in what i assume is a grasp at originality  decided to put some streamofconsciousness images into a few famous scenes  was that a lamb in the middle of the road   
these images  included with some questionable editing choices  took away from the scenes themselves and caused  at first  bewilderment and  later  laughter  
definitely not hitchcocks intention  
at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score  
if a film like  psycho  does not frighten  then whats the point  
aside from norman  the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience  
there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting  
in the end  however  the new  psycho  is a noble attempt  but  alas  a dismal failure
