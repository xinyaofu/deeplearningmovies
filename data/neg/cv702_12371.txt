in   the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of abovethetitle stars  patrick swayze  demi moore  and whoopi goldberg  
eight years later  moore and goldbergs careers arent exactly thriving  but they have had their share of screen successes since  the same cant be said of swayze  who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog  
forget the mortal kombat moviesthis trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games  
good truck driver jack crews  swayze  must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey  
along the way  jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstaclessuch as a highway weigh station  evil truckers  and deadly uzifiring motorcyclists  
every so often  like at the end of a video game  level  or  stage   the main baddie pops up  red  meat loaf  fresh from the triumph of spice world   who wants to steal the cache of guns  
just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of whos driving what  all of reds vehicles  be it a pickup or a big rig  are paintedyou guessed itred  
i could go into more of the plot specifics  such as jacks dream of having a nice home with his family  the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license  the fbiatf crew tracking the cargo   but they are of little importance  
all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b  but they fail at even this modest goal  for none of the highway chaos  as credibly staged as it is  is terribly interesting  let alone exciting  
once youve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time  youve seen it every time  
as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment  the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen  its that swayze has to reduce himself to such work  
while far from the best of actors  he is certainly not horrible  and he is a charismatic presence  
i dont know if its his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog  
regardless  if he continues on this career track  could a tv series be far behind
