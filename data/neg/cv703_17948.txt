these days  we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old  cult tv shows  
most of the times  the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past  
but  some five or six years ago  there werent that many movies and the trend didnt look that depressing  
so  the people who  like the author of this review  grew up watching flintstones  popular s animated series about  modern stone age  family  werent particularly worried when the word came about live action remake  
after all  the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and  if anything else  at least the special effects would be good  
the plot revolves about flintstones  family set in fictious stone age  town  of bedrock  whose members enjoy the lifestyle of s middle class america  
fred flinstone  john goodman  works in the quarry  and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble  rick moranis  and his wife betty  rosie odonnell  to adopt a baby  
to return the favour  barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred  and  based on that  fred gets wellpaid job in management  
but  of course  this is just a sham  corrupt official cliff vandercave  kyle maclachlan  and his sultry secretary sharon stone  halle berry  need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme  
in the meantime  freds wife wilma  elizabeth perkins  must face her mother  elizabeth taylor  who cant stand fred  
on the superficial level  the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life  
computer effects are flawless  and the costumes  settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show  
unfortunately  problems with this film start with inadequate casting  rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney  while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie odonnell  
but the greatest problem of all is plot  or to be precise  the lack of plot  
some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame  original characters onedimensional  and many elements of the story  like embezzlement and interoffice politics  totally incomprehensible for the little children  the main targeted audience of this film  
result is almost unwatchable mess  occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting  elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma  and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as  high concept   
after great hype  movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version  
all in all  film isnt that bad  but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it
