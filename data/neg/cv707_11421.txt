one of the s most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave  its the   from hell  movie  
starting in the early nineties  we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationshipsfromhell  
there were boyfriends from hell  friendly neighborhood cops from hell  nannies from hell  and even secretaries from hell  
but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush  the motherinlaw from hell      
the motherinlaw in question is martha  played by jessica lange  
she has been singlehandedly running the family horse farm  kilronan  
her son  jackson  johnathon schaech  and his girlfriend  helen  gwyneth paltrow   live in new york  and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan  
but those intentions are about to change  
you see  martha lives by manipulation  
she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses  
now  she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson  
though at first  helen finds martha charming  soon she is caught in the domineering marthas web of deception  
its hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha schemes  
as written  most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted  
but then  the film even treats the audience like idiots  
it tries to get away with things  like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place  without even batting an eye  
then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isnt one thats likely to question details  
jessica langes martha is the only semideveloped character in the film  and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can  
a character that could have been simply awful is merely groanworthy  
gwyneth paltrow doesnt have much to build upon  as helens only character trait seems to be  daughterinlaw   
still  she fares better than johnathon schaech  whose character is so nonexistent  hes inexplicably missing for much of the film  
still  there have been much worse   from hell  films  
even with its paperthin characters and ludicrous setups  hush manages to create a few thrills in a colorbynumbers fashion  
you know whats coming  but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two  
the old formulas are around for a reason  but that doesnt mean they taste fresh
