after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors  mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball  
fiercely unoriginal  director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him  
there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind  
the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars  
the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo   
interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of   a space odyssey  
instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie  de palma stops right there  refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart  
mission to mars takes its first wobbly steps at a prelaunch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done  
during these surface scans of the characters  we learn that jim mcconnell  sinise  has lost his wife  
its a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety  
the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability  
there is no contentiousness  no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time  
maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff  but in that movie  the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects  
its the year  and this is nasas first manned excursion to the red planet  
a crew  led by luke graham  cheadle   arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly  which they investigate with tragic results  
graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth  
in response  earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell  woody blake  robbins   wife terri fisher  nielsen  and phil ohlmyer  oconnell   
obstacles are put in the crews way and and they matterof factly go about solving them  
i should say  mcconnell goes about solving them  
time and again  mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind  which wouldnt be so bad if the rest of the crew didnt come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable  
  mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crews mission and life is in mortal danger  
on a team of professionals  she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link  
women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male characters personality trait   
by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred  mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush  
there is an adage in film to  show  dont tell   
mission to mars does both  
repeatedly  
characters obsessively explain the obvious  explain their actions as they are doing them  explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them  
the films conclusion is momumentally derivative  anticlimatic and unsatisying  
as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film  
the best i could come up with is preteen age boys  but in this media saturated era  this films components would have been old hat even for them  
i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good  modern day bmovie  
the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material  
i felt no such earnestness
