well i guess its that time of the year again  
the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even  try  writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions  
its also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies  pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases  
in america they call this time  summer  and it happens once every year  
and maybe its the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it  but in the process normally weak  insipid lines like  consider this a divorce    hasta la vista  baby   and  youre the disease  
im the cure  actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs  
this is not entirely a bad thing  of course  
what am i talking about  
im talking about the summer  blockbusters   the  action thrillers   the  thisobviouslycostalotsoyouknow everyonesgoingtogo  explosions  gas threats  flying saucers  and special effects  
in the rash of  my  what big guns you have  but wait  
mine are bigger  movies  there are also the usual boymeetsfishandsavesenvironment movies  or whale  whatever   and  this  year  the odd crop of  savetheworldfromaliensorenvironment threats  offerings  
im talking about the three batmans  the speeds  the terminators  etc  this year im talking about twister  independence day  the arrival  the rock  mission  impossible  and of course  eraser  
here in singapore  as our local movie critics like to whine  we seem to get the pick of the crop of  my explosion is more reallooking than yours  movies  but nothing else  
mission  impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us  
the same goes for eraser  which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called  mission  unavoidable   on account of its worldwide megaadvertising blitz   eraser seems like a cheaper  less thoughtful imitation  
thats saying a lot  because mi the movie was already a cheap  thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the ss  
in eraser  arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger  
he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and resituating them with new identities  
his new case is lee cullen  played by vanessa williams who  unlike all the other scumbags hes ever relocated  is  an actual  real life honest person   
because shes so good  and has such nice legs  arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her  and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from  his  killers  
lee obtains evidence that the hightechnology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated  blackmarket arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair  
of course  as the formula goes  her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck  there are people in high places who will go down with this  because yes  this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world  that is  america  since watergate  
in protecting lee  arnold is framed by the mentorturnedevil robert deguerin  nicely played by james caan  and ends up having to prove that he isnt the one killing the programmes witnesses in addition to making sure lee isnt accidentally torpedoed to death by the new  green guns his enemies all have  
its around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission  impossible theme  because arnies mission includes breaking into a highsecurity building to run a disk  
i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about  
its an electromagnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles  and which can see through walls  
it has some sort of xray vision  so its user can target the victims heart even from great distances  
despite this  which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun  though im certainly no expert   however  arnold  whose own heart is targeted a number of times   never  goes flying  feet backwards with a twofoot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun  
instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time  giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous   ill be back   
like everyone else in the theater  i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me  because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily  
although there is a  lot  of violence in this movie  not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators  i recommend this movie to most overs who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas  
reviews rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
