the rapidfire formula that worked so well in airplane   the  police squad   
television series  top secret   three naked gun films  and two hot shots  
movies has finally reached a desperate deadend with spy hard  
even ezio gregios the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this overextended spy and actionmovie spoof  
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd  who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis  general rancor  a cackling andy griffith   
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint  timing  or tact  
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags  recreated movie sequences  and soggy star cameos  
yeah  maybe we  do  need ray charles driving an l  a  bus bound for a speed bump  but did mr  t  hulk hogan  and dr  joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie  
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair  
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nuns habit  even the resulting sister act spoof is silly  
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone  pulp fiction  true lies  etc  etc   adolescent males might enjoy this mess  tho  
the butt shots  breast peeks  penis pokes  flatulence gags  and related innuendo are right up beavis and buttheads alley   
beyond the hilarious title sequence with  weird  al yankovich performing the theme song  spy hard is barely the stock that its printed on  
my recommendation  duck in while youre waiting for another movie to start  
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird als nostril and then leave  
you wont miss a thing
