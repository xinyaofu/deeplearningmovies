girl  is  in a word  a mess  
i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film  
there was no sense of where the film was going  or any kind of coherent narrative  
if there was a point to the film  i missed it  
girl   by the way  is the way theresa randles character is addressed in the phone sex workplace  all the girls are known by their numbers  
the plot  such as it is  theresa randle is a struggling n  y  actress  and eventually takes a job as a phonesex operator  
she begins to lose contact with reality  as her job consumes her  
also  she must deal with the advances of her exhusband  isiah washington   
he is an ex con thief  and she tries to keep him away  while at the same time  its clear that she still harbors feelings for him  
her neighbor  jimmy  spike lee  functions as the observer  mediating between the ex husband and girl   
he also functions as a point of stability  as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex  
the soundtrack  consisting of songs by prince  was jarring  
it kept taking my attention from the film  not altogether a bad thing  ill grant you  as what was transpiring onscreen wasnt that riveting  
for parts of the middle of the film  the music stayed blissfully in the background  
in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film  however  the music was particularly loud and distracting  
of course  ive never really cared for princes  or tafkap if you like  music  
prince fans might love the soundtrack  but it will probably be distracting  even to diehard fans  
of the performances  the only one that stood out was spike lees buddy character  jimmy  
he was excellent as the alwaysbroke neighbor of girl   
he should have stuck to acting in this film  
there are several sequences that gave me the impression that hed like to be oliver stone when he grows up  
there are scenes shot with different types of film  which are purposely grainy  and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stones natural born killers  
in that film  they worked to propel the narrative  
in this film  they just made me more confused  
there are some amusing moments  and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phonesex industry the multibillion dollar industry that it has become  
other than that  though  nothing much happens  
there are a few intense moments  as when one caller becomes frightening  but even that is rather lackluster  
im not the biggest fan of spike lee  though id agree that he has done some very good work in the past  
in girl   though  he seems to be floundering  
he had an interesting idea  a fairly good setup  and seemed to wander aimlessly from there  
girl  earns a grade of d
