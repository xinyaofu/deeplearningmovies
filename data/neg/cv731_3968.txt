we could paraphrase michelle pfieffers character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an  a   
thats fair enough  
all movies  like all school children  should be given the benefit of the doubt  
the chance to succeed  
after all  we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders  
mountains can be moved  and good movies can be made  
yeah right  
children fail  as do films  
as does director john boormans latest  
the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette  ed wood  true romance  as the busty westernerinperil wandering about  burma without a passport  
though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there  its a tougher task to overlook the actress  
shes a lightweight  
as the first scene  with narration   
demonstrates  she doesnt have  nearly  enough range for the emotions that her charactera mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and sonis supposed to show  
she may give a stronger performance than  say  keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds  by not by much  
beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film  thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman  deliverance  excalibur  hope and glory   
he keeps the narrative moving  no matter how muddy the storyor the heroinegets  
why he chose arquette remains a mystery  though  
maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies  
but even after an hour of halfstated political statements and murky mass killings  we  still  dont know enough of whats happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations  
empty exoticism  
the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix  combining lush jungle photography with bad bluescreen work  
also odd is the obvious dubbing  
done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign  
and  is it my mistake  or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers   
doo doo doo doo  
  twilight zone  theme  or opinion of movie  
you be the judge
