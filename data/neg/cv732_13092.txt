i think that saying that the xfiles is one of this summers most anticipated films is safe  
for five years   the xfiles  television show has developed a dedicated fan culture  whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of  star trek  fans  
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal  fox mulder  david duchovny  is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid  and dana scully  gillian anderson  is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulders flights of fancy  
outlining the plot of the xfiles movie is virtually impossible  since to be general would result in confusion  yet to be specific would give too much away  
nevertheless  i will try  
  the black ooze   and extraterrestrial  viruslike substance is threatening earth  
a  shadow government  is aware of this  but tries to coverup the alien existence  
mulder and scully know  the truth is out there   and so try to expose both the invasion and the coverup  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie    
will those who dont watch the series be able to understand the movie  
yes  
isolated as an individual text  the xfiles can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone  familiar with the show or not  to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters histories may confuse the uninitiated  those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem  they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place  and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee  
why bring in  the lone gunmen   three computer geek conspiracy theorists  for an even briefer appearance  
these characters are recurrent on the series  and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience  suggesting their popularity among fans  actually most of the audience could pass for  the lone gunmen    
still  then they vanish just as quickly  
  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things  
yes  
in the xfiles we get a fairly complete history of  the black ooze   what it is and what it wants  
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the  shadow government   
there are even some subtle tieins with contemporary ufoology  including the  greys  and the roswell crash of   
  is the movie any good  
no  the xfiles is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writercreator chris carters talents and the relationship between cinema and television  
first off  the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched  
after approximately fortyfive minutes  the length of a television episode minus the commercials   the pace drops to a snails crawl  
not long after that point  when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series  we wish he had not  
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much  
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit  but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much  
breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie  and listening to other fans leave the cinema  maybe the series too  
the explanations are not only absurd  they are tired and unoriginal  
the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series  and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day  
note that the alien movies  id  and the xfiles are all from thcentury fox  a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think  
the xfiles is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  
however  i rather liked that about the series  
television allows you to impose as much  or as little  meaning on a show as you want  
it is the proverbial  blank screen  which we project our minds on  
meaning on television is open and ambiguous  it is the nature of the medium  
cinema  on the other hand  is the opposite  
it projects onto us the filmmakers mind  
we can  in some films  fill the textual gaps ourselves  but that almost never happens in an american film  
meaning  in cinema  needs to be selfcontained and determined  
so  when the xfiles made that jump from small to big screen  carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well  
he did not  
by making explicit  what the television show left implicit  carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill  
when they say that  fans  make a tv show  it is not far from the truth  
on television  fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there  
how true that is when we see the  explicit  xfiles  there is nothing there
