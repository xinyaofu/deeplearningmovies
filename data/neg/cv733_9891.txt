contrary to popular belief  not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece  
some of them arent even good  
some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful  un indien dans la ville   presented as  little indian  big city   and remade into that crap tim allen flick   junglejungle    and this  
what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick  
  french twist   the  cool  american title  not the real one  which was  gazon maudit   literally meaning  twisted ground   or something like that  deals with a married couple with kids  and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them  
loli and alain chabat  victoria abril and alain chabat  are not exactly happily married  
always on business trips  alain chabat more than once cheats on her  and she eventually finds out  
and one day  she meets a butch mechanic  marijo  the cowriterdirector josiane balasko   and they two kinda hit it off  
so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious  sleeping with marijo  
but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo  but shes also realizes shes still in love with alain chabat  
so  of course  she does the obvious from that  she decides to keep them both  
shell be  and sleep  with each of them for  days each  then on sunday  shell rest by herself  
after all  she needs it if shes gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel  
the film goes on for over an hour and a half  through stupidity after stupidity  moronic twist after moronic twist  and soon theres the little ironic      
ending  
i know its a completely different culture  and im quite familiar with the french and their cinema  but this is just bad  
none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in  fargo   a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point   and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience  
whats shocking is this was not only one of frances biggest hits  but it was nominated for a lot of cesars  french equivalent of oscars   
the writing and directing is really the big problem with it  
josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role  but her little sex comedy isnt very humerous  entertaining  or even deep at all  
even woody allens notverygood  a midsummer nights sex comedy  is intelligent  wellwritten  and possesses some depth  
this is shallow  unfunny  and pretty annoying to watch  
the film moves at the pace of a snail  and is damnnear painful to watch  
thank god for the fast forward button  
the acting  however  isnt bad at all  
the actors do the best they can with the bad material  and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script  and the fact that shes stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids   
and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband  
but  french twist  is just pretty lame  
its not overly horrible  and has a couple very  very  very brief moments  
but its just a really crap film  and an example of an illadvised distribution of a foreign film
