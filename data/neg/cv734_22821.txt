i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stones any given sunday  
its an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rockem  sockem profession of pro football  
unfortunately  the director seems to have only one priority on his mind  sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers  
in altering each frame with quickflash photography and dizzying  inyourface editing  stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics  
we see glimpses of greatness  but any given sunday has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledygook  
it grows tiresome and monotonous  
yes  stone has pulled a brian depalma  
matters of importance are pushed aside right from the getgo  
tony damato  al pacino   coach of the struggling miami sharks  finds his team stuck in a losing rut  
aging quarterback cap rooney  dennis quaid  appears to be losing his touch  and damato cant seem to ignite any passion in his squad  
when cap is injured on the field  and after a patch of unlikely events occur  thirdstring qb willie beaman  jamie foxx  is brought into the game  
once in the huddle  and this becomes an ingame ritual   beaman horks all over the field  
nerves  you see  
eventually though  the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates  sparking his rise to fame in the football world  the endorsements  the music videos  etc   and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behindthescenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like  
and i believe it  
there is some intriguing insight posed  but in the big scheme of things  stone fumbles the ball  
the problem with the directors visual approach is this  he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate  
football is an exciting game to watch  but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush  
i guess he is mistaken  
any given sunday is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them  
many football fans  including one i attended with  are liable to be disappointed with the ultrastylish way stone has decided to present the game  
in return  a threestar film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the directors tampering  
in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break  this actually shows decent character development and interaction  
for instance  heated returns between damato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci  cameron diaz  are enjoyable to watch  
there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx  who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory  
the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine  aaron eckhart  lauren holly  annmargret and charlton heston  in an extraordinarily brief appearance   
unfortunately  too many big names are wasted  a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast  
pacino makes some interesting progress with his character  
you begin to identify with coach damato and the morals he is striving for     
but i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics  
any given sunday is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique  
and a very distant back seat  at that
