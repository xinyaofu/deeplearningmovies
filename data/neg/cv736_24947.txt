  battlefield earth  is the best comedy of the year  
it has to be  
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  
bad movie syndrome struck me again  so after witnessing how much  battlefield earth  has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles  i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firsthand  
is it as bad as advertised  
oh yes  very much so  
the plot is incomprehensible  
the acting is atrocious  
the special effects are mediocre  
the action is dull  
the implausibilities are legion  
the dialogue is cringeinducing  
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  
i dont even want to continue reviewing this movie  id like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible  but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory  so here it is  
the premise is basically a ripoff of  planet of the apes   only minus the apes and philosophical discussion  and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  
the year is   the psychlos have conquered earth  and the human population has been enslaved  
only a handful of humans escaped to radiationrich areas to escape the aliens  they live out their lives in fear  
one man  johnny goodboy  i know  i know  tyler  barry pepper   ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  
there he confronts the psychlo head of security  a big  ugly  klingonlooking creature called terl  john travolta   
pressed into slavery  johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  
meanwhile  terl is faced with his own problems  he has recently learned that hes stuck living on earth  which he hates  for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big mans daughter  
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology  this is where the plot gets ridiculous  
  
   
so the  mananimal  can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos cant go  
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  
of course  his plan doesnt work  
so many things wrong with this movie  where to begin  
how about with travolta  whose hollywood clout brought about this  the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbards scifi novel  
early previews for  battlefield earth   with constant shots of a makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor  had me  and several audience members  remarking   what the hell is travolta thinking   
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here  terl cackles after nearly every line  and so does every other psychlo  
of course  this makes every scene hilariously overwrought  no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america  but ceos generally dont laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees  
   you were going to be promoted  but now youre not  
fwahahahahahahahaha        
its no big surprise terl loses to the humans  hes an idiot  
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  
he underestimates his enemies  assuming hell win just because hes smarter  
  he uses the word  leverage  like some sort of scientologist mantra   
not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero  he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology  
  why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me   
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  
no wonder this guy never got his promotion  
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention  
why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive  
how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open  
how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for    years  
and how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly  
theres a whole lot more to scratch ones head about in  battlefield earth   
bring a scorecard to track the plot holes  
director roger christian shoots  battlefield earth  in the most distracting way possible  tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason  
all the characters appear to be standing on the walls  and its awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue  
the action sequences are atrociously edited  every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement  
are these things really so hard to construct  
my respect for supposed  lightweight  action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in  battlefield earth  how badly an action sequence can be shot  
this movie is an absolute headache  
its not just the shot selection and editing  the movie  quite frankly  makes no sense  
for most of  battlefield earths  running time  i just didnt know what was happening  
it didnt have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical  though they certainly are   i really had no idea what the hell was going on  
when i pieced the plot together later  it didnt look any better  
heres how much of a disaster this is   battlefield earth  is already the worst movie of the year  and its going to take something really  really inept to top it  
the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it  
in fact  id think that hubbards cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible  
thatll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again
