in this years summer movie preview issue of entertainmentweekly  theresa connelly described her writingdirecting debut  polishwedding  as  a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would   
one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film  a comedydrama that appears doomed at its most basic elements  
the family at the center of polishwedding is the pzoniaks  which consists of mother jadzia  lena olin   father bolek  gabriel byrne   sole daughter hala  claire danes  and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness  
its a large family  but theres not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch  certainly not in the primary trio  
jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family  but shes kind of a hypocrite since shes carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija   
her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek  who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration  
also  how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy  sexy jadzia  
hala is a spoiled  selfcentered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy  
with such an unappealing set of characters  its no surprise that polishweddings plot complications are far from involving  
naturally  jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop  russell schuster  adam trese   who fathered the child  but he refuses to make such a commitment  
hohum  
another complication  involving the decidedly unvirginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary  is first played for laughs and then  inexplicably  as a profound statement in the films climaxwhich  ironically  is funnier than any of the films lame attempts at humor  such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell  
that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly  
the jadziabolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers  
the halarussell conflict isnt resolved in as contrived a manner  but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something  
and then theres some atrocious dialogue  which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound   look at all these pickles  
just looking at them gives me such great sadness   
as misguided as polishwedding is  the affair is something of a letdown  considering the strong performances by byrne  danes  and especially the fiery olin  
they obviously believed in connelly and her materiala faith that audiences will be hardpressed to share
