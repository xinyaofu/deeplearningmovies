talk about beating a dead horse  
when home alone was released in   it was a breath of fresh air  and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinelyfunny family film  
the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel  so  two years later  we were subjected to home alone   which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited  
for john hughes  two home alone movies werent enough  he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with  including a pathetic box office bomb called babys day out  last years liveaction  dalmatians  and this years flubber  
now  inexplicably  hughes has exhumed not only these wornout plot elements  but the  home alone  name as well  
the result  s worst sequel  edging out speed  and batman and robin   home alone   
by changing the characters  hughes  who wrote and coproduced the film   along with his coconspirator  director raja gosnell  has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest  
the new kid  alex pruitt  is played by alex d  linz  one fine day   and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness  
hes not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was  
the villains  pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern  are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber  
in home alone   there are four of them  olek krupa  david thornton  lenny von dohlen  and rya kihlstedt   but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls  
this time  the kid isnt left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip  
instead  he has developed a bad case of chicken pox  so he cant go to school  
his dad  kevin kilner  is away on business and his mom  haviland morris  has to run errands  so  for the most part  hes all by himself during the day  
through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate  a top secret u  s  air force integrated circuit comes into his possession  
its wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alexs home to retrieve it  
the eight year old  who is wise beyond his years  booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldbergtype devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains  
the movies climax takes place during a raging snowstorm  only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable  
previously  the most counterfeitlooking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii  
these are far worse  
in fact  the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this nearblizzard when a shining sun can be seen  
if its a wonderful life could generate real looking snow back in the s  why cant home alone   which has a significantly larger budget and s technology at its disposal  
there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of liveaction cartoon violence for young children  
home alone  will add fuel to the fire  
its one thing to see wyle e  coyote flattened by a  ton acme weight  but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen  
adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous  but what about five and sixyear olds  
the level of violence in home alone  is extreme  many of alexs schemes are nasty enough to kill  
but  because this is a  family film   no one dies  despite being electrocuted  falling thirty feet  and getting smacked on the head by a barbell  
not only is home alone  unnecessary  but its offensive  
its an exercise in tediousness  and there isnt a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end  unless  by some strange quirk of fate  you have missed every s movie associated with john hughes  and thus havent seen this stuff before   
i cant imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure  
maybe thats why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumbsucking years
