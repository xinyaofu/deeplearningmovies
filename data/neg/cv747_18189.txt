in s  many european intellectuals  especially those on the left political hemisphere  became obsessed with the rise of fascism  
which wasnt so hard to expect  because the social turmoil of s and economic decline of s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies  
in such times  when political involvement could be associated with noble passion  many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of prewar europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany  
of course  there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other  less noble reasons  
for them  moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era  
which  naturally  made some of those films very popular among teen audience  
one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass  who later made career shooting expensive  stylish soft porn  
salon kitty  his  film  is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern  book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww  
in   walter schellenberg  one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite  exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats  
none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents  and that all the rooms happened to be bugged  
the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty  nominal madame of the brothel  didnt know the real purpose of that enterprise  
screenplay by tinto brass  of course  simplifies the story and changes few names  
schellenberg is now wallenberg  helmut berger   ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top  
kitty kellerman  ingrid thulin   apart from being madam  has a second job as a cabaret singer  
caught in the net of depravity is sweet  innocent girl margerithe  theresa ann savoy  thrown into brothel  
there she falls in love with customer hans reiter  bekim fehmiu   disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe  
when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel  she finds out that the place is bugged  
she informs the madam of the real situation  and both women decide to confront wallenberg  
those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film  that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation  
but  although salon kitty doesnt happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn  although not very successful  some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing   it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict  this time between powerhungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty  
unfortunately  brass seems to overuse other cinematical references  probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino viscontis the damned  but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulins unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minellis musical numbers from cabaret  
all in all  salon kitty is failure  although with some very interesting moments
