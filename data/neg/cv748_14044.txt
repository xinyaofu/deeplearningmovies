dr dolittle  th century fox  running time   hour  minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor     murphy returns in this abysmal comedy  
he plays doctor john dolittle  who as a child had the ability to understand animals  
however  after being exorcised he loses this ability  and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people  most notably dr mark weller  played by oliver platt   
however  with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns  and comedy is ready and waiting to happen  
except comedy never does happen  
doctor dolittle  even with the excellent premise  rarely manages to raise a laugh  
poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie  and his performance suffers  
the manic murphy we saw in the s is gone  his more mature  and more boring  twin appears to be getting all the work in the s  
the voices of the animals  which include albert brooks  chris rock  the new eddie murphy  and norm mcdonald as lucky the dog are marginally better  and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie  
sadly  most of their lines are pretty dumb  
and theyre not funny dumb  like dumb  dumber     but just boring dumb  
the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through  in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs  
there are a few good jokes in the script  but they are few and far between  
if i had to choose a favourite performance  it would probably be albert brooks tiger  who has a certain charm about him  
sadly  hes barely in the movie  and rocks really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time  
joke wise  we are thankfully  spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor  
the director  betty thomas  has  well  done better films  
she bought us private parts    and the brady bunch movie    which were  sadly  much better than this  
the scenes lack any charm  she just gets the job done  
the animals themselves  are reasonable realistic  although most of them are obviously puppets  
theres an impressive looking tiger  however  and the lip sync is pretty good  
youd have no problem guessing that most of the close ups are puppets  however  with their jilted movement  
i was hoping jim hensons workshop  who created the furry friends  would have done a better job  
doctor dolittle  in the end  is a disappointment for everyone involved  
murphy has done much better movies  i  e 
trading places  the director has seen better days  and even the creatures arent that good  
the target audience  aged between   who are undemanding  will probably like it however  thanks to its dumbed down humour  
everyone else  however  should give doctor dolittle a miss
