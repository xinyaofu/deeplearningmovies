bad movies described as  a swift descent into sinful pleasure  decay  and debauchery  are hard to watch  
bad s movies that resemble bad s films are even harder to watch  
shadow hours falls into the latter category  a mishmashed train wreck of bmovie actors  including michael dorn  aka star treks worf   an uninteresting plot  vain attempts at capitalizing on the  underground  scenes of seedy los angeles  and really  really bad directing and horrendous music videoesque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out  
the film revolves around the life of michael holloway  balthazar getty  who is trying to restart his life with his onedimensional wife chloe  rebecca gayheart  after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions  
michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l  a  one night  he meets a strange gent named stuart  mr  buckaroo banzai  peter weller   
he drives a porsche  smokes french cigarettes  and drones on about life  eventually coaxing mike into exploring the  underbelly  of l  a  together  a tour of punk bars  sm clubs  and bareknuckle fights  
the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene  acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask   the film then simply dissolves into a cheap ripoff of dantes inferno mixed with an old stephen j  cannell television pilot  
the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus  
other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen  johnny depp  richard griecoesque acting of balthazar getty  
peter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesnt give two shits about it  
and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs  dance clubs  and brothels  damn  isnt anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood   
way back in   a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city  
shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel
