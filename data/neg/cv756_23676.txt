jet li busted onto the american action movie scene  when he stole the show in s lethal weapon   with his wicked looks  his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma  
it only took another two years for megaproducer joel silver to set him up in an allamerican movie  primed to take over some of the empty actionhero seats left by alleged cokehead van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal  
would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts  namely chow yunfat and jackie chan  
lets find out  
plot  rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another  when members of their respective families start turning up dead  
thats when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brothers death and to exact some of his own style of revenge  
critique  three words  not enough action  
simple enough  
not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay  bad actors  crappy dialogue and ohso many overthetop melodramatic moments  
and a romance angle  
why  one must ask    why  
i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too  but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences  and jet  well  the poor dude was barely in the movie  
and i thought this was supposed to be his big break  
how bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kungfu fighting chops  slap him in a few more scenes  and give him more chances to practice his actingenglish abilities  
what a letdown  
even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up  empty shell of a film  
in fact  i am sure that more time was spent gathering the  hits  for the soundtrack of this film  than were on the socalled  screenplay   
i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time  
the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldnt matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines  
but no  save lindo and aaliyah  who werent too shabby  i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly  
and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some year old looking guy  acting like hes the overlord of a drug ring   
what a mess  
then again  i dont want it to seem like im complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable  since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway  not the story  
well  i guess thats what disappointed me the most out of this film  
there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li  but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving  
also  as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts  a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt  
it should be seamless  fellas  not necessarily against the laws of gravity  
the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow  but that simple creative touch couldnt save the rest of this films uninteresting plot movements  
im disappointed for jet li that this film didnt give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes  
hopefully  the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor  
for now  i just hope that for his sake  the films title isnt a premonition of the movies ultimate fate at the boxoffice
