when considering david finchers latest film   the game   four words come to mind  
  dont believe the hype   
this michael douglas vehicle  from the director of  seven   isnt nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept  aided no doubt by the riveting trailer  where a jaded millionaire  douglas  is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  
this isnt simply virtual reality  
this is real life with a deadly twist  
on his th birthday  nicholas van orton  douglas  is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother  conrad  sean penn   
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother  
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services  
  they make your life fun   conrad tells him  
nicholas humors his brother  telling him hell call  but its clear he has no time for any foolish   fantasy roleplaying   as he calls it  
then  for reasons that are never really made clear  nicholas decides to go to crs and see what theyre all about  
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process  which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  
nevertheless  when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client  the weird things start happening  
of course  when weve only covered about  minutes of screen time  what else should we expect  
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful  violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  
one of those films   basic instinct   came from the creative minds of writer  joe eszterhas and director  paul verhoeven  
the premise of  the game   is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film   total recall   
in that case  the premise was implanting someone elses memories as a way to enhance ones own life through a dream vacation  
yet  in both films  the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience  
we live the adventure along with the protagonist  reacting to each twist and turn  
in theory  the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isnt  
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride  when the truth is finally revealed  
now  for those of you who forgot  let me say this again  
  dont believe the hype   
  the game  is not a thrilling roller coaster ride  
as a suspensethriller  it doesnt do much but spin in circles  
by the third reel  i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot  
is it any wonder douglas wont be able to resist the charms of a mysterious  potentially lifethreatening blonde  ever heard of glenn close  
no  well  how about sharon stone  
thought so   
if anything in this film surprises you at all  i would guess you havent seen that many films  
there is no suspense here  
trust me  i looked hard to find some  
i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations  
fincher aims for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas  
there are those that might say  the game  is not intended to be viewed literally  
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film  
the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues  
there is a moment early in the film where van orton  realizing his game has begun  smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out whos in on the whole thing  
he is charged by his paranoia  
he is looking at the world through new eyes  
it is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film  
from there on  the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us  
any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device  
at the outset  were told each  game  is tailored to the individual  
ultimately  this  game  is supposed to work like a crucible  trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire  proving his soul  
yet  as douglas endures his personal gauntlet  were given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is  
i wanted to like this film more than i did  
i look at it as just anothergreat idea  poorly realized  
i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didnt mean we were seeing what was really happening  
bryan singers  the usual suspects  for one  a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas  
also  there is the underrated  jacobs ladder   with tim robbins  a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism  
here are two examples of films that dont simply manipulate for manipulations sake  
there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place  
one major issue that comes up in  the game  is whether or not the whole  illusion  is just a highly sophisticated con game  
well  i can tell you right now  after youve spent your  dollars  you may be asking yourself the same thing
