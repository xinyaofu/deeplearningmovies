it seems that ive stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch  
take payback  for example  a movie that most people seem to like  
however  its horrible schlock  straight out of hollywoods vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies  
it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better  however  maybe he did do better  after all   percent of the movie isnt his own  
mel gibson  that hollywood zombie  decided he didnt like the ending and had another director reshoot it  
what a crock  
if you sign on to do a movie  then do it the way the script calls for  
why film a movie and then look at it later and say   no  i changed my mind  i dont like the ending  
youre fired  
lets get someone else to do it  
 i suppose honor is dead in hollywood  
the end of the film is  of course  hollywoodized  
which is to say that its happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize  
in this case  as is most victories in hollywood movies  gibsons prize is a blond and money  
i miss originality in film  i really do  
i think audiences are so starved for it that theyll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original  
paybacks tagline  get ready to root for the bad guy  promised an original idea  but it was far from the truth  
while gibsons character certainly broke the law  he was a character that had honor  odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it   wouldnt kill in front of children and protects his blond woman  
theres nothing bad about him  hes a hollywood character  a person who could never exist in real life  
and gibson knows it  he spends his time trying to act like a  bad guy   and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant  
the story involves gibson being doublecrossed by his partner  who is a real bad guy  which made me wish that we could root for him  over     
gibson recovers from multiple gunshots  is pissed  naturally   and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back  no more  no less  
he makes a point of it that its strictly  grand  
a real bad guy would have made his expartner pay  interest  
this idea is completely stretched out  
gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with  
what i didnt understand  this is the chicago mafia  
   is like spare change to them  
theyd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him  
i think theyd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple     
maybe im being too hard on the movie  
perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie  
i read roger eberts review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy  
thats why were allowed to root for him  
and its true  gibson walks the movie as if hes smiling at a joke he just heard  
but hes wrong here  
i wanted a lee marvin or oldtime clint eastwood or somebody who wasnt a comic  just an ass kicker  
as a side note  ive just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the th person to post a newsgroup review of payback  
after this many reviews  why would anyone want to read this  
really  i dont care  
im just trying to gain membership into the online film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can
