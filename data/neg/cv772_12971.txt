it happens every year  the days get longer  the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their bigbudget blockbusters  
this years crop already seems inferior to that of past summers  even s lackluster trio of batman  robin  the fifth element and the lost world  
the marketing blitz in  has been centered on godzilla   heeere  leezerd  leezerd       which doesnt make me optimistic about future summers  
godzilla is  of course  based on a series of cult movies  translation  really bad movies only a few people can tolerate  from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turnerowned cable stations  
that this bigbudget remake wont rise above its roots is fairly obvious  
the credits show us the origin of godzilla  
in five words  nuclear explosion creates giant lizard  
sounds like an enquirer headline  doesnt it  
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable  discovery  sequence  
this time  a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling  if that aint a stereotype     
when he discovers the telltale radar blip  
people die  
cut to our protagonist  played by matthew broderick  
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones  warbling along to  singin in the rain   
its a nonetoosubtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie  
no dice  bueller  
from the beginning  poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzillas enormous footprint  
every disaster movie has to have a knowitall scientist  and this time broderick is it  
as the worlds leading expert on radiated earthworms  and wouldnt you love to have that printed on your business card    
broderick is invaluable to the government  
he immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because  hey  you cant take seriously the intellectual arguments of  newsradio  cast members  
broderick instead hits the nail on the head  announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard  
  the radiation isnt an anamoly   he announces  and lightning strikes  
  i believe this is a mutated abberation   he continues  and lightning strikes again  
its vocabulary lightning  you see  activated by words of four syllables or more  
meanwhile  were introduced to our new york cast  headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist  maria patillo   brodericks former love  
gee  what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time  
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer  
italian cameraman hank azaria tells her shes not ruthless enough   nice doesnt get you anywhere in this town  
its dog eat dog   
actually  its lizard eat city  as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apples core  
the filmmakers provide us with a onenote drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla  
  i think ive got a bite   he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him  
you can guess what happens next  
similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city  
hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps  one new yorker remarks   please dont tell me thats another parade   
please dont tell me thats the best line you could come up with  
mayor ebert is not pleased  
played by the principal from  head of the class   he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option  and bickers with his assistant gene  
i guess the filmmakers knew theyd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didnt even bother to kiss ass  
the problem is  if youre going to attack siskel and ebert  you should at least make it funny  
dialogue like   didnt we agree that we werent going to have any sweets until after the election   
followed by   back off  gene   just doesnt work for me  
other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick characters last name and frenchman jean renos inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york  
theres even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses  
as the beast heads back into hiding  broderick suggests the military lure it out with food  
cue twelve dump trucks  all dropping fish into a new york intersection  
  broderick  thats a lot of fish   
that ambush fails  but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying  worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them  
yep  godzillas with children  which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla  
thats until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually  like linda tripp  
godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day  so it has a lot of dumb action scenes  destructive special effects and shallow subplots  
look no further than patillos betrayal of broderick  patillo  what have i done  animal  
what have i become   and the climactic  godzillas nest  sequence in madison square garden  
the main difference is  independence day was about the experience  
it had a real global  patriotic element to it  and some genuinely fun characters  
godzilla has lots of rain and lightning  reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak  blockbuster  juicy fruit  swatch  sprint and bumble bee tuna  
yes  bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla  
that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie
