i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews  and in both instances  he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  
now  i personally remember those films as a  starring a major motion picture star b  being funny c  having great action sequences d  great chemistry e  decent character development  
hmmm     okay    now on to my review of chill factor  
plot  a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an exarmy general  to propose a nuclear device to international prospects  
when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps  they must keep it cool on ice  and rush it over to an army base  before the contraption ticks over  degrees fahrenheit  and kills millions of people  
critique   speed on an icecream truck  is probably the pitch that was used to sell this onetone movie to its backers  but unfortunately  the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tensionfilled  original two hours of cinema  is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film  and the lethal weapon movies  stood for  
this film is seasoned in cliches  with plenty of badly written dialogue  over the top acting from cuba gooding jr   zero chemistry between the two leads  and horribly tacky bad guys  tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe  
my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent  because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously  written   that we just had to crack up  
that  and the formula for the films script which followed the proverbial   and you guessed it     scenario  
and what about all those catchy  hip names to get us to relate to the characters      elvis  
and  nighshift   oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters  and yes  it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel   
it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr  got involved in this oneweekoldbluecheesesmelling project  
did they actually think that it would boost their careers  or did they know that the script sucked  but discounted any fall from grace  knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall  
most probably the latter  
have you seen either fled or bulletproof  
well  despite the slight differences in plot  the essentials are basically the same here  
you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people  having no choice but to work together to get somewhere  hating each other at first  but over time  learning to respect one another as individuals  
yawn  
add to that  the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black  drive black cars and black vans  and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head  
not too conspicuous  eh  
call me a partypooper  but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy  this film just doesnt even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining  
one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside  and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island  do not a fun  buddyaction flick make  
show cuba the money  everybody
