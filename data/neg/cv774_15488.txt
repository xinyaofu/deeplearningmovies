it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part  on the day that one of its stars  roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of   
mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood  having a career that spanned over  years and appearing in more than  films  
fright night part  probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles  
this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was  
william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us  
  at least in the movies anyway   
it has been several years since charlie brewster  ragsdale  and bmovie actor turned late night horror film host  peter vincent  mcdowall  came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlies next door neighbor  
charlie and peter won that battle  but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family  
apparently charlies former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling  
so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge  
this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again  
one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlies stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood  
fright night part  tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort  
while they are stylish  the vamps in this film just dont have the personality of the undead in the first film  
with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes  
one bright spot  speaking from a strictly sexist point of view  is traci lin  who plays charlies very skeptical girlfriend  
its really a shame that her career hasnt been better since she made this film  
ragsdale does a fair job in this film  but doesnt give nearly the performance that he did in the original  
roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given  which unfortunately isnt much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie  
i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way  
the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner  part  had more of the feel of a music video  
never a good thing for a horror film  
another minus for part  was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare  
for that matter  they were almost nonexistent  
if i was going to watch a horror film  this would be far from my first choice  
the first fright night  on the other hand  would be right up near the top of my list  
if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film id probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes  
either way fright night part  would most likely not enter into the equation
