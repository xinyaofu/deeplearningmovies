sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things  and  pushing tin  certainly features some name stars who are going places  billy bob thornton  cate blanchett  angelina jolie  and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first  but hes actually the  veteran  among this quartet of finelooking people  
sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has  hip comedy  written all over it  compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction  compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits  compensate for clich  d characterizations  compensate for embarrassing  you have to be joking  situations  
etc  
in  pushing tin   thornton  blanchett  jolie  and cusack dont have an earthly  
from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble  squiggly   quirky  credits  fakelooking passenger planes circling new york  and anne dudleys inyourear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for  the full monty   let alone won it  
but i  for one  wasnt ready to walk just yet  
so quickly we descend into a tightlyedited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job  yes  what with their frantic  mileaminute instructional personas  juggling planes and passengers lives like some huge  real  midair video game  
hip  cool  demonic auctioneer nick  the zone  falzone  cusack  is the best in the biz  
of course  
until some hipper  cooler  leatherclad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell  thornton  shows up to challenge falzones finite air space  
boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding  then the macho oneupmanship begins  
it doesnt stop with seeing who can juggle three s within a cats whisker of each other  
oh no  
there are some broken hoop dreams  some wannaseehowfasticandrives  and then the ultimate showdown  was that my wife i saw you with last night  
director mike newell   four weddings and a funeral   must have read a different draft of this script because the one thats being acted out up there between newark  jfk  and la guardia doesnt have an ounce of subtlety  and newell has made some awfully goodand funnymovies before  
the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe  
theyll make you frown in disbelief  
theyll have you constantly looking at your watch  
but wait  
theres still  minutes to go   
the films only saving grace is blanchett  whose connie falzone is a spunky  brash  long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes  
this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a redheaded australian gambler   oscar and lucinda   and a tempestuous british monarch   elizabeth    
but shes not enough to save the picture  
thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke  
jolie  as russells knock em dead wife  isnt bad  but the upandcoming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything  
cusack cracks gum  dons shades  and acts hip throughout but  like everything else in the film  his performance is forced  
in the last ten minutes or so  for some inexplicable reason  things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been  like the trailer teases  
but its too little too late  
a fine cast aside   pushing tin  is nothing more than an embarrassment
