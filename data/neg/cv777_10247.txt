when walt disney pictures announced a liveaction feature based on the s cartoon series of  mr  magoo   special interests groups representing the visionimpaired let out a cry of dismay  
mr  
magoo  they claimed  would be an insult to the men and women they represented  
in fact  they were wrong  
mr  
magoo is not just an insult to the blind and nearblind  its an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny   minute atrocity  
its stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas  
look at their roster of  and  releases  and youll see a shocking list of retreads  including  dalmatians  george of the jungle  junglejungle  that darn cat   flubber  and now mr  
magoo  
the best of these  george of the jungle  was mildly entertaining  
the worst  mr  
magoo  exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be  
the first problem with mr  
magoo is the script  
despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft  mr  
magoo is comically barren  
from beginning to end  theres not a laugh to be found  
every attempt at humor  and there are lots of them  falls flat with an audible thud  
youd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film  at least a few would work  but thats not the case  
ive had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures  
then theres leslie nielsen  who looks  sounds  and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character  memorably voiced by jim backus   
in the past  nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun  
lately  however  he has been getting lazy  taking parts in the likes of dracula  dead and loving it  spy hard  and mr  
magoo  
even if nielsen was in top form  it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo  especially since were reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film   but  top form  is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here  
this is strictly a takethemoneyand run operation  
the story  which  like many disney stories  can be described in one long sentence  magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum  and  as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own  the police mistake him for the robber  
the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky  who take their lumps early and often  
the bad guys are kelly lynch  who does a lot of martial artstype kicking   nick chinlund  and malcolm mcdowell  who has the good sense to look embarrassed   
matt keeslar portrays one of magoos sidekicks  his nephew  waldo  
the bumbling mans other  more interesting companion is a dog named angus  
most of mr  
magoos humor comes in the form of failed slapstick  
the cartoon violence level in this film doesnt approach that of home alone  or flubber  but its still pretty acute  with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices  
theres a nonviolent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better  but  compared to mr  beans recent  similar misadventure  it doesnt hold up well  
then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoos near blindness  such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby  
im willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack  
tong  a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market  has helmed several jackie chan movies  including first strike  rumble in the bronx  and supercop  
his chief talent  that of choreographing martial arts fights  is wasted here  despite some high kicking by kelly lynch   
like john woo  hard target  and ringo lam  maximum risk  before him  it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream  
it is worth noting that  unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under crowd while driving parents to distraction  mr  
magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages  
the screening i attended was walltowall kids  and  for the most part  they didnt seem to be enjoying themselves  
when the film was over  i asked one little girl what she thought of it  
her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words  
mr  
magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer  sight unseen
