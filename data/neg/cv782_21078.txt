in  the th warrior   arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan  antonio banderas  finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the kings old lady  
with his translator  screen legend omar sharif in a small role   ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen  vikings   
he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king  
a messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance  
a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons  twelve northmen and one outsider  
thus  ahmed becomes the  th warrior   
on the trip  ahmed manages to learn the vikings language by listening to their fireside conversations  
a bit farfetched  its true  but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting  
ahmed  whos called  ibn  by the vikings  forms friendships with herger the joyous  dennis storh  i  and the viking leader buliwyf  vladimir kulich   
when they arrive in the other kingdom  the thirteen warriors discover that theyre facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves  
hereafter  most of the movie is battle scenes  the cannibals attack the vikings  the vikings attack the cannibals  the cannibals attack the  
  
  
well  you get the idea  
just to add some action  theres also a viking vs  viking duel  
other movies insert scenes between the fights  these scenes are called character development  
i suspect that  the th warrior  had a better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tagteam direction  
the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan  youll notice a lot of similarities between  warrior  and mctiernans  predator   including the chittering jungle sounds   
somewhere along the line  mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over  
crichton  whose novel  eaters of the dead  is the basis for  warrior   has directed a small assortment of goofy sciencefiction  thrillers    westworld    coma    looker    runaway   
their result of their consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie  
perhaps what  the th warrior  needs more than anything else is a villain  
the  eaters of the dead  are a faceless mob in blackface  
they have no personality  and by the end they dont even seem particularly threatening  
the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression  
mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain  it was his  die hard  that made villains seem fun and attracted bigname stars to the evil roles in action films  
  the th warrior  suffers from a lack of vision  
it wants to be  predator  meets  braveheart  meets  the magnificent seven  meets  dances with wolves   
with so many competing goals  all it can do is echo what it might have been  
it might have been a satisfying action film  
it might have been a beautifullyrendered medieval epic  
it might have been a thoughtprovoking examination of the meeting of cultures  
what a shame it turned out to be nothing in particular  
bottom line  if you want to see antonio swing his sword  rent  the mask of zorro
