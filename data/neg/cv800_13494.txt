there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of  scream queen  in the early s  
two of them were halloween movies  but the other two  prom night and terror train  were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween  
the same  god  im scared  theres some guy in a mask coming after me  routine she did in john carpenters classic  jamie lee copies here  with none of the urgency or suspense  
terror train takes place on  where else   a train  charted by some premed students finishing their first four years of higher education  
most of them wont make it to med school  though  and its obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains   i wish to hell theyd put a radio on that train   
the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone  even jamie lee  
from the beginning  hes talking his head off  he tells one of his coworkers  think on this  whens the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station   
as if it makes any kind of sense  and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles  
of course  the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body  which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it  
i forgot to mention the prologue  
its a party three years earlier  with the same group of students  
two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge  promising him hes going to get laid  
they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in  noticing a form on the bed  
she says   kiss me  kenny   and he kisses the body on the bed  which happens to be a cadaver  
   oh my god  they killed kenny  
you bastards    
its a sick trick  and one jamie lee wasnt let in on  
she still hasnt forgiven the guy as they board the terror train   you asshole  you cant have a good time without hurting somebody     
the killing starts before the train even leaves the station  
since its new years  everyones wearing disguises  a convenient plot device weve seen before   and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no ones looking  
at least one of the characters says its a groucho mask  when the killer dons it and steps aboard  it looks like gene shalit who  by the way  would make a great killer in a slasher movie  
speaking of weirdlooking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene  one of terror trains most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield  as the magician   who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music  
then theres his greatest trick  getting laid with hair that looks like that  
for all its attempts at visual style and substance  terror train is more lionel than amtrak  more prom night than halloween  and nothing really worth watching  
only diehard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield  if he truly has any fans  should even attempt to watch it  
and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse  
i mean  when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station  anyway  
terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car
