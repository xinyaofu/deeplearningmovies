note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
its rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylors first feature film  dream with the fishes  when the plodding  tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup  
any hopeful expectations  however  are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatchedbuddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the films latter half  
the films central characters are terry  david arquette   a depressed  lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident  and nick  brad hunt   a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill  
nick lives in the apartment building across from terry  who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz  kathryn erbe  with his trusty set of binoculars  but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a halfdrunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge  unconvincingly vowing suicide  
nick casually asks for terrys wristwatch  and eventually cons terry into a trade  the watch for a bottle of pills  
of course  terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects  and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch  
learning of nicks condition  he only has a handful of weeks left   terrys compassion kicks in  and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement  terry will agree to bankroll the dying nicks lifelong fantasies  and nick will fulfill terrys death wish by killing him  
this is a promising premise  and mr  taylors film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point  but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters  terry is a repessed  mournful character who wants to die  while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live  and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits  and where the straightlaced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character  
this is bythenumbers plotting  buddy movieroad movie redux  
however  dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline  but by the characters which carry the story  it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic  if not likeable  
unfortunately  that is not the case here  where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying  giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights  and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits  
far from a romp  this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt  and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond  
mr  taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes  while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone  it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived  witness such lines as  you should have asked something more interesting  like do you enjoy the pain   
 see  thats provocative  leaves room for further questions    
the film enjoys a few inspired moments  the urn scene  a session of nude bowling  the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip  but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between  and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes  
this occurs particularly often during the films opening sequence  as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital  im realising that this is  intended  to be funny  although nary a smile crept upon my lips  which is probably due to the obvious fact that its painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts  sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nicks scheme of tricking him  this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes  
the entire sequence is  then  clearly an exercise for character exposition  with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability  
among the cast  coming off best is david arquette  the current master in the portrayal of meek  squirming  stammering freshfaced characters  he would have been terrific as the lead for george huangs swimming with sharks  who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry  
mr  taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique  where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated  as opposed to a bright  crisp look for the smalltown scenes  
the charge of dream with the fishess protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me  i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters  and indeed  in many cases have i been in the minority  supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult  audienceunfriendly nature of their characters  
for dream with the fishes  though  i did find myself on the flip side of coin  often hoping that the film would quickly conclude  and that the nick character would just hurry up and die
