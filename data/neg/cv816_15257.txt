it seems like im reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now  
scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground againthe serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the  relentless  department  
i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects  but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend  its citizen hook  
jennifer lovehewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie jameswho apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by    waking 
up  
she lives in fear of ben willis  the vengeful fishermanvictim of a hit and run by julie and her pals  
paranoid and beat  she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla  norwood   winner of the local radio stations th of july getaway giveaway  
bikiniready julie invites boyfriend ray  prinze  jr    whoand heres the movies biggest mysteryturns her down  but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before takeoff  
until he gets a roadside visit from captain hellliner himself  that is  
unaware of this and feeling shunned  julie goes on vacation  anyway  with karla  karlas boyfriend  pfeiffer   and will  matthew settle   a real boynextdoor type whos sweet on julie  
to make a long story shorti cant believe it took a paragraph to describe the setup for this gratuitous sequelthe trip is a disaster  
not only is it storm season  not only is the desk clerk  the frighteners jeffrey combs  a jerk  not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis onebyone  but the karaoke machine isnt working properly  
  you think killing is hard  
try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynors  i will survive  now contains the lyric  i still know what you did last summer    
all is not lostray is on his way to save the day  and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co  
this picture is really about breasts  two of them  
julie  like a good horror heroine  never does up her shirt to the collar  always wears white in the rain  and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan  
based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie  i cant imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to mehe gets jennifer lovehewitt  and my generation got heather langenkamp  
lucky bastard  
i didnt like i know what you did last summer and i cant say i liked this continuation any more or less  
the pacing in both films is languidhow is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development  
i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one  though  and at least it explains away williss random selection of victims  
  i dont think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer   
director cannon  judge dredd  is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative oneif there is a part three  what on earth would they call it    and the fun denouement suggests there will be  heres my suggestion  hire a filmmaker with flair  someone who can really energize this stillborn seriessomeone who wont rely on so many shock notes  
and let that person run wild with the camera  
  aside  if blandy sic must appear in the next one  try to keep the number of times she says  baby  to a minimum  
thanks in advance
