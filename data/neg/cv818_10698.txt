ok  i admit iti find camp amusement with the spice girls  
yes  the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual  identities   they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of  girl power   
but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isnt enough to carry their big screen debut  a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world  
the film begins amusingly enough  with a cheeky esque title sequence in which the british quintet  scary   melanie brown    baby   emma bunton    sporty   melanie chisolm    ginger   geri halliwell   and  posh   victoria adams  are introduced one by one  to  much to my surprise  excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience  as they croon the silky ballad  too much   a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film   
a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film     the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at londons royal albert hall     a film producer  george wendt  and a screenwriter  mark mckinney  pitch various film ideas to the girls manager  clifford  richard e  grant      a documentary film crew follows the girls     a pregnant  mate   naoki mori  of the group rapidly approaches her due date  and    a tabloid publisher  barry humphries  attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug  richard obrien   
capped off by a live rendition of the girls bouncy hit  say youll be there   a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow  right  
wrong  its all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches  
i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves  but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them  much less a organized framework for all the  wacky  goingson  
spice world jumps from vignette to vignette  subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense  at one minute having the girls meet with aliens  no joke  and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride  
while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and thereduring a  dance bootcamp  scene  the girls sing the lyric  we know how we got this farstrength and courage and a wonderbra  much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level  
some gags are just plain pointless  such as roger moores recurring role as the mysterious chief  who dispenses cryptic  metaphorheavy advice to clifford  
the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond  
ha ha  
as weak as the script is  i think theres one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie  and that is the girls themselves  
the point is not that they cant act  and  for the record  they really cant  but that their individual personas  which works as a gimmick over the span of a fourminute music video  are too thin to survive outside of the truncated  video bite mtv world  
posh  who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions  comes off best by default because her persona  rich bitch  most easily translates into character in a film  
babys persona  young innocent   to a lesser extent  also works  but the remaining girls identities are a little harder to flesh out  
there really isnt much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often  which is exactly what fuller and spiers do   and  after all  what exactly entails being  ginger  or  scary   
apparently  just their wardrobes  
spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices signature hit   wannabe   
the song is as grating as ever  but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a muchneeded shot in the arm  setting the stage for a wave of selfreferential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas  the film almost mirrors robert altmans the player in the way the film snails into itself   
this section of the film  involving all manner of derringdo involving a speeding bus  is perhaps its most effective  but it also points up how all the other storylines  the publisher  the documentary crew  lack a satisfactory payoff  
spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family  and it will please the spice faithful  
but this sloppy enterprise surely wont win them any new fans  which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states  
once the hype disappears  spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america
