its difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of  awardwinning  tv commercials  as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes  
that said  hayess feature film debut lives up to expectations  coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic  
but occasionally  bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary  
those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the films two stars  jake gyllenhall as the immunodeficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his overprotective  hyper religious  reaganloving mother  
gyllenhalls sweetnatured delivery of jimmys hilariously na  ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy comingofage story  jimmy is a bubble boy  a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ  a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld  
his mom homeschools jimmy  filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and antisexual messages  until hes befriended by chloe  marley shelton   the beautiful girl next door  
jimmy falls in love with chloe  but is afraid that his love will literally kill him  as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss  
but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend  jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinksaddled crosscountry voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love  
the offensive bits have little to do with jimmys rare handicap  regardless of what the films protesters would have you believe   but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes  including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi  
but even if you find stereotype humor funny  its hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags  
they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks  
but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work  especially in the case of kurtz  who very bluntly shows the dark  hypocritical side of the religious right  and a wacky sendup of a cult called  bright n shiny   led by the inimitable fabio  
unfortunately  a few giggles cant make bubble boy the riotous  offthewall comedy it so desperately wants to be  
honestly  its a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made  and im not just saying that because its so mediocre  
how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesnt seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many  
and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of reallife bubble boy david philip vetter  maybe disneys wondering the same thing  
hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile
