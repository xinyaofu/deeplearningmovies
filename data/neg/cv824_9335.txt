toward the bottom of the s action movie barrel lies action jackson  the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes  
this carl  apollo creed  weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs  evil establishment crook  and relies on all the s trappings  from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer  
somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs  although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs  
weathers is action jackson  a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques  
speaking of one past criminal apprehension  jacksons superior yells   you tore his arm off   
jackson replies   he had a spare   
jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane  craig t  nelson  and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson  
after hearing what jackson thinks of him  stone says   i take it youre not one of dellaplanes friends   
  not unless they changed the definition   jackson glowers  
and of course it turns out stone is mrs  dellaplane  
faux pas  jackson    
not everything is happy in motown  people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa  
its all up to jackson to stop it  and his only lead lies in vanity  not his own   
wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson  
she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplanes nightclub  
after singing one particularly sultry number for him  she saunters over and complains   i expected a standing ovation   
he responds   youre getting one   and its damn clever because hes sitting down at the time  
prince wouldnt even let out an innuendo that lame and hes the king of the horndogs    
or at least the prince  
its a testament to the s that sharon stone is killed off within the first  minutes but vanity survives the whole movie  
action jackson is another variation on the  unlikely partners  buddy action flick  with jackson lugging junkie vanity around  
this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade  and with the dialogue theyre given  theres not much room for improvement  
my favorite is when vanity  feeling the effects of drug withdrawal  says   i feel like my teeth are hollow  my gums are made of dry rubber and someones trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head   
jacksons response is   i think i felt that way once  
they called it love   
youll understand when i say watch this at your own risk  
serving the world for nearly th of a century
