the best thing about   lake placid  is that its only  minutes long and when its over youre glad that you didnt waste more than an hour and a half of your time  
its nothing more than a bad ripoff of   jaws   and i think thats being kind   
it was written by david e  kelly   ally mcbeal   as a horrorcomedy but fails at both  miserably  
i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once  
the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in   anaconda   
the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine  
that brings the local sheriff  brendan gleeson  and a fishandgame warden  bill pulman  to investigate  
also  a paleontologist  bridget fonda  from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionairecrocodile lover  oliver platt  flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast  
soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it  
theres also an eccentric old lady  betty white  who lives by the lake and has a few secrets  
as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor  h  dont go for a serious approach towards the material but they also dont have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either  
the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting  theyre all basically idiots  
if they had any brains the croc wouldnt have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldnt have put themselves in half of the situations that they did  
but then again  if they were smart there wouldnt be a movie  
basically   lake placid  is best undiscovered
