i had an epiphany today  
it occurred to me while i was watching  house on haunted hill   
it is as follows  if a trailer makes the film its advertising look like a trashy  stupid movie  well guess what  
chances are  there  is  truth in advertising  
too bad i didnt trust my own instincts when somethingortheother possessed me to see this movie  
i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of  sleepy hollow   
that and  dogma  started too late in the afternoon for my schedule  
an hour of  angel  or  buffy  is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face  
i wish id seen it when it was halloween  
at least i would have been forgiving  
hey  tis the season  
the movie was scary  albeit very confusing  dizzying  and nauseating  at first  but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasnt going anywhere  
now i truly appreciate films like  scream    halloween   or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic  
thats what spooks people out  the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know  
there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with  
sure  utterly unpredictable is good  too  but thats different from utterly nonsensical  
hohh  house on haunted hill   on the other hand  
  
  
well lets just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they ohsocleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago  
riiiiight  
yknow  that just sends chills down my spine  
yeah  
just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil  
ooooooo  
hint  blood and guts only work a few times  
sooner or later people start to tell themselves that its just ketchup and props and youve got to come up with something better than that  
there were just too many things in this movie that weve all seen before  from the inevitable  plot developments  of strangers unwittingly trapped together  strangers turning against each other  the evil manifesting itself  the dead coming back for a last scare  
each was more predictable than the last  
why didnt these fools just stay together in one place anyways  
sheesh  
was i grossed out  
yes  
did i get spooked a few times  
yes  
but why  
i get really disturbed when there is no why  
when there werent random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect  which wasnt that good either  trust me  and the scare  the film was filled with drab  laughable dialogue  
the characters were incredibly flat and cliched  
not to mention downright annoying  
youve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives  of course theyre dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night  
jeez  i thought no one fell for those  you may already be a winner  things anymore  
and of course  all three gals are babes  
i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of  shine  ended up in this movie  
keep that up  geoff  and youll qualify for the next batman venture  
the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because  well  he just cracks me up  
and famke jansen  sp   
because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan  
pierce brosnan  hey  i willingly endured  dantes peak  three times for him    
all right  i concede  
there were a couple of things i enjoyed  
that perverted little amusement park at the beginning  
i probably wont ride a rollercoaster for a while  
and the machine they used to drive geoffreys character mad  see  i dont even remember their names   
the machine  not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it  
i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie  
it wouldnt have redeemed the film  but at least it would have made me feel better  
but no  they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending  
thank god they didnt add a kiss at the end or i would have puked  
god  there is no hope
