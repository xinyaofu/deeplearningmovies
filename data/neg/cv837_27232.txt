a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous th century french poets  
the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities  
the result is merely an academic exercise  leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldnt build on to show them as the poets they were  
on paper  this shouldnt have been so terrible  it had a talented director in agnieszka holland   the secret garden    a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton  dangerous liaisons   and a capable cast  
but the film was done in by its inept script  the unappealing way the film was directed  and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud  
i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film  with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius  spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade  
he  especially  looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be  
but when the two of them were together  it looked like a mismatch  
leonardos rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude  yet we know from rimbauds poetry  that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring  
the film opens in postrevolutionary france in   the yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems  
he accepts verlaines praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home  and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville  
once there  rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household  has an immediate conflict with verlaines busty yearold wife mathilde  romane   and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her familys money  even though he has nothing else in common with her  
when verlaine states   poets can learn from one another   rimbaud replies in a haughty tone   only if theyre bad poets   
he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship  
verlaine proves to be weakwilled  beating his wife regularly  and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud  
when mathildes father kicks rimbaud out of the house  verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers  
its a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets  which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce  
in brussels  verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail  
while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes   
he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gunrunner  and after ten years there  comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of   
the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying  
the film ends on a whimper    with 
verlaine talking with rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses  which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published  
this film was especially annoying because rimbauds poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film  as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry  
i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film  but whatever it was  it just didnt work  
it certainly didnt bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry
