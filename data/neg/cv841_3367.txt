a movie about divorce and custody in  seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings  
family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years  and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in handwringing detail  
still  i cant recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love  
and after it  i still cant  
bye bye love is rarely funny  more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tvmovie fare  
only a few moments which have nothing to do with the films main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion  
bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children  
dave  matthew modine   a father of two  is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend  vic  randy quaid  is a foulhumored father of three about to go on a rare date  donny  paul reiser  pines for his exwife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma  eliza dushku   
over the course of the weekend  the three men face various crises  including vics blind date from hell  janeane garofolo  and donnys growing estrangement from emma  
the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo  and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality  
randy quaid is the best of the three  bitter without being irritating  gleefully spiteful without being frightening  
his runins with is exwife  lindsey crouse  are a bit overplayed  though  and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist  rob reiner  is gimmicky and implausible  
he does get bye bye loves best subplot  a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo  and he does a great slow burn  
paul reiser really has only one character  his slightly befuddled  uptight nice guy  mad about you  persona  but he does it well  
as a personality  he is appealing  but as a character  he becomes pretty boring here  
matthew modine  is  quite simply  terrible  
this isnt a performance good enough to be called mailedin  he even forgot to put a stamp on it  
modine lacks any charm in an appallingly underwritten role  looks bored most of the time  and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how its all his fathers fault hes such a cad  
carolcos executives  whose entire future is resting on modines bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island  must be sweating buckets right now  
bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie  because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids  making it just another  dating in the s  movie  
when the movie does deal with the children at all  it is to have one of them scream out an accusation andor cry  perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug  perhaps not  
even more confusing is a subplot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonalds and befriends a troubled youth  
it is a sad end to flanders career  getting caught up in a truly annoying overuse of mcdonalds as a location  a plot device and  apparently  a major advertiser  
even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parentchild relationships  it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off  because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family breakups and their effects on children  
any way you slice it  it is a bad situation for kids  and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue  
it is left to the dads romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is  and it isnt enough  
there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood  but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching  
bye bye love is a genuine shame
