according to the publicity material  with this movie the directors  hope to restore good oldfashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness   
hmm  
you never know  they just might be on to something  
what with the rise of geek chic  lounge music and seventies fashion  the evercontrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own  
but then  i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it  
its cheesy all right  but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch  
thats a shame  because  in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more  
woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise  roy munson  
the movie opens in the fifties with roys dad dishing out the readers digestgumpian wisdom in scoopfuls  shifting to the s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever  
the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray  as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken  
its thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good  he gives the wry  derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy  
mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job  then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roys hand  
then its fast forward  years later when munson is a fat  balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand  
hes hopeless until he meets ishmael  randy quaid   an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege  
so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno  picking up pretty hustler claudia  vanessa angel  on the way  
with the exit of bill murray  the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go  and thats    
dumb and dumber  
yes  indeed  kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour  peter and bobby farrelly  the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle  
so  prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands  distended nipples  ridiculous hair and bull semen  
get set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community  or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking  striptease and unchristian neighboursocking  
now  dont get me wrong  theres nothing wrong with cheap humour  and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy  
the trouble is that these jokes arent bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction  
it lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama   pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal  and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack   never quite getting it all together  
some gags fall flat from a lack of buildup  while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply dont do anything  
why the long  unfunny fight in the car park  
why two of these  
why does that guy wear mascara  or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it  
the film is full of these halfthoughtthrough ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer  grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying   wouldnt that be funny    
well  no  actually  
the actors dont do the movie much favours either  
woody harrelson comes off okay  plausibly acting dumb  smart  cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it  but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham  and vanessa angel has no talent  like schwarzenegger  she seems more convincing playing a computercreation than a human  take the tv series weird science    please 
   
even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movies climax  
all in all  a fairly useless attempt at comedy  and a certified nohoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance  
well have to look to a reinspired john waters  or perhaps somebody from down under   strictly bowling   anyone   for the definitive bowling comedy  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
