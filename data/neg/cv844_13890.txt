synopsis  in  sooner than you think  america  the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad  a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs  
a dangerous criminal  however  attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them  
comments  so  what do an exgangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop  a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem  and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common  
why  theyre all members of blade squad  an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms  rollerblades  and jetpacks  
they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james camerons aliens  
yes  its blade squad  the fox networks wednesday night movie of the week  
this  movie   marking its dubious world premiere today  curiously has a number of guest stars  
  how can a movie have guest stars   
you may ask  
well  blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a  hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie  
blade squad is dumb  
blade squad is loud  
blade squad is obnoxious  
blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a longlived tv series  
why not  
after all  television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars   knight rider    fast helicopters   airwolf    and super fast motorcycles   street hawk    and viewers have eaten it up in the past  
so  why not crimefighters with jetpowered roller blades  
to be honest  as a madefortv presentation  blade squad is at least watchable  
the film has a relatively large cast of characters  a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script  and enough action sequences to keep one halfinterested  
id imagine adolescent males  probably the target audience of this turkey  would get a kick out of it  
i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad  
i can remember liking  airwolf  and  street hawk  when i was  or   
and  although this isnt saying much  blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on  the insipidly awful generation x  a huge disappointment considering the comic books terrific twoyear beginning   
but  i digress  
despite its limited appeal  blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series  
one  it suffers from mtv syndrome  a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewers senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background  
oh yeah  dylans  knockin on heavens door  and bowies  im afraid of americans  are used here  in rather poor taste  
two  blade squad needs a new crew for the sound  
the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end  
characters dialogue  at times  sounded choppy and unintelligible  
during one important scene  a song played loudly in the background  
when a character spoke  the songs volume dropped but did not disappear  
as soon as that character finished speaking  the songs volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke  
this sounds trivial  im sure  but it distracted me immensely  
finally  this is commercial television  
foul language is not allowed  typically  on commercial television  
thus  dont use foul language in a madefortv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner  
in an early scene of the film  for example  the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets  
when the good guy spouts out a bad word  a driver conveniently honks his cars horn offscreen to muffle the word out  
in a  seinfeld  episode  this technique proved funny  here  it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably  
perhaps future writers  if a show is spun out of the movie  could take a cue from marvel comics  series of comics  
make up a bunch of new bad words for the future  
this way  you dont need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language  
compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies  blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp  
when compared to  say  a movie studio film  blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials  bs
