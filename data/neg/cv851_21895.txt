dont get me wrong  i tend to appreciate bessons naive  unashamedly romantic worldview  an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood  
his  leon is exciting and absurdly moving  thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman  and s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love  luv  thats even more of a hoot on repeated viewings  
but his joan of arc is a mess  despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a closecropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself  
jovovich  bessons own personal muse through the making of his last two films  though theyve since separated   is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan  as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior  but also a fabulous  supermodellevel babe   
and besson remains a servicable action film director  though not an especially facile one  
leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english  joans struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring  and besson helps you understand how the french could believe  fervently  that god is on her side  
bessons big mistake  i think  is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject  
yes  joan had visions  but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blueeyed christ figure on display in bessons hallucinatory dream sequences  
the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman  billed as  the conscience   shows up  spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell  babbling like ally mcbeal  
thats kind of a shame  since she does quite well up to that point  charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness  
that darkly attractive aspect of her character  that shes as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord  is more or less betrayed by the final reels  in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing shes overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady whos about to take a fall  
as the story winds down  with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire  besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance  
trouble is  hes chosen a lurid  often jokey tone for the balance of the picture  including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes  and its impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is  to a great extent  nothing more than a puton  
this glib  prefab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyers the passion of joan of arc     a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joans trial  and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema  
compared to that film  the messenger plays as a crime against history
