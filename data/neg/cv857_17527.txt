claire danes  giovanni ribisi  and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists  but theyre just about the only palatable element of the mod squad  a lamebrained bigscreen version of the s tv show  
the story has all the originality of a block of wood  well  it would if you could decipher it   the characters are all blank slates  and scott silvers perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come  
by sheer force of talent  the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever theyre on screen  but the mod squad is just a secondrate action picture with a firstrate cast
