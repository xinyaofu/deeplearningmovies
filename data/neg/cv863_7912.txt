to put it bluntly  ed wood would have been proud of this  
a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor  hokey drama  zero logic and a crap screenplay  
also  a beautifully anticlimactic ending  
not to say it didnt look intriguing when i saw the previews  
so much for truth in advertising  
roland emmerich  whos later  independence day  would look like  the  blows  compared to this  cowrited and directed this inane scifi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens  
in a useless opening sequence  men find a stone in  with hieroglyphics on it  
it wouldnt be till present day    till they would actually figure it out  
theyre decipherer  
a slightlyneurotic scientist  nice twist   dr  dan jackson  james spader  doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare  whos life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word  
why do they use him to decipher what no one else could  
so there is a hokey ending  
duh  
he figures it out in about a minute  
yea  
and then they get a suicidal colonel or something   jack  oneill  kurt russel  with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flattop that would make howie long snap into a fetal position   
why a suicidal colonel  
for the ending  
youll get the hang of this  
they open the stargate  a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad  
after an overdone special effects thing  theyre    inside a goddam pyramid  
so they went to egypt  right  
wrong  
theyre on another planet that was filmed in egypt  
they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra  the sun god  the androginous jaye davidson  with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma   and there are fights  explosions and a kiss between two people  
yea  
also melodrama  stupidity  hokey scenes and a bizarre language  
an anticlimactic ending ends with stupid lines   say hello to king tut  asswhole   
 the quintessential line  lemme tell ya  and some convenient pesudopseudopseudocharacter development  
by the end  you just wanna go home and watch  i dont know  the  outer limits  or something  
the scripts terrible  
the special effects are okay  but nothing great  
the storys so weak that its almost opaque  
the whole experience just isnt worth it unless youre so bored that youd consider watching a  full house  marathon    or 
this  
id pick this  obviously  but still  its just not fun at all  
and i cant wait for it to premier on mstk
