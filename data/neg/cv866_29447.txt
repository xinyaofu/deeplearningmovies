making your first feature film aint easy  
assemble a decent  if not  strong cast  as writerdirector robert moresco has done with one eyed king  and youre already ahead of the game  
but rehash old plot lines  tired dialogue  and standard clich  s  and a wellintentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film  
how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse  
the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another  but here we have it  
again  
five irish kids in nycs hells kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop  
with teary music  
and slow motion  
in the films first scene  
the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults  unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen  
leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a goodhearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante  
id like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah  blah  blah  but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points  
hes concerned about buddy jason gedricks heroin abuse  
he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwins characters sister  
he looks into who might be pushing the most moroniclooking counterfeit cash ever made  a genuinely funny touch   
but none of this ever really amounts to anything  
it seems that morescos greater concern is to provide that intangible  slice of life   that flavor of the neighborhood that everyones been trying to evoke since scorseses early work  
so  we get the drunk guys  hugging and singing together at the local bar  to prove to us that they really love each other  
  do people actually do this    
we get a lot of tough street talk  usually mumbled for effect  and a whole lot of the fword  whether it sounds like it fits or not  
we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose  
bruno kirby  chazz palminteri  you know  guys youve seen in movies just like this one before  
assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears  and baldwins performance is adequate  but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that its almost funny  
moresco  a theater guy and sometimes tv writer  including the series falcone   obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child  but the content is probably too personal  
as a result  the movies style is heavyhanded  in need of a considerable amount of toning down  
nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids  moresco reminds us  boy does he remind us  
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene  running in slow motion  complete with dialogue from the present  just in case we dont comprehend the link to the past  
moresco needs to either trust his audiences intelligence  or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it  
his next project should have a little more personal distance  and a lot more subtlety  
if he actually gets that chance
