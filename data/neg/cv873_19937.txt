overblown remake of the  robert wise film of the same name  based on shirley jacksons novel  the haunting of hill house   stars lili taylor as one of three  lab rats  that participate in a supposed  insomnia  study being initiated by liam neeson  
he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it  
he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of  creepy  cgi effects scare the cast and try the audiences patience  
i know this question has been posed before  but why do people keep remaking good movies  
the original was a great psychological horror film  
this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary  
in fact  i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg horror movie that is scary  
unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening  then theres nothing in this film that will raise hackles  
i nearly fell asleep twice during the film  and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didnt seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed  
its sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly  
owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house  and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability  
catherine zetajones  always nice to look at  is given the woefully underwritten role of a bisexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs  
liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about whats going on as the rest of them do  
finally  poor lili taylor  the center of the film  gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her  
apparently  a subplot involving a tryst between zetajones and taylors characters was filmed but removed  
thats too bad  because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative  
this is jan de bonts second straight misfire  speed   cruise control being the first   
when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better  
robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that  
one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset  
if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything  it would have served to make the film terrifying  
what our mind fashions on its own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything  
apparently  yet another version of this story is being filmed under its original title  
i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bonts version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had
