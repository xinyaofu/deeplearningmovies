the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie  complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence  
its not abhorrent  or even blatantly unlikable  but it doesnt make a shred of sense  
and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film  
james foley knows a lot about characters and acting  and those are the strengths of the corruptor  
but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense  and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train  
at least we have chow yunfat in the lead role  
chow plays nick chen  a chinatown cop  
hes a good cop  as the first few scenes establish  and hes very familiar with chinatown  
thats probably why the powersthatbe decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace  mark wahlberg   
nick and danny begin by stepping on each others toes  but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other ones life  
what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me  
im fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons  led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu  byron mann   
im also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee  ric young   a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff  
im not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny  although this makes for some ridiculous  albeit unpredictable  plot twists along the way  
theres also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father  brian cox   but it doesnt have much to do with the main story  
one of the problems  as i said  is that the movie doesnt make any sense  
i dont blame this entirely on foley  because hes obviously a good director  
im more inclined to point my finger at robert puccis script  which doesnt seem to be in tune to the way normal people act  
one scene early on had me particularly annoyed  nick confronts his boss because hes angry about his new white partner  
hes shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture  and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me  
  in addition  the film takes a bite into racerelated issues  and never develops them at all   
there are a lot of scenes like this one  and none of them are very coherent  
theres also a considerable language barrier  given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents  
the plot itself never straightens out  
im not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are  or why henry lee is associated with them  or what they do as a group  
the corruptor is an action movie  and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences  
the sequences arent bad  but theyre not new  how many car chases through chinatown have you seen  
on that note  how many chinatown cop movies have you seen  
one too many  id imagine  
foleys strength is clearly in characterization  and he does a pretty good job here  
the scenes between nick and danny are very good  and i actually got a feel for their characters  a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together  
chow and wahlberg are both good actors  chow is a pro  and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep  
wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere  but hes still fun to watch  
i also liked the subplot involving dannys father  brian coxs performance is powerful  and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny  
but the film ultimately fails  mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overlyfamiliar action scenes  
a complicated plot can be successful  but the story needs to make sense when its over  
the corruptor never manages to make any sense  it just keeps spinning out of control until  finally  theres nothing left to hold on to
