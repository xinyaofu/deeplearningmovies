plot  a downandout girl moves in with some overthetop models and falls in love with a goofybutloveable guy from across the street  
aaaaaaaaah  
then one day  she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat  
ooooooooh  
she must then join together with her modelfriends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofybutloveable  or a psycho killer  
aaaaaaaaah  
critique  completely idiotic  
okay  so maybe im being a little too nice  
this movie starts off dumb  moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy  
there    thats 
more like it  
and how  you may ask  
well  its simple really  
four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world  oh my god  i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life    yipes   
join monica potter  in a role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help  and freddie prinze jr   not the actor  but the character better known as freddie prinze jr    in a plot so stupid and farfetched  that you have to wonder once more  how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs  
this thing stinks to highheaven  
its just plain embarrassing for everyone involved  
i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this socalled romanticcomedyaction movie  
ugh  
what a pile of dung  
hey  im actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here  but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time  
its sad really  
a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy  including the overused  folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart  gag  
and how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things  
pure hilarity  
or maybe im just too jaded  too much of a critic  not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluffpiece    uuuhhmmm    naaaaah   
this movie sucks the big one  
its chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot  
this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because    well  
its supposed to be funny  see  
you see  that person then has their legs swinging in the other persons face as they drive and that distracts the driver  see  and well  thats kinda funny  no  
harumph    yeah  
well    you 
get the picture  
anyhoo  freddie prinze jr     nuff 
said  
monica potter  a bad career move  but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit  
the rest of the model girls    well  
thanks for being there so i had something to look at  but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole  for making them all out to be complete imbeciles   
so why the three points out of ten  you may ask  
well  its simple really  
one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent  dont ask me why  but it actually turned me on   
one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie  nice window decoration    natch    
and one last point goes out to the makers of this film  who spared us any long sorted story  and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only  minutes of manufactured garbage  so that we could run out as fast as we can  grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is    freddie prinze jr    i 
mean  head over heels  
youve been warned  good people  
ps  didja notice how i didnt even mention rear window once in my entire review  
i didnt want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing  but then again  i just did mention it  but i guess it doesnt count in the ps section    or 
does it  
ooooh  whatever    i have a headache  
  i think my brain is coming back to life  
wheres joblo coming from  
 things i hate about you     coyote ugly      
 down to you      
 save the last dance     shes all that      
 the wedding planner     youve got mail
