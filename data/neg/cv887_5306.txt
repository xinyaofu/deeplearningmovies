this talky  terriblyplotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux  an exnew orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder mystery after a lightplane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat  
he and his wife annie  kelly lynch  rescue a little salvadorian girl  samantha lagpacan  from the wreckage and thats when the trouble begins  
the other major players include a local drug lord  eric roberts   his scheming wife  teri hatcher   a soused stripper  mary stuart masterson   and a shady dea agent  vondie curtis hall   
everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective thats curious but never compelling  
based on the book by james lee burke  heavens prisoners is so badly plotted that entire  scenes  seem to be missing  
early on  we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves  
nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa  
later  dave is reunited with a drugabuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation  
huh  
the whole movie is like this  perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf  
whatever the reason  somebody should tell director phil joanou  final analysis  to recut this mess  
in its present form  heavens prisoners runs only two hours plus change  but it feels like four
