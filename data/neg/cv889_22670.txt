some movies prerelease buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when theyre finally released  everyone just goes along with it  
thus sometimes  films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations  
last year it was the thin red line  
this years  winner  is the hurricane  pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  
acclaimed director norman jewisons biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun  
and thats supposed to be ok because  see  its a true story  
its about rubin  hurricane  carter  denzel washington   a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly  racist   
detective  dan hedaya  whos had it in for the  bigshot  hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife  in selfdefense but who cares  right   
when rubin was only ten  
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole  
most of the film takes place when he is in his th year in prison  
to the rescue  lesra martin  vicellous reon shannon  and his team of wannabe detectives  
lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three welloff canadian white people  hanna  unger  schreiber  to get an education  
lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book   the sixteenth round   rubins autobiography  
immediately thereafter  schreibers character tells lesra  sometimes we dont pick the books we read  they pick us   
hmmm  
after a few visits to the prison  they become convinced of rubins innocence and launch their own fullscale investigation even though two juries have convicted him  
they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses  i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces   and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricanes innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings  
of course  were already told that hes innocent  
a movie like this is especially frustrating because were not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life  
all too obviously  were getting the hollywood watered down version  
that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it  
its almost cruel  
the melodrama isnt of the entertaining kind either  its the hokey  rammeddownyourthroat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity  
witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudosaintliness of our four protagonists  
the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except its a nofrills courtroom movie  
its formula stripped to the bare necessities  
you have your wrongly accused black man  
you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene  
but theres nothing else  
youd expect some sort of involving investigation  
but thats not necessary since were implicitly informed of his innocence  
thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding  
brooding to himself  
brooding to other inmates  
brooding to lesra  
brooding to lesras canadian friends  
brooding in letters  
i dont think ill ever look at brooding the same way again  
it wasnt long before i got tired of hearing the hurricanes exceedingly deep meditations on his condition  
i wanted something to happen  
as for washingtons performance in the title role  i figured id have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention its received  he is top notch  though still boring  
how is that possible  
well  he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly  
unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap  
what a waste of a great performer  
speaking of wastes  why the hell did john hannah agree to do this  
hes an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly  but what is he doing here  
to call his character  along with schreibers and ungers  a stick figure would be a gross understatement  
all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas  as benevolent as dogooders come  
if theyre to play a major part in this movie  why not make them real people  with real feelings and emotions  
look  if youre going to make a formula movie  dont undermine the formula  
courtroom dramas can be fun  but this is ridiculous  
not only is it trite  its boring
