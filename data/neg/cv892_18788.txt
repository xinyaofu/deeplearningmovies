okay  bear with me yall  cause first off i have to get this off my chest  
what the hell is up with that damn crab    
whew  okay  
cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end  as cute as the crab maybe  
even i know that you need more footage than  that   
and that wasnt the only thing getting on my nerves  
the cutesy gimmicks  saccharine sweet score  soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar  as amanda  and sean patrick flannery  as tom  might have held some appeal during  oh  say the first  minutes of the movie  
at first the movie moves along at a quick  interesting pace  
it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street  whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just  doesnt  die  
a ridiculous concept  yes  but at this point im willing to accept it because im willing to accept that this is how amandas life is changed  how her powers are received  
later on  the movie cant seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom  
and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying  they werent just repetitive  they were out of place and unnecessary  
the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed  sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development  amanda suddenly becoming a great chef  her falling in love with tom  etc    sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good  
some places the plot just doesnt make sense  sometimes its way too contrived  the crab bit  for example   and sometimes too corny  peaches emitting dry ice  
cant beat that   
all in all the plot seemed fragmented  unconnected  
not romantic at all  and only funny in some places  
so  okay  do the magic powers come from the crab  
or the fairy godfather  
she can  float  now too  
and all of a sudden  instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches  she can put her emotions into her food  
tom all of a sudden just accepts amandas  witchcraft  in the end  
would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupacs video  
what the hell is up with that damn crab  
it is unfortunate  because i liked the basic premise of the movie  until it became too fantastical and tiresome  
the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least  a  theme for a while  but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and  minutes of people crying at their tables  
the humor was good in some places  nolan gets the funniest bits  including that incomprehensible  totally random thing with the dolls   
gellar and flannery are qualified actors  and gellar has a particular charm  but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy  or even annette in the upcoming  cruel intentions   than this sorry excuse for a character  
its almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is  or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible  
the supporting character nolan was a highlight  though he reminded me a bit of kevin in  youve got mail   see footnotes   
and  as always  typical of a chick flick  romantic comedy  theres a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background  cued up at all the right places  
this sort of got on the nerves after a while  too  
  simply irresistible  is not hard to understand  light  funny in some places  and generally disappointing because it cant draw the line between romance and protracted sap  between humor and tired slapstick  
and how could i refrain from making a pun  
  
  
  
  simply irresistible  is all too easy to resist  
  first viewing    
  did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to  youve got mail   or  the shop around the corner    
business rivals fall in love  
female counterparts business is in danger of being shut down  
female as mother like figure guiding her  
the annoying  hysterical exgirlfriends  
  i really like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe
