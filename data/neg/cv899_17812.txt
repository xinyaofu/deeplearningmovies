in life  eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison  
after about an hour of watching this movie  you begin to realize how their characters feel  
fortunately  for audience members theres a chance to escape the nearest exit  
this  undoubtedly  is eddie murphys worst movie and thats an accomplishment  
remember the golden child  harlem nights  
compared to life  they look like citizen kane  
life is long  predictable  foulmouthed and only intermittently funny  
its minute running time feels like  years  
robert ramsey and matthew stones script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as  motherf    s  or  n      
s   
you lose count how many times both those obnoxious  offensive words are used  
and if that all it takes to write a script  than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie  
but  like life  it will probably stink  
to be honest  the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up  
but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well  
life is as sophisticated as a belch  
its crude and stereotypical  
years ago  movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient  secondclass people  good for being only maids and servants  
for the most part  the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved  
but a new  more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies  
in many recent films  through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers  blacks are presented as fasttalking  conniving  scam artists or hiphop  guncrazy  sexcrazed youths  
both sets of caricatures are demeaning  
and the fault does not rest with the actors  
they have to eat  too  
it is with the people who write the scripts  the studios who greenlight the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest  
lifes only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into  year olds  
otherwise  life is an embarrassment  a blot on the resumes of those associated with it  
see it at your own risk
