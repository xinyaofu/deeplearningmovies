in the year   captain leo davidson  mark wahlberg   boogie nights   is training his chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station  
when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles pod is lost  davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the  planet of the apes   
maybe if th century fox had set the proverbial  chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr    cast away    and lawrence konner  mark d  rosenthal   mighty joe young    
director tim burtons unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly  pointless remake  
davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror  whom he wisely joins  
however  hes rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo  paul giamatti   duets    
ari  helena bonham carter   fight club    daughter of the illustrious senator sandar  david warner   titanic   and simian bleeding heart  believes humans should live with apes on equal standing  an unpopular notion  
she takes a liking to leo  who she deems unusual   
general thade  tim roth   lucky numbers   is of the opposite opinion  wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race  
hes sweet on ari  
its relatively easy to see where this new story is going from the onset  yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes  
the much ballyhooed surprise ending is a nonsensical let down  
an attempt at a love triangle  conveyed by ari and the human daena  estella warren   driven   giving each other back off looks over leo  fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them  
the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado  glenn shadix  and his trophy wife nova  burtons squeeze  lisa marie   
guffaws will also likely greet charlton hestons cameo as thades father  the one ape harboring a firearm    who sputters some very familiar lines before dying  
the only real success of the   planet of the apes  is rick bakers makeup  and even thats an iffy affair  
no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors eyes  a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work  
roth  warner and michael clarke duncan  as thades right hand man attar  are given the most impressive makeovers  
giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal  
tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right  his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about  most spectacularly when mounting his steed  but evens hes undone by some obvious wire work  
bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic  but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing  
most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover  
the apes city resembles a dank complex of tree houses  
the apes military costumes  colleen atwood   sleepy hollow   as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishiokas work on coppolas  dracula   
that oriental flavor is also found in danny elfmans tribal  percussive score  
  planet of the apes  was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of   a dismal movie season thats going to the dogs
