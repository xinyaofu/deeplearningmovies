walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids  
it seems that a woman has also been kidnappedshe is the sister of one of them  e  t  s 
henry thomas  and the girlfriend of another  flannery  and the asking price is  million  which said snots are unable to cough up alone  
they even cut off walkens finger to show they mean business  because they are desperate to save the womans life  
suicide kings is a terrible film  
walken aside  there isnt a single appealing cast member  
ofallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance  
in an amusingly unironic scene  walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a teeits as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director  
the plot is another issue entirely  
ofallon is someone whom im betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times  for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return  do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster  which is entirely unrelated to both the story and learys character  or the numerous anecdotal sequences    but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess  filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses    
by the fourth big revelationtwist  i had completely tuned out  wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material  
recently a peer  a fellow young filmmaker  informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys  the mob  and the fbi  
it occurred to me then whats wrong with indies like suicide kings  i suspect ofallon has never met a mobster  is not a rich man  doesnt deliver endless  clever  monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots    
in short  these guys are just riffing on other movies  and in doing that  making the same film over and over and over again  
tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantinos niche instead of carving their own
