in the mids  following the splendid debut in hugh hudsons greystoke and relative success of first highlander film  it looked like christopher lamberts acting career might go somewhere  
but  it wasnt meant to be  which became obvious following highlander ii  
in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality  
very often such films were science fiction  which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert  
whether it was because of real lack of talent  terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isnt important  the end result was almost always horrible  
the same can be said for fortress   science fiction film directed by stuart gordon  director who created cult following with his s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond  
the movie is set in   
for some undisclosed reason  usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child  
jake  christopher lambert  and karen brennick  lori laughlin  broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border  
sentenced to  years in prison  they are both thrown into fortress  privately owned correctional facility  equiped with stateoftheart futuristic technology and run by computer called zed  
although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible  prison authorities often use violence  
jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape  
such escape should become necessity  because the warden poe  kurtwood smith  begins showing unhealthy interest in karen  
after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison  this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity  
the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich  s and situations that are painfully predictable  
by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress  those situations not only begin to look predictable  but utterly implausible too  
of course  film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultraexpensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society  
the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters  played by not too interested or talented actors  
lori laughlin  although physically attractive  shows the acting ability of sequoia  
kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired  capable of solid  yet forgettable performance  
lamberts performance is also good  but even the bigger talent couldnt help this film  destined to end in oblivion
