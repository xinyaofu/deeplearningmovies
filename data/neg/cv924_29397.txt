a number of critics have decided that its open season on freddie prize jr   slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in soundalike  disposable teen fluff like  head over heels    boys and girls    down to you  and  shes all that   
while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend  his talent is not  
i first saw him in the independent dark comedy  the house of yes   where he gave a subtle  impressive performance as the younger brother in one of americas freakiest families  
prinze has the acting chops  he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grownup movies to show the nonbelievers that he has what it takes  
  summer catch  certainly wont help his case  
inoffensive  but utterly generic  the baseballrelated romantic comedy does little more than kill time  
the story deals with the love affair between tenley  jessica biel   a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan  prinze   a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a bigtime baseball star  
ryans preoccupation with his new honeybunny drives her elitist father  bruce davison  crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team  
its a wonder the kid has any time to pitch  as his time is occupied with making out with tenley  fighting with her dad  bonding with his own dad  fred ward  who deserves better than this   fighting with his brother  jason gedrick  and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates  
the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky  characterheavy baseball movie like  bull durham   but havent got a clue how to get there  
and so they glide from one clich  to the next for  minutes  
the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a centerfielder from texas  
in an early barroom scene  blucas  best known as demonfighting riley finn from  buffy the vampire slayer   hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass  then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states   he does have a nice ass  
a bubble butt   
when lillard gives him an  are you insane   
look  blucas calmly says   its nothing sexual   then goes on to evaluate the hindends of some other players  including lillards  
speaking of asses  prinze does not bare his in the movie  
the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract  so two stuntbutts were employed for a couple of seminude shots  
blucas  whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story  gets another unique moment late in the film  
sick of hearing teammates make  fat chick  jokes  he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amplysized ladies  
while his speech still ends up objectifying women  it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie  
trivial tidbit   summer catch  marks a scooby doo summit  
marc blucas appears in  jay and silent bob strike back  as fred from the scooby doo gang  while freddie prinze jr  plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon
