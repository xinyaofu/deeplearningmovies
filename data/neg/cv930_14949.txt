soldier is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesnt have jean claude van damme in it  
i could liken it to the scifi cheese that was the hollywood productofchoice back in the early s  but that would be too much of a compliment  
if there is a movie theater in hell  this film is playing there  hours a day  
the story  such that there is  revolves around todd  kurt russell   an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a nottoodistant ultraconservative future  is there any other kind   
after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him  todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy  
who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed  but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesnt matter  because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys  
after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash  yes folks  theres more  we see todd as a buff  scarred adult  now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat  
theres a new wrinkle  though  
todd and his brethren are declared obsolete  and a new batch of soldiers takes their place  
after losing a sanctioned battle with dragons jason scott lee  the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying icecube tray  well  thats what is looked like  on a remote garbage planet  
if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet  and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them  youre way ahead of the game  
the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you halfexpect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute  
its surprising that soldier is the brainchild of blade runner cowriter david webb peoples  
unlike that mindtwisting classic  this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three doublespaced pages  
add into the mix the mortal kombats paul anderson inept direction  and its easy to see how soldier turned out so bad  
and the special effects  
remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars  
gary busey is in this movie  
nuff said  
soldier is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults  
that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all  
now if youll excuse me  i have to go weep for the future
