exuniversal soldier luc has to battle a group of newermodel engineered fighters gone bad  
the review 
jeanclaude van damme has a oneliner early on in universal soldier  the return  his latest attempt to remain relevant  that sums up this entire movie  he says  been there  done that   
no film critic could possibly sum up van dammes recent film choices any better  
while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres  schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films   van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him  martial arts and guns  
this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world  with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex  
he joins fellow martial artistaction star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away  
universal soldier  the return is truly poor  
the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade  specifically terminator   judgement day and the similarly named soldier  
soldiers kurt russell was an older model supersoldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors  for the good of a planet  schwarzeneggers terminator in t tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine  the t  and jeanclaude  a former universal soldier  has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of  you guessed it  newer model soldiers  
considering the poor box office performance of soldier  its amazing that this project was ever given the goahead  
luc devereaux  van damme  was the sole remaining universal soldier  or unisol for short   until he was returned to a normal  if muscular  human form  
in this sequel  technically the fourth film in the series  following two straighttovideo duds that were ignored here plotwise   luc is now a human trainerconsultant of sorts for the unisol program  
working with dylan cotner  xander berkeley  who interestingly also appeared in t   the unisol program has engineered a tougher  fiercer fighting force with the help of supercomputer seth  
unfortunately  upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government  seth takes control of his soldiers  killing everyone in the building except for luc  his partner maggie  his daughter hillary and erin  a reporter trapped inside  
the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive  while beating up a group of nearindestructible soldiers  most notably romeo  popular wrestler goldberg   
there are lots of fights  gun battles  lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  
there are so many clich  s in this film that it is almost painful to watch  
luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on  and in the course of a single night  they go from bickering to falling for each other  to kissing  
erin is a patheticallywritten character  people are getting brutally gunned down all around her  and yet  not only does this not seem to frighten her  but she finds time to remind luc that she  isnt leaving without her story   
whatever  
other laughable moments include a  luc going to a strip club to get internet access  what   and b  a group of rangers  who after having been given good advice  luc tells them that their weapons are useless  and shows them a specific gun which should work better   choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway  guess who wins the battle    
not one single scene in universal soldier  the return has any originality to it  
when fuelled by don davis loud  driving music score  the films many fights become almost passable  but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves  
director mic rodgers  a former stunt coordinator  keeps the action coming at a rapid pace  with only a few token serious moments to be found  
his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows  tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion  
if only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li  rodgers could probably have made a decent action film  
to place the blame squarely at van dammes feet  however  is an injustice  
im not sure that anyone  not even robert deniro or edward norton  could make writers william malone and john fasanos script sound good  
one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access  
he cringes  looks down and mutters  uh    uhm    
they all do  i saw it on  minutes  
eh he he he  the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg  
he chews up every scene he is in  obviously enjoying his role immensely  
he even gives the film a few laughs  as he mutters things like  i really dont like that guy  every time he fails to kill luc  
sadly  his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier  the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo
