the plot of big mommas house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress  
thats not just the highconcept premise  its the fullyrealized  allencompassing plot  
such an emphasis is not unheardof in the world of hollywood summer entertainment  
one need merely look back to last summer  when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent  
the trap inherent in such an approach is that the highconcept plot idea better be pretty wellrealized  or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer  because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time  not a developed character  not a provocative theme  not a witty twist  
you will get plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress  nothing more  nothing less  
those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the onenote dud that is big mommas house  
others will simply stare  mouth agape  at its sheer unapologetic laziness  
lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner  an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john  paul giamatti   
dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco  terrence howard  has escaped from prison  and the feds think hes headed for his former girlfriend and presumedbutneverproved accomplice sherry  nia long   
sherry  however  has fled with her son trent  jascha washington   possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae  ella mitchell   better known as big momma  
indeed  sherry appears to be on her way  but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming  
that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows  
big mommas houses bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs  
doubtfire  director raja gosnell edited that film  and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom  but theres just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main characters attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman  
unfortunately  big mommas house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made  instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses  it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters  
suspension of disbelief in big mommas house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind andor stupid  since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other  
of course  laughs trumps logic every time  and big mommas house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny  
and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foultempered beast  while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry  
unfortunately  no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another  very different real person  so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags  malcolm reacting violently to big mommas explosive diarrhea attack  malcolmasmomma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball  malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments  malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife  one of the few sequences that works   
martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times  but theres no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character  
hes just big momma without the makeup on  
i wont waste time commenting on how ineptly the setup of the escaped convict is employed  since it was clearly a waste of time to the filmmakers  
there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure  but hes ultimately a distraction in a film thats really about its central visual incongruity  and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia longs posterior   
im never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people  several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing  but i know that when a filmmaker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that its an entire film  i duck out of the way  
the gross implausibility of big mommas house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big  cleverlyconstructed laughs  
its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant  
big mommas house is ridiculous and not funny  
its just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress
