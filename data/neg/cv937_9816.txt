take a look at the following equation     
a christmas carolghostbustersscrooged 
yes  scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment  comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether  
scrooged is alternatively sick  gross  funny  and then sickly soppy  
bill murray plays frank cross  a t  v executive with a horrible personality  
hes evil to secretary  actors  crew  everyone  except the t  vs stations boss  of course  played by the late robert mitchum  however  he is then visited by a very dead exec  who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts  past  present and future  who is called the ghost of yet to come  for some reason  sure enough  they arrive  show cross how much of a s  o  b he is  and he changes his way  
however  throughout this simple plot  weve got to suffer outlandish special effects  poor comedy  and an very  very mean performance from bill murray  
frank cross isnt funny mean  hes just mean  
he also isnt very good at emotional scenes  and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film  with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is  and how he has changed  
however  the supporting cast are ok  with good performances from mitchum  allen  who plays his girlfriend  and john glover  who plays crosss partner  the ghost of christmas past isnt that bad either  
sadly  though  the audience has to suffer  minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present  played by carol kane  
whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny  should be fired straight away  
and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait  the guy with the annoying voice in police academy   if i remeber correctly      
who  thankfully  dosent say much  
the script is horrendous  
michael odonaghue churns out terrible  bad taste jokes  which i guess is the whole point really  then changes direction completely to emotional scenes  
and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes  which are awful  
the special effects look nice  but do nothing for the film  
theres some impressive make up effects also  
the music is also good  which is scored by danny elfman  
but great effects and make up dont make a great film  
scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience  seeing as the first  hour  minutes of the film are so depressing anyway  and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech  
why didnt cross just look out his exec window  and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him  
overall  then  youd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided  perhaps a plague
