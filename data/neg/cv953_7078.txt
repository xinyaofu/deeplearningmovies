capsule  combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark  a dash of a jackie chan movie  sans jackie   two teaspoons of gun and swordplay  and a dollop of cgi  
simmer for  minutes  
yields  zilch  
the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier  better movies that after the fifteenminute mark i started cataloguing them out loud  
its hard to make a good actionadventure movie that doesnt simply recycle its predecessors  and ive seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully  
the phantom  allegedly based on the longrunning comic of the same name  doesnt even bother to be graceful  
its a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list  but ill try  
the film opens up with a  prelude  sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voiceover to compensate for whatever got thrown out  
we go from there to a jungle sequence that  i swear to god  recycles the truckchase scene from raiders of the lost ark notefornote  possibly even shotforshot  right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush  and then goes on to rip off the ropebridge scene from  sorcerer  as well  
sorcerer  as you may well remember  was a remake of a french movie  the wages of fear  in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain  
both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick  but ive got my job to do  so back to the salt mines we go  
anyway  the cinematic theft doesnt stop there  
or at least the lack of inspiration  
there isnt a single thing here we havent seen  and its not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest  
we have  wheres my list   
a bad girl  a tough good girl  a secret cave hideaway  which seems inspired more by dr  
no than anything else   a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality  magical artifacts of terrible power  and caryhiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself  
what else is there  
the plot is a waste of time  
the sets alternate between big but hokey  and tiny and still hokey  
there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mstked  and im sure once mike and the bots get the cash  theyll stick it on their sked  
the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane  hes a good actor  and he tries very hard  even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another  
all i can say is that i pray this isnt the beginning of the end for him  although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comicbook superhero movie
