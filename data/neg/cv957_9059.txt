recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldnt sleep  
he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour  
then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food  
then he took down a volume of shakespeares work and read it cover to cover  never really paying attention to the words or plot  
and then  as a climax  he took out his video camera and pressed the  on  button  
the result  
william shakespeares romeo  juliet  the worst film ever made and a complete failure  
though  to be fair  an interesting complete failure  
the idea at the films core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds  
this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we cant see what is going on  
and filming the dialogue in voice over  
and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model  
and making the frame go still while flashing the characters name at the bottom  
and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion  
i mean  man  this is the s  dude  
however ive seen terrible films that are fun to watch  
  examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau  
  that rule doesnt apply here  
this is a film that takes itself seriously  
that is its major fault  
another problem was pointed out by my friend  alex  who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout  
   the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didnt take sides  
here its clear that we are supposed to side with romeo  
  just look at the way they film him  
  from the begining hes our hero and this doesnt work  
and dicaprios awful performance doesnt help  
luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us  
the result is a mess  
you can feel him striving to be something he isnt  
he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles  
he tries very hard  
key word  tries  
  oh look  hes filming above water action from below  
pretty  
what does it represent   
why do people do ugly things  
i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face
