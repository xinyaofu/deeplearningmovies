while watching loser  it occurred to me that amy heckerlings true genius as a filmmaker is casting  
in fast times at ridgemont high  she gave us sean penns jeff spicoli  in look whos talking  she turned bruce willis into a wisecracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival  in clueless  she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is  or was  alicia silverstone  
she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws  
unfortunately  she may also be starting to understand that she understands  
giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies  
giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal is the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser  
naturally  heckerling makes her protagonist an allaround swell guy  
paul tannek  jason biggs  is a smalltown boy who gets a scholarship to nyu  then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the coldhearted big city  
paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman  his roommates adam  zak orth   chris  tom sadoski  and noah  jimmi simpson  are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul  
paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar  in this case the lovely dora diamond  mena suvari   
dora has problems of her own  including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor  edward alcott  greg kinnear   thats more than slightly onesided  
theyre two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people  so clearly they belong together  even if paul is a loser  
i must confess that  for a while  i was suckered in by heckerlings casting  
jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace  suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence  
theyre pleasant enough to watch  and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists arent  
then it gradually becomes clear that theres virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort  
in theory  loser is a romantic comedy  but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film  notable exception  a cameo by a scenestealing comic actor as a video store clerk   
instead of taking any time to make the characters situations funny  heckerling spends  minutes making her characters situations pathetic  
she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless  nor any of that films interest in lively plotting  not surprisingly  since cluelesss plot came via jane austens emma   
she simply turns the film into a pity party  
since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character  you might think that those characters would be interesting  or at least slightly complicated  
instead  you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that theres no reason to watch them  
paul isnt just a nice guy  hes flawless  consequently  hes a central character who does absolutely no growing  
his roommates arent just inconsiderate  theyre actively evilblackmailing professor alcott  drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name  
and professor alcott isnt just manipulative  he turns dora into his house slave  
doras unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser  and even that isnt explored in sufficient detail  
theres more ambiguity in the second snippet from alan cummings broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser its one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations  its another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush  
and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow    
i dont know    
comic  
still  i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora  
that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkels  scarborough faircanticle   
instead of giving the sequence a knowing winka reference to the graduate  a hint that paul is becoming an overlysensitive clichheckerling plays it deadly straight  
even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonists foibles  she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint  
cluelesss cher had her selfabsorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness  
in loser  amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness  her one show of wit involves naming pauls dorm  hunts hall  after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall   
her gift with casting proved to be her curse  
loser may be a crashing bore  but gee  arent those two kids swell
