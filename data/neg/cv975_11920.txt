in the  updating of mickey spillanes  novel  i  the jury   hardboiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am  dresses like don johnson in  miami vice  with less pastels  and has sworn off alcohol  
however  he still smokes his lucky strikes  detests all forms of authority  and kills at a whim  
beyond that  the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy pageturner by spillane  probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers  
the movie starts off with a bang  a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series  complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti   rocky    
after that  the movie and the book begin the same  with the murder of jack williams  frederick downs   a onearmed detective and hammers best friend  
hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jacks death  and with the help of his devoted secretary  the blond and shapely velda  laurene landon   and the alternately friendly  antagonistic police chief pat chambers  paul sorvino   he is immediately on the killers trail  
here the movie splits completely from the book  and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia  the cia  one of hammers vietnam vet buddies  and a kinky sex clinic  
many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie  but they take on slightly different roles  
for instance  charles kalecki  alan king   a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book  turns into a suave mob boss  
and  more importantly  hammers suspicious love interest  charlotte bennett  barbara carrera   morphs from a runofthemill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic  
  i  the jury  is one of several cinematic renditions of spillanes books  including a  version which was made in d   but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way  it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywoods production code  
although this takes the  version of  i  the jury  closer to the core of the original subject matter  it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism  because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book  
rest assured  the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity  but it is thoroughly violent  especially toward women  
it features one woman having her neck slashed  a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia  judson scott   and another woman shot pointblank in the belly by hammer himself  
no one would deny that spillanes writing has a definite misogynistic nature  but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment  its constant equation of sex and violence  much of which is played with the intention of being erotic  is quite unsettling  
its no surprise that the movie  like the book  fades to black with a dead woman on the floor  
  i  the jury  had a troubled production and was not wellsupported by the studio that made it  which is one explanation why it didnt do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made  
the script was written by larry cohen  who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies  like  its alive     and its two sequels   q      and  the stuff      
cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well  but he was yanked from the directors chair after only a weeks worth of shooting because he was already    over budget  
he was quickly replaced by richard t  heffron  who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects  
heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent  but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently  
it shows in the final product  
cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer  but heffron has none  
he shot the movie quickly and clumsily  and although some scenes ring true  most of them are flat  trite  and invariably dull  
the movie features numerous car chases  shootouts  and stunts  but heffrons background in television is the dominant tone  despite the graphic violence and fullfrontal nudity   i  the jury   takes on the air of a madefortv quickie  with no real punch or depth  
but the problems in  i  the jury  run deeper than the technical  
the central fault in this updating is mike hammer  whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties  
because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person  hammers character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona  
we never really get that impression in the movie  there is no firstperson voiceover narration and some scenes dont have hammer in them at all  
consequently  a great deal of the texture of spillanes storytelling is lost  
the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammers moral code is thrown to the wind  
despite his characterization as a hardnosed  violent  misogynistic killer  hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code  
the title itself   i  the jury   refers to his antiestablishment notion of being his own law  
unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police  hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment  
in this way  he can be seen as  above the law   but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct  his own morality  
the movie forgoes that aspect of his character  and hammer comes off not only as amoral in societys terms  but in any terms  especially his own  
if anything  hammer always had his professionalism  but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful  
maybe the scene was intended for laughs  but it only cheapens hammers character and is  by all accounts  a lousy way to start the movie  
the blame for hammers character cant be laid on assantes shoulders  because despite some unnecessary marlon brandonlike mumbling  he delivers a fine performance  
spillane never once described hammers physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared  so any actor could conceivably portray him  
of course  because of the lack of written description  those who have read spillanes books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like  and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations  spillane  who played the character himself in s  the girl hunters   is generally considered the best of the film hammers   
the rest of actors are most unnoteworthy  
with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino  everyone who appeared in  i  the jury  were upandcomers who basically went nowhere  
many of them ended up working in television  like carrera  who had a short stint on  dallas  in the mideighties   which only adds to the madefortv atmosphere of the film  
maybe someday  someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book  but this is certainly not it
