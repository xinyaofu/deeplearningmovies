while i am not fond of any writers use of cheap  easy puns  i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it  witness my review of pecker from a couple of issues ago   
so here goes  the juvenile  collegeset black comedy deadmanoncampus is dead on arrival  
straitlaced med student josh  tom everett scott  who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout  s blemishfree academic record breaks out into fs  thanks to the influence of his everpartying roommate  cooper  markpaul gosselaar   who introduces josh to the sex and boozefilled nights that come with university life  
with the threat of losing an academic scholarship  josh  and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming  cooper   what are two goodhearted slackers to do  
easylook for a loophole  which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a students  or students  roommate commits suicide  the surviving student  s  shall receive straight as  
so instead of studying  josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there  move him into their dorm room  and drive him to suicide before the semester ends  
director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white  working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder  take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and coopers diabolical plot  
until then  the usual boring cliches of college life  booze  sex  more booze  fill the time  which is made to feel longer by savedbythebell alumnus gosselaars sitcombred mugging  
that said  once cohn and company do build some comic momentum  they mishandle it  
the introduction of the manic  psychotic cliff  lochlyn munro   a potential roommate for josh and cooper  brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates  paranoid nerd buckley  randy pearlstein  and british death rocker matt  corey page   
one wishes that cliff would reappear  but  as they say  be careful what you wish for  
not surprisingly  he does resurface  and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose  almost immediately  his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty  
the same can be said about all of deadmanoncampus  
whatever morbid appeal the farfetched premise has quickly evaporates  and the selfabsorbed characters  especially cooper  pretty much grate from the getgo  
deadman doesnt grow tiresome  it already is once the clever opening titles are through  
as it slogs along to a cheesy  happyforallparties conclusion  deadman lives up to its title and then somenot only does the movie grow even more tired and die  it still insists on going on    
like a zombie
