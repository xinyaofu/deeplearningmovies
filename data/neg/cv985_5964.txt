boy  what a great movie   
keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together  the director of the fugitive  andrew davis  back again to give us another thriller  and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot  
how could this not be a blockbuster  
all diehard keanu reeves fans  read on  
ol  much ado about nothing  plays eddie kasalivich  a machinist studying at the university of chicago  
to help pay for the rent  he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university  
by happy coincidence  he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics  
this project holds great promise  taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in  
a potential solution to the earths energy problems without the pollution cost  
surely nobody could have any problems with that  
morgan freeman is paul shannon  the projects sponsor  
he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public  
he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly  
so he murders the project leader  blows up the project  great but short scene here  sort of like a mini id citydevastation thing  and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hitech hushhush location  
unfortunately  our intrepid machinist and an english physicist  weisz  manage to get away and now follows a fugitivelike chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script  
this movie is just dying for a comparison with  the fugitive   
both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesnt change much  i guess we cant really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere  
the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones  chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward  
credit to them  but we arent really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters  
where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy  eddie kasalivich just doesnt seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop  
it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences  which frankly  get quite boring after a while  
harrison ford was  the man against the world   
he was alone in a world where he didnt know who to trust and it came across real well  
in chain reaction  keanu reeves isnt alone  
now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia  vulnerability and confusion  
we dont get this  
we get him thinking hes still in speed  only now our sandra bullock has an english accent  probably doesnt drive a bus  and hardly contributes anything to the movie  
the producers here probably thought   hey  what if keanu and rachel dont hit it off too well  
lets rope in that morgan to help us out   
well  keanu and rachel didnt hit it off well on the screen  and most unfortunately  morgan freeman doesnt help much either  
the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder  
its not really his fault  
once again  andrew davis just doesnt take the time to build his characters  
someone must have convinced him that this time round  cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv broadcast  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
