please dont mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam    i 
just want to warn all of yall not to waste your hardearned  on anaconda  
its not even worth a cent video rental  
dont listen to ebert on this one  he has no clue what hes talking about   
btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was  required  to watch it on assignment  she reviews movies for a local paper   
now ill actually back up my huffing and puffing  
here goes  
movie  anaconda rydains bottom line  wait for it to come on usa up all night  
even then  i doubt its worth the price of jolt  to help you stay up that late   
why do i hate anaconda  
let me count the ways    
first of all  this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong  
as an ophiophile  snake lover   i can tell you that a  anacondas would never reach a length of  feet  b  theyre scared of people  c  cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snakes mouth  and constrictor snakes dont kill what they cant eat  d  people can outrun snakes with no trouble  especially heavy ones like anacondas  e  if an anaconda did eat a human  it would need at least  months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal  therefore it couldnt run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast  and f  snakes have no vocal cords  so they cant make funny squealing noises  
whew  
i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it  
unfortunately  anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel  
my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end  
anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually  
that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didnt give up and fall asleep  
he was the most likable character in the movie  
who wouldnt enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman  
anaconda did have its cute moments  arguments between ice cubes character and the british guy  for instance  
however  those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twentyeight minutes of boring schlock  
the writers had  and blew  a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines  
i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny  
did she retort with a clever  egowithering comeback  
of course not  
  im trying to work   
gee  thats even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with  
she could have told him to go find a knothole or something    
  p but i will admit  there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome  hint  it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks   
as for the plot  im still trying to find one  
this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous  computergenerated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the fasterthangravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet  
  harrier snake   
not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims  
the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist  should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense   in which the sick guys gfriend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him  
that was about as clear and understandable as mission  impossible  
  if someone could explain that movie to me  id be most grateful  
all the oldguy double agents looked the same    
i wasnt inspired by the acting  save for the evil dude  
i cant blame the actors  though  
its not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with  
this concludes rydains diatribe on a shameless exploitation  and perpetuation   of public fear of snakes  
comments  flames  anyone  
rydain the atomic cheese  fresh from chernobyl dairies
