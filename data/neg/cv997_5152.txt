the kids in the hall are an acquired taste  
it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer  
maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies  they would grow into the big screen  
my recommendation is that  unless you are a big fan of the kids  skip the film  
as it is  their firstand most likely onlyattempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv  
a bigbudget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show  
the kids go through the motions  but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so  
and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics  
brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression  
in typical sketchcomedy tradition  each actor plays several roles  
doctor cooper  kevin mcdonald  and his team create the drug  
then  under pressure from don roritor  mark mckinney   founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals  dr  cooper releases the drug into the marketplace  
the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film  
at about  minutes  brain candy still seems long  
the best thing about sketch comedyand the kids are no exceptionis the ability to quickly deliver the laughs  then go on to another quick skit  
but with the additional setup necessary in telling a longer  coherent story  the laughs just dont come fast enough  
strangely  the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv  
the movie makes several attempts at risquenessmostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons charactersbut they seem almost forced  as if they have to live up to a pg rating  
one of the best bits  though  does make use of thompsons naked buttocks  we see him charging into battlegoing to have sex with some guys taking a shower  
in the classic of this genre  monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail  
the kids  unfortunately  are not up to the task  
there are some amusing moments  to be sure  but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one
