films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success  whether theyre about superheroes  batman  superman  spawn   or geared toward kids  casper  or the arthouse crowd  ghost world   but theres never really been a comic book like from hell before  
for starters  it was created by alan moore  and eddie campbell   who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid s with a part series called the watchmen  
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd  
the book  or  graphic novel   if you will  is over  pages long and includes nearly  more that consist of nothing but footnotes  
in other words  dont dismiss this film because of its source  
if you can get past the whole comic book thing  you might find another stumbling block in from hells directors  albert and allen hughes  
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in  well  anything  but riddle me this  who better to direct a film thats set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society  
the ghetto in question is  of course  whitechapel in  londons east end  
its a filthy  sooty place where the whores  called  unfortunates   are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision  
when the first stiff turns up  copper peter godley  robbie coltrane  the world is not enough  calls in inspector frederick abberline  johnny depp  blow  to crack the case  
abberline  a widower  has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium  
upon arriving in whitechapel  he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly  heather graham  say it isnt so  and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon cant stomach  
i dont think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper  so i wont go into the particulars here  other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay  
in the comic  they dont bother cloaking the identity of the ripper  but screenwriters terry hayes  vertical limit  and rafael yglesias  les mis  rables  do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end  
its funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because  after all  an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts  
and from hells ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days   who holds back the electric carwho made steve guttenberg a star     
dont worry  itll all make sense when you see it  
now onto from hells appearance  its certainly dark and bleak enough  and its surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did  at times  it seems like sleepy hollow    
the print i saw wasnt completely finished  both color and music had not been finalized  so no comments about marilyn manson   but cinematographer peter deming  dont say a word  ably captures the dreariness of victorianera london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks  even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the blackandwhite comic  
oscar winner martin childs  shakespeare in love  production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place  
even the acting in from hell is solid  with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent  
ians holm  joe goulds secret  and richardson   dalmatians  log in great supporting roles  but the big surprise here is graham  
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth  imagining her attempt at an irish accent  but it actually wasnt half bad  
the film  however  is all good
