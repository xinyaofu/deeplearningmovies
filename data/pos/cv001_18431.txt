every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio  with every indication that it will be a stinker  and to everybodys surprise  perhaps even the studio  the film becomes a critical darling  
mtv films election  a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon  is a current example  
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened  
the plot is deceptively simple  
george washington carver high school is having student elections  
tracy flick  reese witherspoon  is an overachiever with her hand raised at nearly every question  way  way  high  
mr   m   matthew broderick   sick of the megalomaniac student  encourages paul  a popularbutslow jock to run  
and pauls nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well  for personal reasons  
the dark side of such sleeper success is that  because expectations were so low going in  the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be  
you cant help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews  which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have  
election  a good film  does not live up to its hype  
what makes election so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from rushmore  released a few months earlier  
the similarities are staggering  
tracy flick  election  is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs  and is involved with the school play  
max fischer  rushmore  is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs  and is involved with the school play  
the most significant tension of election is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
the most significant tension of rushmore is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
tracy flick is from a single parent home  which has contributed to her drive  
max fischer is from a single parent home  which has contributed to his drive  
the male bumbling adult in election  matthew broderick  pursues an extramarital affair  gets caught  and his whole life is ruined  
he even gets a bee sting  
the male bumbling adult in rushmore  bill murray  pursues an extramarital affair  gets caught  and his whole life is ruined  
he gets several bee stings  
and so on  
what happened  
how is it that an individual screenplay  rushmore  and a novel  election  contain so many significant plot points  and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other  made from two different studios  from a genre  the high school geeks revenge movie  that hadnt been fully formed yet  
even so  the strengths of election rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick  witherspoon  and newcomer jessica campbell  as pauls antisocial sister  tammy  
broderick here is playing the mr  rooney role from ferris bueller  and he seems to be having the most fun hes had since then  
witherspoon is a revelation  
its early in the year  its a comedy  and teenagers have little clout  but for my money  witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination  
and once campbells character gets going  like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium  then youre won over  
one thing thats been bothering me since ive seen it  
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film  
i suppose that  coming from mtv films  i should expect no less    
but the film starts off light and airy  like a sitcom  
as the screws tighten  and the tensions mount  alexander payne decides to add elements that  frankly  distract from the story  
it is bad enough that mr  m doesnt like tracys determination to win at all costs  but did they have to throw in the studentteacher relationship  
even so  theres no logical reason why mr  m has an affair when he does  
theres a lot to like in election  but the plot similarities to rushmore  and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sexdriven  mark this as a disappointment
