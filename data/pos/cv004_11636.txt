moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the postsalary cap era  youve got to know how to allocate your resources  
every dollar spent on a freeagent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers  
in the nfl  this leads to teams like the detroit lions  who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract  but can only field five guys named herb to block for him  
in the movies  you end up with films like  spawn   with a huge specialeffects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors  
jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking  
he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line  
watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid  fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars  is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit  except that sanders doesnt have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages  
but like the lions star  jackie doesnt have anybody to block for him  
almost every cent thats invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts  and as chan does his own stunts  the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills  
this leaves about  cents to pay for things like directors  chan directs   scripts and dubbing and supporting characters  not to mention the hideous title sequence  
this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain  
  chans first release in this country   rumble in the bronx   was supposedly set in new york  but was filmed in vancouver  and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible   
heck  jackie doesnt even have enough money for a haircut  looks like  much less a personal hairstylist  
in condor  chan plays the same character hes always played  himself  a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen  a master of both kungfu and slapstickfu  
jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert  and is chased by a horde of neonazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs  one of the things i like about jackie chan movies  no political correctness   
he is joined by three women  who have little to do except scream   jackie  save us    and misuse firearms  
the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere  and hes more pathetic than evil  
en route  we have an extended motorcycle chase scene  a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel  with the neonazis  and two confrontations with savage natives  
once at the secret desert base  there is a long chopsocky sequence  followed by the films centerpiece  a windtunnel fight thats even better than the one in faceoff  
this is where the money was spent  on wellchoreographed kungfu sequences  on giant kevlar hamster balls  on smashedup crates of bananas  and on scorpions  
ignore the gaping holes in the plot  how  exactly  if the villains legs were broken  did he escape from the secret nazi base  and why didnt he take the key with him    
dont worry about the production values  or what  exactly  the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara  
just go see the movie  
operation condor has pretentions of being a  raiders of the lost ark  knockoff  but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him  with a lawrence kazdan screenplay  a john williams score  spielberg directing and george lucas producing  condor might be an a movie  
however  youve got to go with what youve got  and what youve got in jackie chan is something special  a talent that mainstream hollywood should  could  and ought to utilize
