apparently  director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film  american history x  i dont know the details of the fight  but it seems that he is not happy with the final product  and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether  
ive heard about this kind of thing happening before  and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce  
as it is  i found american history x to be an extremely good film  not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism  but because of a powerful  charismatic performance from edward norton  
its hard to believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear  but  here he is now  starring in his own film and making himself a star  
norton is one of those performers who becomes his character  and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year  
he plays a young man named derek vinyard  a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother  danny  edward furlong   mother  beverly dangelo   and sister  davin  jennifer lien   
the film opens with a flashback  in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car  
we find out that this lands him in prison  and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny  
in the presenttime of the film  danny is in high school  and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother  
much of the film is told in flashback  and we see the path that leads to dereks adoption of white supremacy  
when derek is released  having served three years in prison  he finds that his brother is now a fullblown skinhead  derek  however  has given up the violence  and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things  
what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid  thoughtless people  they are intelligent and articulate  and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms  
its hard to make a controversial movie and not preach  but kaye has found the right note for his material  
because american history x is a mainstream film  there has to be a redemption phase for our main character  some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic  
i partially disagree with this  because  although i do not advocate racism in any way  its interesting the way kaye presents derek  he is a loud  obnoxious man  but hes also very smart  
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable  his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men  
its clear that hes passionate about his beliefs  and that hes not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up  
of course  it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part  
its astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest  
in addition to getting the look just right  hes perfect for this role  derek requires intelligence  depth  and a whole lot of shouting  and norton does it all with ease  
even when hes at his meanest  derek has a likable quality to him  and thats a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead  
what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of dannys school  avery brooks  becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny  
the other performances are all terrific  with standouts from furlong  dangelo  and lien  
visually  the film is very powerful  
kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices  and most of them work nicely  lots of slowmotion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere  
but  like a lot of movies lately  american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes  
although the climactic scene is very moving  the picture ends with a pretentious  preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed  
for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point  it felt like a slap in the face to be handfed a theme in such a simplistic way  
it makes me wonder what  exactly  tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film  
perhaps this last scene was the problem  
its hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good  in a time when so many movies are timid and weak  american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way
