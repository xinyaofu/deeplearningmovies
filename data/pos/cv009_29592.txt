the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wirefu copycats  
its not a pretty death  and its leaving the likes of schwartznager  stallone  and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea  
sometimes  the mix results in a mindblowing spectacle unlike any other  
quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work  as in s the matrix  can be a real gem  
but too often hollywood gets it wrong  even when they pay off chinese directors  
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists  
mostly its laughable  
in hollywoods rush to emulate the success of the matrix  trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form  
but iron monkey  the latest asian import  shows us how to get it right  
iron monkey  actually a reissue of a  film  is the story of a th chinese vigilante  rongguang yu   fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry  
but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong feihong  most recently seen in one of the most overlooked  and possibly best films of   drunken master   released in the u  s  as the legend of drunken master   
unlike drunken master   which stars jackie chan as an adult feihong  iron monkey finds a much younger feihong  szeman tsang  and his father wong keiying  yen chi dan  thrust into the middle of iron monkeys fight against oppression  
iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master   at times  fighting styles  especially that of monkey himself  do devolve into the ridiculous twinkletoed floating of films like crouching tiger  hidden dragon  director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth  
iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore  kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger  
however  there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters  such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his goodhearted but misguided enemy  chief fox  
in those moments  and in others  iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience  
while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master   iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune  
aka siunin wong feihung tsi titmalau
