plot  a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon  to whom hes devoted a tribute band in which he sings  gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place  
critique  im a sucker for movies like this  
a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams  works hard  devotes the time  the energy and the patience  and ultimately hits it bigtime  
in the case of this film  our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it  yup  luck always finds its way into these types of equations  although generally tied very closely to hard work   they need a new singer  
his entry and adaptation to the whole  rock n roll  lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch  
although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love  or past love  of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it  
metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isnt that prominent anymore  i still check out my motley crue  twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again  
thats not to say that you wont like this film if you dont like the music  but the music and live performances from the band  play a big part in the movie  and i for one  had a blast watching and listening to it all  
but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg  
wow  hand this fella some major props  as he totally becomes this heavy metal geekgod  incidentally  metal god was the films original title  and a much better one if you ask me   
he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through  
he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic  who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams  
aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend  and the romance angle between them was sweet   but she didnt pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes  
i was also impressed by some of the  real  musicians who played in the film  zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne  jeff pilson from dokken  stephan jenkins from third eye blind  blas elias from slaughter   but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members  
its to note that this film was based on a reallife tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer  their original singer also admitted to being gay  as in this film   
just for the record  im certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements  since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies  but because its a fun  uplifting  wellpaced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances  
oh yeah  and for those who dig the  heavier  side of music  the soundtrack also rocks   
you see    dreams 
can come true
