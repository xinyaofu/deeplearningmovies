theres something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days  
stiller currently has three projects in circulation  and what other actor can lay claim to that  
hes in  theres something about mary   which i  still  havent seen  
and hes in the acerbic  your friends  neighbors   playing a talkative  sexuallyfrustrated drama coach called jerri  
now theres  permanent midnight   in which stiller plays another jerry  this one a heroinaddicted television writer  last name stahl  
theres also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drugaddiction pictures the minute theyve proved themselves commercially  
ewan mcgregor springs to mind who  after successful turns in  emma  and  brassed off   received greater respect and admiration for his mindblowing realization as renton in danny boyles transatlantic junkfest   trainspotting   
the philosophy appears to be a simple one  if you want em to be taken seriously  make em do drugs  
  permanent midnight  is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl  a successful hollywood writer who  in the mideighties  had a   aweek job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a   aweek heroin habit  
a habit  in stahls own words   the size of utah   
as stahl  stiller contributes a commanding performance  
unlike  trainspotting   which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse   permanent midnight  instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance  
one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to  naked lunch  author william s  burroughs who  when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds   so i can shave   
stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in  permanent midnight   its so he can talk to his mother on the phone  show up for work on time  even pay his bills  
while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl  the writing  adapted from stahls autobiography by director david veloz  is controlled and pointed  
  permanent midnight  shows how stahl moved from new york to l  a  toagain in the authors words  escape the drug scene   yeah  right   why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec  elizabeth hurley  so impossibly polite youd swear her single profanity was dubbed   and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings  
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty  norristowns own maria bello  with whom he spent some rehab time  
janeane garofalo is wastedand miscastas a heavilybespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the dopedup wordsmith  and thats stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor  
stiller  unshaven  burroughs take note  and with lots of mascara around the eyes  has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but  to his credit  never once pushes his pillpopping  needlejabbing performance over the top  
the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see  permanent midnight   a dark  comic  and strangely absorbing study of assisted living
