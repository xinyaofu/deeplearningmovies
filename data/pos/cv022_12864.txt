a fully loaded entertainment review  website coming in july  
from ace ventura to truman burbank  jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic  yet sympathetic  characters  
s the cable guy was supposed to be his big  breakthrough  role from zany humor into darker  more dramatic acting  
as most everyone knows  the results were  well  lessthanstellar  
not only did the film not do so hot at the box office  but it was also panned by critics  
as far as i know  gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it  
the first time i saw the cable guy  in theatres  i was in super criticmode  and didnt really like it  
however  due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day  ive had time to lean back  relax  and take in the film  
and to my surprise  it grew on me  
the plot is rather simple  broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy  played by carrey  then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship  
see  stevens been having some problems with his girlfriend  robin  leslie mann   and he doesnt think he has any more room in his life for a new friend  
also  some of the cable guys antics have been creeping him out  
carrey  as the cable guy  gives steven various aliases  which later we find out are all tv characters  larry tate  chip douglas  ricky ricardo  etc  he apparently lives in his cable van  and while many critics didnt enjoy this newer  darker  lessmanic performance from carrey  i thought it was interesting and rather welldone  
for me  its not the movie as a whole thats enjoyable  but rather several individual scenes  a karaoke jam at stevens apartment  a medieval fight at a theme restaurant  and a bathroom beating  a la liar  liar   just to name a few  
perhaps the fact that more of carreys humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny  
and if you really want to see something  youve got to hear his version of jefferson airplanes  somebody to love   sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam  
the cable guy has its bad spots  like most any movie  
i didnt particularly like stevens girlfriend  and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend  
also  the ending  while having you fooled for a moment  is rather contrived  and somewhat dissapointing  
still  i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture  if youre at the video store and cant think of anything to rent  i suggest you try it out  
or if you have hbo  just wait till it comes on  you wont have to wait long   
hell  thats what i do every day
