when bulworth ended  i allowed myself a sigh of relief   it is possible for me to enjoy political satire   
there have been several recent political films that didnt do a whole lot for me  wag the dog  for instance  i found to be an intelligent but heartless film  while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness   
bulworth is a far better film than these  both in its execution and lasting impression   
its a tremendously funny and intelligent picture  but it also has an emotional center  writerdirectorstar warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character  and  in turn  we like him and actually care about the story  
  
beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth  the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again   
he hasnt slept in days  nor has he eaten  and  almost instantaneously  he goes insane  
  hes not stark raving mad  not outright  anyway   but hes definitely bonkers  
  its the final weekend of his campaign  and his assistant  murphy  oliver platt  has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto  
  bulworth begins the speech  but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest   
  you mean   one lady asks   the democratic party doesnt care about the african american community    
  well   he shouts  laughing   isnt that obvious   
the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life  he muses later that its a bad thing to make decisions when youre suicidal   he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses  graham beckel  whom he believes to be the hitman  
  bulworth also meets nina  halle berry  with whom he becomes infatuated  
  suddenly  in the short span of this weekend  bulworths nononsense  truth in politics  methods become a national sensation  and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that hes appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences  
beattys work on both sides of the camera is excellent   
his script and direction are both extremely sharp  as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself   
here is a man whos reached his limit  and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure   
i like that the film doesnt take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations  but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich  although the antirich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film    
some of the segments are simply hilarious  such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him   
much of the film is completely absurd  but thats the fun part about it   
its an angry  serious film at the core  but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre   
what adds to this feeling is beattys portrayal of bulworth  this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale  
  beatty is so much fun to watch here  hes always funny  but hes also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions  
  beatty is so good that bulworth  despite his shortcomings as a human being  is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning  
the supporting cast is vast and colorful   
berry is luminous  as always  and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles   
don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses guntoting toddlers to do his dirty work   
oliver platt is an actor who should be careful  for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting  though hes very funny to watch    paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections  
is bulworth offensive   
i suppose some may see it that way   
i wasnt offended by the film  but then again  i hardly care about politics   
i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story   
the film isnt perfect  of course  the ending didnt quite work for me  and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced  although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic    
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film   
bulworth is a smart  uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface
