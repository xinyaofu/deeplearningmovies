linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction  and her being cast as dogmas lead is nothing short of inexplicable  
shes still in fine form as bethany  an abortion clinic worker whos lost her faith  
one night  a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethanys bedroom  
he is metatron  alan rickman   the voice of god  and he needs her help  she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey churchthe fate of the universe depends on it  
god would do it himherself  but heshe is    missing  having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again  
bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the  prophets  jay  jason mewes  and silent bob  kevin smith  doing doubleduty   the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smiths films thus far  
at some point  rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus  the undocumented  and very black   thirteenth apostle   and offers his assistance  as does divine stripper serendipity  salma hayek   
its a wild ride  
theyre in pursuit of loki and bartleby  damon and affleck  respectivelythis is probably the sharpest either has ever been   who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return  
loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates  
at one point  he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets  
its a nasty  guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks   how corrupt are you    
wings of desire this aint  
since debuting with clerks  smith has grown as a director  particularly in terms of working with actors  
  chris rock is this films only weak linkbetween jokes  hes wooden   
his nofrills visual style hasnt changed much over the years  though  dogmas widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations   nor has his writinghis characters still sit around delivering one caustic  hilarious speech after another  
dogma chips away at big religious issuesnamely  the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefseloquently and articulately  but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition  
as well  the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever  
any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum  hurlyburly  anyone    and eventually dogmas pacing goes slack  
a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game  in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings  comes at a point when weve heard enough  
because his change of heart  bartleby is initially the good cop to lokis bad  drives the climax  said rant is given a great deal of screen time  
sure  affleck deserved a big moment  damon steals their scenes together prior   but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated  
like tarantino  smith was a videoage sponge who became a samplemad indie filmmaker  
dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies  including indiana jones and the last crusade  with silent bob doing his best harrison ford  and weird sciencea shit demon attacks our heroes  
smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour  his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical  a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan  catholicism wow    and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished  
i bust  ed   a gut on several occasions  
proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever  
its a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease  for to read it  one actually has to see dogma  
the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christs  martin scorseses  adaptation of nikos kazantzakis controversial novel  in that it is not directly linked to the pictures content but to rumours and heresy  
theres a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime  just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against  
  not one of them had watched it   
every single person refused  
smith and scorsese have a lot in common  and so do the two films in question  because both smiths bethany and scorseses jesus are hollow shells without their faith  
in fact  dogmas denouement  which follows a thrilling showdown thats worth the wait  is a catholic lovein  a veritable recruitment poster  
  i felt sentimental about a religion i dont belong to  
now thats powerful filmmaking   smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god  and that spirituality shines through  
its enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins  
my religion is movies  
when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine  in a roundabout way theyre attacking what i live for  freedom of expression through celluloid  
i therefore feel that  although im no biblethumper  im at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers
