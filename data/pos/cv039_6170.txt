that thing you do  
  r  tom hankss screenwriting and directorial debut  that thing you do   has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment  fun  lively  and ohsonice  
it is the latter quality  however  that becomes a hindrance  for this s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast  
that thing focuses on the wonders  a teen rock band from erie  pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in  when they score a major dance hit called  of course   that thing you do   
the groups members are  naturally a diverse group  theres brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy  johnathon schaech   girlcrazy lenny  steve zahn   the lead guitarist  a goofy  geeky type known only as the bass player  ethan embry   and the films center  guy  tom everett scott   the drummer who has aspirations in jazz  
along for the wonders ride to success is jimmys perpetually neglected galpal  faye  liv tyler   
hanks proves to be a capable writerdirector  deftly recreating the innocent spirit of   which hanks calls  the last innocent year   
the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music  which  like the other recent period music film  grace of my heart  was expressly written for the film  hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunesbut not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger  which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled  its still playing in my mind as i write this   
it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors  eliciting charming  likable work from the entire cast  most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler  who is remarkable in delivering the films biggest and best dramatic moment  
the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early s  they do not appear to be s grungers playacting  retro   
yet for all the light  frothy charms of that thing you do   its nearly nice to a fault  
while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days  there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting  
everyone is so happy  basking in the glow of overnight success  marvelling at it allexcept toward the end  but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness  ending on an appropriately feelgood note  
there isnt much of an edge throughout that thingthe only thing that is remotely edgy is hankss turn as the wonders managerand thus becomes in danger of being so nice its bland  
but a little niceness goes a long way these days  and theres no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do   its just about impossible to hate  
its an inoffensive  enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming  if not singing   that thing you do   quite 
possibly for days  
to paraphrase a passage from the song  though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play  that thing you do
