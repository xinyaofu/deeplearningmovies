will hunting  matt damon  is a natural genius  
for a movie character  thats usually a death sentence  
its a trait associated with what my brother calls  too good for this world  movies  like phenomenon or powder  
forgive me for spoiling the ending  but will doesnt die  
this is no formula movie  
in fact  its quite fresh and original  
its a character study more than anything  and thats not surprising  considering it was written by two actors  damon and costar ben affleck  
will works whatever kind of job he can get  
first hes a janitor  then he works construction  
offscreen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him  
onscreen he hangs out with his friends  picking fights in robust  romanticizedhemingway fashion  
lambeau  stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves   a math professor  learns that the janitor  will  is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics  
having confirmed hes not a fluke or a savant  he does what he can to get will into the education system  
he is firmly rejected  
finally  will lands in jail for one of his fights  
lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him  
will  barely  decides to go for the therapy over prison  
lambeau treats will like a son  
hes proud of  and amazed by  wills accomplishments in mathematics  
he encourages will and tries to give him structure  knowing that  with a little discipline  he could be bigger than einstein  
will isnt really interested in academia  
he knows he would be the best in his field  and therefore spend all of his time in an office  explaining math to people like lambeau  
he would rather work construction  which breaks lambeaus heart  
meanwhile  will attends his mandated therapy sessions  
its not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeaus  a  list  
will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade  and how to keep them from affecting him  
shrink after shrink refuses to return after wills mockery  
lambeaus last hope is his old college roommate  now a psychology teacher at a smalltime community college  
knowing that will is going to try to shred him too  sean  robin williams  agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein  
true to form  will finds seans emotional weakness and attacks  
but unlike the other shrinks  sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions  
like a foster mother with a fussy child  sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride  
like the foster mother  sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach  
robin williams is excellent in this role  
hes not an actor with a great range  but in the right roles he has great depth  
in this movie  as in awakenings  there comes a point when the quiet  shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance  and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes  
williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling  
i have compared will to a foster child and thats not entirely fair  
emotionally  he has a lot to learn  but he is not a child  
he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants  
sean  his girlfriend  his pals  and lambeau all help him grow  but he didnt start out asking for  or particularly needing  help  
his exceptional gift singled him out  and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction  
if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama  
its too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama  but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama  
it is emotionally engaging  but its not quite larger than life  
this isnt a problem per se  but at times i didnt know quite how to take it  
but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie  
a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow  
it doesnt just happen  it takes a good script  good acting  and good direction  
good will hunting has all three  
if you are at all inclined to see it  by all means  go
