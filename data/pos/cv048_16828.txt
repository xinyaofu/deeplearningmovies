when star wars came out some twenty years ago  the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image  
when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars  we see constellations  meteor showers  and cool spaceships  
when han solo goes light speed  the stars change to bright lines  going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point  
cool  
october sky offers a much simpler imagethat of a single white dot  traveling horizontally across the night sky  
was it really only forty years ago  when sputnik was launched  and that before then  no satellites ever existed  
have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a thentechnological achievement  even though it was from the russians  
it sounds hokey  but when that scene occurs near the beginning of october sky  i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam  played by jake gyllenhaal  
determined to make a dent in the space race  he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them  
it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket  
when lovely teacher miss riley  played by laura dern   suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair  we know exactly who is going to win  
but the joy in a film like this is in the little details  
for example  homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class  
if he has any strengths whatsoever  it is an undeterring vision  and a good organizer  
it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school  who knows more about rocket science than he does  
it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property  that is  the entire coalmining town   he must walk eight miles one way  just to set up the rockets  which will fail  fail  fail  and fail again  
homers dad is played by chris cooper  a favorite actor of mine since lone star  
here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in matewan  instead of organizing union rallies  he is the head of the coalminers  who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions  
this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year  note how multidimensional his character is  
he is his sons last nemesis  as one who most likely interferes with his sons dreams  
but he truly loves his son  and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how  
through coalmining  
because of his character  we can see how far weve come  
the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us  
we dont understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family  
the paradigm was shifting under the fathers feet  and he knew of no other life  
so october sky  far from being merely a feelgood inspirational film  offers much food for thought  
and this is the best type of inspirational film  the one that you take something with you  
btw  the final image of the film is just as simple  is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontalmoving white dot against the nightsky background  
another commonplace image  to be sure  but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago
