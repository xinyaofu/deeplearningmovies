i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory  
this was  of course  a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this  
not only did i get to see an advance screening  i was able to see an advance screening of a  very good  movie  
the very fastpaced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher  a fasttalking  witty  comical taxi driver in new york city  
gibsons performance is terrific  and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films  
gibson again teams up with richard donner  as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick  and this time around  the combination works even better  
the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique  
try to imagine a toneddowned version of travis bickle who  this time around  is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy coverups  
if you can imagine that  then youve basically got jerry fletcher  
in many ways  i was surprised by this movie  
to begin with  i was surprised at how good it was  
dont get me wrong  its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring  but it was a very enjoyable movie  
secondly  i was surprised at mel gibsons performance  
he provided a fantastic performance  
the previews of this film led me to believe it was an allout action flick  which after viewing  it was almost the opposite in a certain sense  
gibsons character has an almost uncountable number of oneliners  hilarious situations  and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film  
for instance  jerrys apartment  and especially his security  is memorable  
and last  i was surprised at how good the plot is  
writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story  and when watching this film  you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers farfetched  or so they seem at first  conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions  
mel gibson isnt the only standout in the film  
julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton  the department of justice employee who cant seem to stay away from jerry fletcher  who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories  
he also seems obsessed and in love with her  
but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories  she shrugs him and his beliefs off  continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him  
jerry  obviously determined to continually seek out the truth  continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory  which will be printed in his newsletter  same title as the movie   
although he only has five subscribers  he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work  and publishes his next edition  
very soon after he does so  he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr  jonas  patrick stewart   
after barely escaping alive  jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust  alice sutton  
the remainder of the film is almost always fastpaced and full of action and suspense  with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy  
and more along the way  the audience  and alice  learn more and more about jerrys life  
many things are explained throughout this film  both to the characters and to the audience  
for instance  the meaning of the book  the catcher in the rye  and its ties to assassins  the reason lone gunmen have three names  e  g  
lee harvey oswald and james earl ray   and the real truth behind the grateful dead  
make sure listen closely throughout the film  as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above  
definitely  when conspiracy theory hits theaters august th  make sure you are standing in line to see it  
i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film  especially if you are into an actionthriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations  
and even if you arent  you should still like this film
