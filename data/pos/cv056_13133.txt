the disney studios has its formula for annual  fulllength animated features down so pat that its hard to remember which one youre watching at any given moment  
  mulan   their th animated adventure  is the latest case in point  
once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character  female as usual  disney is one of the few studios whose heroinesariel  belle  pocahontas  and now mulanget equal screen time with their heroes in recent years   
add the requisite love interest and a wisecracking sidekick or two  pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes  an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror  a rousing anthem  a cutesy  montagebacked crowd pleaser   pose a few threats to our engaging lead  and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits

kids will no doubt go gaga over  mulan   or at least the fast food tieins   but familiarity can  after a while  leave grownupsthis reviewer includedwishing for a little more

like disneys previous entries   mulan  is slow to make its mark  
the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element  a madcap dragon wannabe  in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth  courtesy eddie murphys animated vocal talents   plays like an inappropriate if necessary  formulawise  afterthought  
however  after about an hour everything comes together and the formula  like it or not  clicks  
highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snowcovered pass  which  due to the sophistication of todays computergenerated imagery  is hard to tell from the real thing   a memorable  showstopping musical interlude   ill make a man out of you   penned by matthew wilder and david zippel   and last but not least  mulan herself  
voiced by mingna wen  mulan is disneys strongest female character to date  
when hordes of huns pour over chinas great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace  the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army  
since mulans father is infirm  but proud  the highspirited mulan steals her fathers armor and  incognito  signs up to face the mongolian menace  
attracted to  but not distracted by  her commanding officer shang  b  d  
wong   mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts  wit  and physical ability  
shes a woman of the s a couple of millennia ahead of her time
