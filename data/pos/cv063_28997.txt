susan grangers review of  the closet   miramax films  
in this hilarious french farce  a shy  boring accountant  daniel auteil  named francois pignon discovers hes going to be fired from his job at a condom factory  
lonely and distraught  he contemplates suicide  
but then he runs into belone  michel aumont   an elderly homosexual neighbor  who suggests a  sex discrimination  lawsuit to intimidate management  
as evidence  belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leatherclad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignons boss  
when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory  not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man  
his lusty supervisor  michele laroque  is so intrigued that she wonders if  perhaps  she could change his sexual preferences  
even his exwife  alexandra vandernoot  and indifferent teenage son  stanislas crevillen  drop their disdain  
but not everyone is enchanted  
a mucho macho coworker felix  gerard depardieu   a selfrighteous homophobe  is stunned and repulsed when hes forced by the pr director  thierry lhermite  to grovel and court pignons friendship or risk losing his own job  
writerdirector francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness  veering offtrack only occasionally into pedophilia  
daniel auteuil   the widow of saintpierre   is delightful  particularly with a blownup condom perched on his head  riding on a float in a gay pride parade  and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained  and effective  performances  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    the closet  is a frankly sexual  adult   
its so clever  in fact  that hollywood is already planning to remake it in english  like  la cage aux folles
