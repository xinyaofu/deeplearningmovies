youve seen this moment before  recently  a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing  
the difference is that when it happens to lili taylors nell in the haunting  we dont care  
the hero of the sixth sense  a young boy named cole  is a rich creation  and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike  
the seasons have changed since an expatient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe  willis  in the comfort of his own bedroom  
desperate to get his career back on track  even at the expense of his crumbling marriage  to williams  of rushmore   malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole  osment   
the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolms wouldbe killer  scars on his body  antisocial behaviour  and the reluctance to reveal a big secret  
only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies  and hospitalized as a result  does he divulge to malcolm  in a spinetingling scene  that he sees dead people walking among us  all the time  
malcolm assumes  and given his profession  reasonably so  that cole is schizophrenic  not psychic  but the sincerity in coles anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures  
he will instead pursue the supernatural angle  becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole  who lives with his single mother  lynn  collette   in the process  
the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist  
  though shyamalan does  somewhat unforgiveably  crib the selfrearranging kitchen business from the latter   
its far more heartwarming than frightening  and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks  
cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown  but theyre not out to harm him  reallythey just want to be heard  even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler  
perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us  at first  than they really are because were looking at the situation through the eyes of an eightyearold  
thats right  willis  for the first time in years  gives up the spotlight to his costar  
we appreciate malcolms domestic dilemma  but we identify with cole  recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed  
both actors deliver immensely likable performances  and their dynamic is manifest  
willis convinces us that hes a doctor  something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night  
osment is phenomenal  a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do  
the sixth sense  atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer  tak fujimoto  is actually a dramaits spooky  effective ad campaign is misleading  
only because i was expecting something different did i noticerather  feelthe movies running time  which is just shy of two hours  
the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly  its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait  
im not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof  but i admired its audacity
