close your eyes for a moment  if you will  and imagine the sound of stephen reas gaelic brogue  silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness  
a lackadaisical  naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols  
an acerbic  singsong metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess  a clockwork orange   
a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile  like those out of  delicatessen   or  the tin drum   
imagine all of that  and youll get a good sense of what you can expect from  the butcher boy   
imagine that and more  
neil jordans latest film  stars  rea in more ways than one  
rea  the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordans  the crying game   contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady  a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the s  
but its his walltowall narration as the butcher boy of the title  da bradys son  francis  that makes reas  performance  worth watching  worth listening to  
and thats only half the fun  
playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is  without a doubt  a revelation  
for as much as reas voiceover permeates almost every scene of  the butcher boy   owens commands virtually every frame  
its impossible to take your eyes off him  
with his crop of carrotcolored hair  ruddy complexion  and overall grubby appearance  francie brady is an unlikely hero  refusing to be done in by his alcoholic  trumpetplaying father  his depressive  suicidal mother  or the neighboring  bespectacled monster known as mrs  nugent  fiona shaw   
in fact  everything was ok until  the nugent  came to town  
now  she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe  alan boyle  as the looming commie menace   the butcher boy  is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many   
  pigs   screams mrs  nugent at the brady menagerie  
  youre all pigs   
its the start of many a related image  
after ma brady is shipped off to the  garage  for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many  francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians  the lone ranger  and other comicbook characters  
squealing like a stuck pig  francie does  the likes o that  on the nugents living room floor  and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for  boney arsed bogmen   where his ever fertile imaginationand clever chicaneryrunneth over  
director jordans vivid treatment of pat mccabes nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing  dark comedy littered with surreal touches  such as sin  ad oconnor playing the virgin mary   
its not as outlandish as the trailers make out  instead  this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys  schoolboy chums in real life   allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior  
its bleak and its black but its fundamentally very funny  
rea talks us through it  beautifully  and owens drags us though it  admirably  and  in tandem with jordans sure hand  theirs are contributions to make  the butcher boy  a film worth savoring
