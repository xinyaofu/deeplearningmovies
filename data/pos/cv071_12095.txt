zero effect gets its title from the main character  daryl zero  bill pullman   although we dont understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film  
zero is a private investigator  perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived  at least hed like to think so   
however  hes a socially inept being  and eccentric in every possible way  this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are  
zeros accomplice is steve arlo  ben stiller   a  normal  guy who does the business side of the job  hes the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zeros greatness as an investigator  
the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zeros talents to soontobe client gregory stark  ryan oneal   
it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box  and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about  
zero takes the case  and the plot thickens  
his path leads to a young  pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan  kim dickens   
despite her luminous and seeminglyharmless presence  she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark  
through his investigations  zero learns why  but not without developing feelings for gloria  feelings that  because of his reclusive behavior  are new and confusing to him  
i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film  
i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators  and  every once in a while  a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away  actually  no private eye film has ever reached chinatowns greatness   
zero effect  which is jake kasdans first effort as writerdirector  is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts  its an original  funny  and completely involving motion picture  
with so many cliches available to this genre  i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them  
but he didnt just successfully avoid flaws  he has created a great film here  one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment  
take  for starters  the great cast of characters  
pullman is terrific as zero  showing a comic flair that i really havent seen from him since spaceballs  
zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here  the fact that hes an almost exaggeratedly twisted  emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe  
pullmans performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance  and the occasional voiceover as hes going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious  
ben stiller is also a very funny individual  hes the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny  
  ill shoot you   he says to stark at one point  
  i have a gun  and everything   
his character is also welldrawn  with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend  angela featherstone  who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job  
oneal also gives his character a bit of depth  and kim dickens  last seen  and underused  in mercury rising  gets a chance to show us her talent here  giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs  
i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film  
kasdans humor is of the best kind  soft spoken  and mostly dialoguedriven  though there are some great visual jokes   
its the kind of humor thats funny even after youve seen it five or six times  
theres one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is  an how that makes him such a great detective  
what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed  or standing motionlessly  with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face  his eyes pointing to something off camera  but obviously to nothing in particular  
i cant convey to you how funny this is  but what makes it great film making is that it has a point  scenes like this are frequent  and they provide solid characterization of zero  
as a side note  i dont consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy  not to sound elitist   i find things funny that many do not  and vice versa  
there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film  and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it  
i have a feeling the humor here wont appeal to everyone  but theres certainly enough story and character development to keep anyones interest  
jake kasdan  son of writerdirector lawrence kasdan  is only  years old  
i found this out after seeing the film  and i cant remember ever being so impressed with a film maker  
his direction is stylish without being pretentious  and his writing is mature  full  and developed  
zero effect is the kind of film that ill buy for my collection  smart  original films like this are rare as it is  but this one actually has a heart and a soul  
at the end of the film  i was involved in the characters  and i was satisfied with the outcome  
and  with kasdans undeniable talent at such a young age  all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future
