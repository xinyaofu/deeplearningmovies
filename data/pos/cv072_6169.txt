the long kiss goodnight  r  meryl streep tried it and failed  
even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her wellbared assets  
however  geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight  a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband  renny harlin  
davis plays samantha caine  a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years  
with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey  samuel l  jackson   she slowly remembersand reclaimsher past as charly baltimore  toughasnails cia operative  
needless to say  with the reappearance of samanthacharly comes the appearance of an assortment of nogoodniks out to erase more than her memory  
shane black netted a cool  mil for his script  im not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag  but for what its worth  it delivers the goods  
like blacks previous work  such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout  the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny  quirky dialogue  
the humor especially works well in this case  for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously  
but theres no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell  who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car    
while ice skating  
jackson and davis make a good team  
jackson is funny as ever as ever  in fact  his spirited line deliveries  especially when he first appears  are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction  
as good as he is  the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis  who shows much promise as an action heroine  
what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesnt take herself too seriously  
she is obviously in on the joke  slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation  
this is not to say that she doesnt need worksometimes she lays on the  toughness  a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature  
but should the public embrace the film and  in turn  the notion of a kickass female  davis could have found her special niche  
it seems as if davis and harlins first collaboration  the middling pirate epic cutthroat island  was just a dress rehearsal  albeit a very costly one  for long kiss  in which the wifehusband team hit their action stride  
anyone simply looking for a fun  escapist entertainment that requires littletono thinking will find this film to be a morethanwelcome kiss
