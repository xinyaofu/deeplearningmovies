well  i know that stallone is  years old now  but in daylight he doesnt look it  
daylight is a great disaster movie  
if youve seen cliffhanger  youll know stallones character already  
a guy with a bad past  but is in the right place at the wrong time  
a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying  very  flammable toxic waste  
a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball  and what a fire ball it was   
stallone  a former emergency medical service man  is chauffeuring a rich couple around  when they reach the outside of the tunnel  before the explosion  
then   minutes into the movie  boom  
from here on  the plot takes a back seat  and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged  
most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat  
there are a few melodramatic parts here  but  they tend to work out well  
there is no general antagonist in this film  but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that  
daylight is a great film  i saw a nonmatinee showing of it  and i thought it was worth every penny  
the characterizations are mostly flat  one dimesional  but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters  
rob cohen  dragonheart  does a great job with this film
