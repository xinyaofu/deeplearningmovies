no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordans harrowing  humorous  horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabes novel about young lad francie bradys  eamonn owens  descent into madness in s ireland  
on one hand  it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character  unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs  nugent  fiona shaw   
on another hand  i found it difficult to laugh at some of francies darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick  needy child  having been raised by a drunken father  stephen rea  and a suicidal mother  aisling osullivan   
on yet another hand  i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his  for lack of a better word   bad  deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them  
however  the butcher boys power is undeniable  and the film as a whole is unforgettableperhaps because it is so disturbing  
what makes it so unsettling is the francies overall winkwink yet matteroffact attitude about everything  expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie  rea again   
think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs  and youll sort of understand  
anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens  love francie or hate him  you cannot take your eyes off of owens  
the butcher boy truly is a twisted  unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable  
in the lobby after the screening  i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was  i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust   that movie was so unfunny   
  i didnt know what to expect  
its like something you chase for so long  but then you dont know how to react when you get it  
i still dont know how to react
