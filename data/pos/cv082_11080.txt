a big surprise to me  
the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off  but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues  john belushi  is such a dumb idea i really had no hope  
they replaced him just fine  
not with john goodman  he didnt do much of anything  but with the brilliant actor joe morton  who can really sing  
the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant  whos ten  
this was another of my fears for the film  but hes a really good dancer  and plays a mean harmonica  although he may have been dubbed   
things that intellectually had bothered me before  like no mission from god  everyone being richer  it not being filmed in chicago  gave me no problems at all  
im quite pleased that there were less car pileups  because they meant less music  and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing  
theres a few early crashes  and then one huge pileup  but after that it all stops  
its just the music  
one of my problems with the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him  but theres no problems with this  
the music is all as good as ever  tons of great musicians showing up  with the exception of johnny lang  who cant sing  all the musicians do a great job  
the only real problems i had was the special effects  
these were superfluous and a waste of money  
since the film isnt doing very well  they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel  which i want to see  
the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide
