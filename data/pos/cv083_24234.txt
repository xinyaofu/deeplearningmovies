after having heard so many critics describe  return to me  as an oldfashioned hollywood romance  i kept asking myself going into this movie  what exactly is an oldfashioned hollywood romance  
what made  return to me  oldfashioned and oldhollywood  
was it the tunes from sinatra  etc   legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on  
was it the glamorous  sophisticated feel  
the charisma of the two leads  
even now i cant say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer  because i havent see that many oldfashioned hollywood romances  
i dont think any of the romances ive seen have been classified as such  
which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics   return to me  was oldfashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic  the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider  
it was traditional  magical  
we knew it couldnt be too daring  or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in  
it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity  tenderness  and love  from director bonnie hunt  that it couldnt help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings  
the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunts direction  
from the very first birds eye view of chicago  zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland  david duchovny   accompanied by the  return to me  ballad  by whom    we can tell were in for something sweet  
the scenes between the characters are endearing  truthful  with just a hint of fantasy  
real people dont act that way  real people arent that nice  
we know all this  and yet we want to believe in these folks existence  
the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale  but hunts rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal  
everything is ordinaryyet beautifulin this film  
from the festive little family restaurant to grace  minnie driver  and bobs wardrobes  
from the eloquent  notinahurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints  
from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen  the most beautiful part  
  return to me  has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family  the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist  
we care for them  laugh with them  cry with them  were concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father  
whatever hunt did  she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors  
disappointingly  david alan griers charlie  however much i like him  was the most flatlywritten  
duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona  with the help of his fellow costars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder  
instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of  the xfiles   
duchovny  who is excellent at understatement and selfdeprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen  
minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet  innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer  
though an unlikely pair  duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses  
while  return to me  functions remarkably as a laughoutloud comedy  a romantic scenic tour through chicago  and a tearjerker  the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop  
the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wifes heart  
we already know that theres going to be a happy ending  we feel like we spend the entire film  however enjoyably  in a straight line going towards that point  
as a result bob and grace click almost too quicklyyes  i know shes supposed to have his exwifes heart and everythingit seems too effortless  
the main subject is a love story  and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters  whose story might not have that much meat after all   
however  in the spirit of  return to me   it wont do to be too picky about how  old  hollywood tells its stories  
i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt  
it shows  
the bottom line   return to me  is nothing remarkable  and yet its sweetness  sincerity  and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadnt imagined
