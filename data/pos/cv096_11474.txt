everyone knows someone like giles death  stuffy  arrogant  set in his ways  and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with  progress   
giles is a writer  but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis  
his house looks like an immaculate museum  with no television  microwave  word processor  or other technological gadgets  only the electric lights betray that hes living in the twentieth century  not the nineteenth  
this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype  but john hurt  in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career  turns  erstwhile fogy  giles into a threedimensional human being  
despite his tunnel vision  its impossible not to like the man  especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune  love  
and  as giles discovers during the course of this amusing  warmhearted motion picture  its possible to find the object of ones affection in the most unusual places  
giles  who is a widower and a recluse  does not frequent the cinema  but when he learns that an e  m  forster film is playing at the local theater  he screws up his courage and decides to go  
what he doesnt realize is that the movie house is showing two films  the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii  
a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress  
just as giles is about to leave  however  he notices ronnie bostock  jason priestley   and  suddenly  its love at first sight  
giles is enraptured  and the moment hotpants college ii is over  he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia  including teen magazines and video tapes  
  in order to watch those tapes  giles must buy a vcr  but he initially doesnt realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr   
eventually  not satisfied with being the worlds foremost authority on bostock  giles boards a plane and travels to long island  where his idols home is located  
bostock is away when giles arrives  but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnies supermodel girlfriend  audrey  fiona loewi   
eventually  the actor arrives home and  impressed with giles demeanor and intelligence  he begins to rely on the older mans advice  
but  while giles affection runs deep  ronnies feelings are less constant  
love and death on long island is a comedy  and a very funny one at that  
in fact  for its first half  the film is nearlyperfect  
it suffers a falloff once giles reaches new york  and the ending  with its nonetoosubtle homosexual overtones  is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it  
in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom  writerdirector richard kwietniowski  adapting from the novel by gilbert adair  is  on target  
in the process  he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles  but says a few things about the transforming power of love  even if it is unrequited  
from start to finish  this is clearly hurts movie  hes in almost every frame  
its a role that the veteran actor must have relished  because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure  and does so by means of dialogue delivery  body language  and everchanging facial expressions  
jason priestley  cashing in on his beverly hills  image  is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie  
he is charismatic  and its not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie  
meanwhile  solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the alwaysreliable maury chaykin  
love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one  a social commentary  it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment   a buddy picturelove story  ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days   and a  fish out of water  tale  victorian relic giles forced into the modern world   
yet  despite the many laughs love and death offers  it never takes cheap shots  
it has a vibrant  beating heart  and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile
