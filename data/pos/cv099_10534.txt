call it touched by a demon  
gregory hoblits fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual  horrific twist  
if marketed properly  this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim  dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven  
in fact  theres even a little twin peaks to be found here  albeit with the lions share of the weirdness distilled out  
  remember bob   
the biggest failing of fallen is that  although its consistently interesting  its not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope  
a serial killer  elias koteas  has been on the loose in philadephia  but detective john hobbes  denzel washington   the noblest man on the police force  has brought him to justice  
now  during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber  the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes   what goes around really goes around   
shortly thereafter  he begins to sing  time is on my side  as hes taken on his last walk  
minutes later  the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead  
but for hobbes  the nightmare is just beginning  because reese wasnt a normal psychopath  he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel  
and  with reeses death  azazel is free to hop from body to body  murdering and wreaking havoc at will  
only hobbes and a pretty  female theology teacher  embeth davidtz  have an inkling of what theyre up against  
the rest of the cops  including hobbes partner  jonesy  john goodman   lou  james gandolfini   a newcomer to the department  and lieutenant stanton  donald sutherland   dont have a clue  and  as a result  they are in mortal danger  
as depicted by hoblit  primal fear  and cinematographer newton thomas sigel  philadelphia is a dark  dreary place  a gothic city rather than a modern one  
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown  
the most famous landmark to appear isnt the liberty bell or independence hall  its genos steaks  
shadows and night scenes abound  
the days are cloudy and unpromising  
this is the kind of setting where its easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men  
fallens plot is brimming with potential  not all of which is realized  
somehow  i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise  
but the level of terror  like that of gore  is kept in check  
nevertheless  there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks  
the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual  
of the several dozen actors to play azazel  the best is by far elias koteas  exotica  crash   who  despite only being on screen for about ten minutes  gives a fantastically charged performance  
john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself  although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick  
sadly  however  these two are the only ones who excel  
everyone else  including denzel washington  is boring  
washingtons flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film  
its not that hes bad per se  but hes not very interesting  
theres no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character  and that keeps us distanced  however slightly  from hobbes  
as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop  and as his lifeordeath chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate  i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was  
washingtons subdued approach is part of the reason for this  i never felt a sense of urgency  
however  at least washington was believable  which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz  schindlers list  and donald sutherland  
to be fair  the flaws in their characters arent all actingrelated  neither stanton nor gretta milano are wellwritten  
that said  however  theres nothing inspired about either davidtzs or sutherlands work  
both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts  as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multidimensional individual  
narratively  fallen has a few glaring weaknesses  
although the plot proceeds with a convoluted  gamelike structure  it uses a denzel washingtonsupplied voiceover to overexplain matters  
at times  this is actually helpful  and it has a use beyond the obvious  but there are occasions when ponderous lines like  i like the night  sometimes you come face to face with yourself  become a little hard to swallow  
in addition  fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland  generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel  
however  despite the negatives  im still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending  which i loved  
the final scenes are startling  audacious  and unexpected  
its not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did  
at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes  fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself  
this is not a great motion picture  but  considering how bad most january releases are  its a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours  
and  whatever you do  dont walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll
