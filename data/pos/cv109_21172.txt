not since oliver stones natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary  and not since david cronenberg has a socalled mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility  
while finchers films have never suffered from a lack of shock value  his major character killings in both alien  and seven are fine examples   fight club marks the distillation of his pitchblack comedic sensibility  see s the game  into something like a definitive statement  
jack  norton  acting as both narrator and protagonist  is your typical cubicle clone  whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia  
on the offhand advice of a doctor  he sits in on grouptherapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer  
here he meets bob  marvin lee aday  aka meat loaf   a canceremasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia  
strangely  the release he finds while sobbing on bobs breasts allows him to sleep at night  at least until a fellow grouptherapy  tourist  named marla singer  carter  comes along to ruin things for him  forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity  
later  he meets tyler durden  pitt   a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life  
one night  after his ikea furnished condo explodes  dont ask youll just have to see the movie  awright    he is goaded by tyler into a fight  and damned if it doesnt feel good  
it is pure  raw existence  a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison  
he moves into tylers squalid abandoned mansion  and they form the titular organization  an underground therapy group where men bond with bareknuckle savagery and very few rules  the first two of which are  dont talk about fight club   
armed with charisma and an attractive anticorporate philosophy  tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of whitecollar slaves and deadend mcemployees  
resentment creeps into jacks heart  made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla  
funded by a frivolous lawsuit  tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem  
their initially juvenile pranks  like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads  quickly evolve into something more like sedition  and jack fears that things have gone sour  
it is after this point  when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original  that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist  
it is so contrived and so conventional compared to what precedes it that everything which follows  including the ending  becomes far less interesting  
its a major  though not fatal  flaw  and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher  it feels like a copout  
fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people  
in the early going  it has a downright dangerous feel  it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul  and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it  
ill be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs dont spring up here and there  and ill be even more amazed if fincher isnt vilified for it by the same humorless witchhunters that are currently after oliver stone  
they neednt bother  because fight club is less a message movie than finchers elaborate attempt at a joke  
tyler durden  for all his dionysian allure  is really nothing more than the logical  and far less hypocritical  extrapolation of all those selfhelp gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their mefirst gospel of selfactualization  
in this context  the joke works  but like the latest columbine joke  some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh  and others wont  
hopefully  though  their silly moral outrage wont spoil the joke for the rest of us
