review by jamahl epsicokhan  
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesnt have a winning side and a losing side  
in a nuclear confrontation  everybody loses  and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire worldassuming the world survives  
the ideaand perhaps the only real optionis to avoid war at all costs  
this is the theme of sidney lumets  failsafe   a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  
  failsafe  takes place during the heart of the cold war  the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis   when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word  communism  
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  
five u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner  but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  
suddenly out of contact  and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives  the bomber pilots cannot be recalled  and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  
a great deal of  failsafe  s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russias bordersat any cost  
the plot is compelling  and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios  
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails  
general bogan  frank overton   taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself  henry fonda   is powerlessthe fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated  preprogrammed system that may not be stoppable  simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a nowin situation winnable  
the events in  failsafe  are fascinating because theyre anything but predictable  but the real reason  failsafe  works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot  
a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war  communism  the cold war  and the united states role in all of it  
most of this is through the films use of the character groeteschele  walter matthau   an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who  incidentally  is on the presidents advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war  
many of the films most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices  
early in the film  he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of  strategy  in a nuclear assault to  minimize  casualties  
  whats the difference between  million and  million dead   
a guest asks impatiently  
  forty million   groeteschele responds wryly  
the problem with groetescheles mindset is that he  believes  nuclear combat to be a viable method of war  
the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals  
groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over  
yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off  as general black  dan oherlihy  has often recommended  
on the contraryaccording to groeteschele  that would lead to russia having  more  nuclear weapons than the u  s   which would clearly put america at a disadvantage  
such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race  
  failsafe  clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war  and  likewise  it becomes a central theme in the film  
why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over  
is it wise  
is it even logical  
no  not really  
although  failsafe  is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism  there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial  onesided sort of way  
again  this is achieved through groeteschele  who is easily the films most important character in terms of the largertheme significance  
in addition to providing the central  pronuclear war  voice that the film warns against  he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism  
the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib  
one of groetescheles  logical  trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that its merely absurd  
he labels the average marxist an  unfeeling  calculating machine  that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself  
groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u  s  drops the warhead on moscow  the soviets will  instantly  surrender  for to retaliate would invite countermeasures that would further destroy russias home soilwhich must be preserved at all costs  
groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions  general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revengeas any normal person would  
the irony here is groetescheles own mechanical theorizing  
he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesnt even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns  
once the film makes it evident that turning the u  s  bombers will be impossible  the question becomes what the  consequences  of destroying moscow will be  
just how will the soviet unions leader react  and what can the president do to convey his best intentions  
  just  how  does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an  mishap    
with the help of his translator buck  larry hagman   the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader  in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity  with lumets long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame  exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader  
without getting into too much detail  i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly  yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances  
  that is  as sensible as a nuclear  incident  can probably be   
it does accomplish what it must  it avoids an allout war  something that simply isnt possible because of its alltooreal consequences  
dramatically  the ending is quite powerful  and the use of oherlihys character as the symbolic  matador   providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the films opening   is particularly appropriate  
  failsafe  is a production of a major hollywood studio  released by columbia pictures   and it has the structure of a hightension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film  
nevertheless  under lumets direction and walter bernsteins intelligent adaptation of burdicks and wheelers novel  the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded  
the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming  
but it was the conscious  human choice to  initialize  this automatic arming that  failsafe  also finds dangerous  
in retrospect  the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century  
its just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down  rather than continuing groetescheles dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown
