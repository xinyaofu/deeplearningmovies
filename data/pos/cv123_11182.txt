andrew lloyd webbers musicals  preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice  present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time  
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as  oklahoma    or the slapstickness of shows like  a funny thing happened on the way to the forum   
they instead tackle hot issues from our past  and view them differently  and pack them together with redundant  catchy music  as well as thoughtful lyrics  
like  jesus christ superstar   which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective  in the cool tune  superstar   a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didnt spread his message wider    evita  takes an inventive stance on its topic  this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator  juan per  n  eva  who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention  much like the woman playing her  madonna  although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent  among other things   
  evita  deals with the rise and fall of eva per  n  a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan  jonathan pryce   then died at the young age of   creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di  the two do share a bit in common  although it wasnt like di slept to  the top    
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals  but they always have a point for doing it  
here  they wish to expose her for what she is  but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks  her lying  and covering up for her fascist husband  but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions  and her death was very sad  
its also a musical  with almost no words not unsung  
the film plays like a rock opera  much like their  jesus christ superstar   with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals  even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics  which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience  but also a very entertaining one  
after all  this is a musical  and webbers musicals never undermine this  
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth  walking on a fine line between the both  and never stumbling on either side  
this is why the beginning of  evita  is kind of a letdown  
okay  it is a letdown  
im not saying the opening moments are bad  because theyre pretty good  
but what comes after is a lifeless  unentertaining  and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer  jimmy nail  into taking eva to buenos aires after a onenight stand  
in the musical  its a fun  energetic sequence  culiminating in the show stopper   buenos aires   which is also lifeless  
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer  instead of her leaving him  where she ends up singing the sad tune   another suitcase in another hall   which was meant for a later character  screwed over by eva  
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft  seeming like parker and oliver stone  who adapted it for the screen  are afraid to present her for what she is  even while its being narrated by a hater of evas  the omnipotent  antonio banderas   who presents her in a negative light  
for a while  it looks like alan parker cant pull it off  
however  the film pulls itself together in a flash  and after that song is over  and the giddily nihilistic song  goodbye and thank you   where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend  is magnificent  darkly comical  and just gleeful  
from this point on  the film is hypnotic  satisfying  and satirical  
no more punches are thrown  and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact  
we see eva woo and marry juan  get him out of jail  rise to stardom  falter a bit  come back  and then gradually die of cancer  i think it was because of cancer   
more importantly  many of the themes from the musical carry on with this  as well as some fillinginthegaps reconnassaince work  
juan  who is pretty underwritten in the musical  is given some extra scenes  and exposed as what he was for eva  an accessory  
a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan  and understand his sadness more than we did before  
from the  goodbye and thank you  number on  the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation  and saved a government  even while it left the nations people downtrodden  
but despite this  the nation still loved eva  and when she slipped into death  the world mourned her because she was a star  
thats when our narrator  ch   comes out to show that she wasnt the great woman she really was  and expose her fame  
describing this character is difficult  mainly because he has no real realistic background  hes said to be based on the revolutionary ch  guevera  but the two probably could have never met  like they do in the film   but he serves as a perspective on eva  but even his perspective cant help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death  
alan parker  no stranger to bizarre musicals  hes done  fame    the committments    bugsy malone   and  pink floyd the wall   the latter which is absolutely brilliant   nails the film  exposing everything for what it is  
we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should  by the way it is presented  
his direction is manipulative for a reason  to show the mourning for what it is  
and there is energy throughout  with lots of bright colors  and scenes which are cinematically entertaning  as well as enriching and deep  such as the balcony scene where she sings  dont cry for me  argentina   and her death sequence  which is poignant becuase of how sad it is  
madonnas golden globe winning performance is much like the movie  starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly  remaning there for the rest of the film  
at the beginning  she looks like shes too busy concentrating on her singing to act  but she eventually gets it right  though never really getting the presence of  say  patti lupone  who did the role in its american premiere back in the late s   
her death  though  is brilliant  
her singing could be better though  
i know she took lessons to improve her range and all  but it still sounds like shes trying to hard  
she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding  like    patti 
lupone  i heard her sing on an old  evita  cd  and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her   
but its generally very good  although not up to the brilliance the role really requires  
antonio banderas  who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days  im one of the few people who thinks he rocks   is extremely comanding in his performance  presenting a lovable narrator  
his singing is very good  though nothing compared to the original  mandy patinkin  
he does have a pretty good singing voice  and a great range  
and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome  although very brief at times  in his role as juan  seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade  
although it gets off to a rocky start   rocky  s polite for what it really is   it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical  
like the other musical released in   woody allens  everyone says i love you    its a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead  but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance
