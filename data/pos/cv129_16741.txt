the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any mans life  especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances  
thematically in cinema  love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters  it is rare  however  for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benignis neoclassic drama  life is beautiful  
through a central cast of father  mother  and son  benigni demonstrates the wonderful  undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times  
life  is  beautiful for guido orefice  roberto benigni  directing himself here for the sixth time in his career   an italian jew  master con man  and aspiring waiter extraordinaire  
living in s italy  he lives a carefree life of good fortune  it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora  nicoletta braschi   
although dora is already engaged  guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead  the two have a child named joshua  giorgio cantarini   
unfortunately for the happy family  the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps  
it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movies theme of family love becomes the strongest  
although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm  he relaxes the role to ensure his sons happiness  
now  instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora  he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right  
benignis performance is truly a wellrounded one  and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year  
the supports are all strong as well  but the movie truly excels in its script  
life is beautiful is a selfproclaimed fable  one which tells its story in grand  twopart fashion  
in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a  saturday night live  spinoff  a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot  but in the movies second half the scripts circular nature becomes admirably obvious  
characters make reprise appearances in fine form  and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plots outcome  
in all  fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture  and novice moviewatchers may take this opportunity to see their first  artsy  film  
life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone  and above all is a fine thematic picture
