while watching wes andersons rushmore  it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer  the films antihero  was not written with jason schwartzman in mind  
the young actor  making his film debut as a  year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman  
schwartzman plays max  a student who is more interested in his extracurricular activities  such as writing edgy plays like  serpico  and being president of the rushmore beekeepers  but sees his grades suffer as a result  
on the brink of being thrown out  he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross  olivia williams  and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume  the great bill murray  to build an aquarium  on rushmores baseball field  in her honour  
unfortunately for everyone involved  blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well  which gets in the way of maxs plans to woo her  
max is one of the bestwritten characters weve yet seen in the s  and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age  
as everyone else has probably already pointed out  he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman  although i was reminded more of paul from  the wonder years   from a visual standpoint  at least   
hopefully  if he avoids typecasting as weird  quirky lonertypes he should earn himself a good career  
bill murray is his equal as blume  displaying a depth we havent yet seen from him  
while this isnt his best performance  that honour goes to groundhog day  he is still terrific here  
williams isnt given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray  but still does fine work  
rushmore seems to go just a little too long but  while it isnt a perfect film  it is a definate mustsee for anyone who wants to see that rarity  an american comingofage film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality  
anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should  with any luck  rise to even greater success
