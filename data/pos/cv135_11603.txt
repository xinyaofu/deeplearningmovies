as with his other stateside releases  jackie chans latest chopsocky vehicle  mr  nice guy  is contrived  blockheaded  and lacking in narrative logic  
but also like those other films  it is a highly enjoyable ride  
once again  chans screenwriters  here edward tang and fibe ma  have taken the easy way out and named their stars character simply jackie  with no last name  
this jackie is a worldclass chef who cohosts a popular cooking show on australian television  
of course  jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist  and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporters  gabrielle fitzpatrick  expose of a drug dealing ring  
other plot details  involving a videotape and a biker gang  are irrelevant  in fact  as is the case with most chan films  the plot itself is just about irrelevant  
the sole purpose of mr  nice guys existence are chans comic fight scenes  and those here do not disappoint  
director samo hung  who has a cameo role   a longtime collaborator of chans  does not waste any time putting chan in action  diving headon into a wild chasefightshootout after a brief cooking show prologue  
other impressive set pieces follow  most notably a chase in a mall  which directly leads to some frenzied  if cliched  can you say fruit cart    business involving a runaway carriage  and an extended latefilm sequence at a construction site  in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards  cement mixers  and a deadly buzzsaw  
none of the action sequences in mr  nice guy are as spectacular as supercops thrilling helicoptertrain finale or rumble in the bronxs daring leap between two buildings  nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor  respectively  
but the action delivers  even if the energy peters out before the films end  the finale  as spectacular as it is  is a letdown for fans of chans athletic prowess   
filmed almost entirely in english  even so  the voices of some englishspeaking actors are laughably dubbed   mr  nice guy hints at jackie chans latest transition to hollywood productions  he made illfated attempts with s the big brawl and s the protector   next in the pipeline is rush hour  a stateside production costarring chris tucker  
hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown  and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr  nice guy  for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands  much like they have been before
