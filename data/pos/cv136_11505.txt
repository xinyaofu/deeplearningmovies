the premise of wag the dog is so simple that its adequately explained by the commercials  
with  days to go until the election  the president  who we never see  calls in political dirtytricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal  
deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a  pageant   a phony war against albania  fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville  with woody harrelson as the reluctant  psychotic hero  
and if there wasnt anything more to the movie than this  it would be a secondrate heist comedy at best  enlivened by great actors  like sneakers goes to washington  
  a heist comedy  
yup  
deniro and hoffman are  stealing  the election  so to speak  and the movie is more about how they do it  and the fun they have doing it  than anything else   
wag the dog succeeds because its based one great truth  the american people are stupid  
ok  maybe its not  love thy neighbor as thyself  or even  two plus two makes four   but a truth nonetheless  
  any average person who thinks that theyre really smart about the two things this movie satirizes  moviemaking and the political process  is invited  nay  challenged  to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or  hours straight watching cspan when the house is in session   
and because were so utterly  predictably stupid  hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo  washington knows that we wont notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies  and deniros character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we wont be able to locate albania on the map  
the beauty of wag the dog is that it isnt a light  meaningless comedy about politics  like speechless  the michael keaton  geena davis picture  or from the level of lighthearted politcal satire to neargreatness  
nor is it a hardedged cynical look at the manner in which a morallydeprived  ethically challenged babyboomer connives his sleazy way into the white house  like primary colors  and yes  i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out  thanks for asking   
instead  david mamets script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire  
it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers schemes come off beautifully  and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion  
deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables  without any of the violent rages  
its all   what do i love  
what is it that brings me joy  
baseball   minus the savage bloody beating with the bat  
he threatens a lot of people  mind you  but hes doing it in a very nice  polite way  
its a very mellow  restrained performance  which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script  
hoffman  on the other hand  is giddy  exuberant and joyous  
this kind of thing is what his character lives for  and hes so excited that he cant even shut up  
even on the edge of disaster  hes brighteyed  behind oddly tinted sunglasses  and positive  
insiders note that hes basing his character on some powerfulbutanonymous producer  which may or may not be true  but hoffman still exudes the kind of letsputonashow electricity that you figure a producer needs to have  
the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast  
the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them  listen to them talk in that wisedup mamet dialogue  get to know them better  which we dont  
anne heche  is deadbangon in her portrayal of a political press aide  cool and composed on the outside  panicked and frenzied on the outside  
denis leary  one of my favorite actors  see the ref  is the  fad king   who handles the profitable  backend   tshirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative  innovative ways to separate a fool from his money  
they could make a whole movie  just about the fad king  and id go see it  
willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously  from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song  to the weepy country waltz  to the hilarious  ballad of the green berets  parody  
woody harrelson has a brief  but memorable part as the overmedicated  hero  of the albanian conflict  
craig t  nelson  as the opposition candidate  and the everreliable william h  macy  as a wacky cia agent  are given surprisingly short shrift  
  one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing   
wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems  the trivialization of american politics  the role of the press in dumbing down the issues  the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials  the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars  the list goes on  
we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens  
wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we dont
