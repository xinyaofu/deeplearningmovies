the second jackalbased film to come out in   the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal   this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland  and is directed by a man who hailed from joblos own alma matter  concordia university in montreal  canada  
the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal  but does not pretend to be  factual  
plot  naval officer ramirez  quinn  gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal  in order to put an end to the actual militants radical activities  
he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee  
ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this  assignment   and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism  intrigue and doublepersonality syndrome  which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states   
critique  great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to twohour runtime  
admittedly  i wasnt a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film  and didnt expect much from this movie beforehand  but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments  as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line  
the first hour is mostly just a buildup of things to come  and does offer a great characterization of the jackal  but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending  
quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal  but didnt offer anything extraordinary  in my opinion  
sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that theyve played in both of their respective careers of late  but nonetheless  appeared to relish the coldheartedness of their chosen characters  
i didnt like performance put forth from quinns wife in this flick  but then again  she doesnt show up in most of the film  so that wasnt so bad  
i did however enjoy director duguays interesting style and cinematic vision  
this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences  but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer  
i thought that was neat  
having said that  i didnt think the first hour needed to be as long as it was  and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the  fake  jackal met with the  real  jackals girlfriend without much retrospection on her part  but all in all  not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre  
little known facts  ben kingsleys real name is krishna banji  he stands     was born in scarborough  england  and won the best actor honor in s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi  
many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal  canada  joblos haven of restfulness
