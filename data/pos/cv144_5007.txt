the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients  a witty and whimsical script  inspired performances  a great sense of humor  a large and wonderful cast  and the beautiful scenery of vancouver  
its a movie of weddings  marriage  family  infidelity  andoh yeslove  
like  men and a baby  cousins is an americanized version of a french film  s cousin  cousine  
the plot is complicated  but it goes something like this  
larry and tom are cousins  each of whom is notsohappilymarried  
tom starts an affair with larrys wife  tish  and to get even  larry and toms wife  maria  pretend to have an affair of their own  
soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running  
cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures  
the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role  and virtually every performance deserves mention  
ted danson  in his first starring film role  finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity  
while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on  cheers   he is also complex and vulnerable  with more between his ears than empty space  
as maria  isabella rossellini is a joy to watch  she is shy  sensuous  and immensely alluring  
sean young is perfectly cast as larrys picture perfect wife  tish  a superficial and trendy makeup consultant  
keith coogan  from adventures in babysitting  is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larrys rebellious son  mitch  
and finally  lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitchs rambunctious grandfather  he provides some of cousins best lines and laughs  
like moonstruck  cousins is a mix of drama and comedy  
the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd  
it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and hearttug  
how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other  as friends and as lovers  
well  to its credit  cousins is just such a movie  
lets hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins
