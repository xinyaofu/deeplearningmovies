the long and illustrious career of robin williams  which has included both forgettable turns like mrs  
doubtfire and flubber  was punctuated with the actors first academy award in  for his role in good will hunting  
it was his first truly dramatic role since s dead poets society  and critical remarks were unanimously positive  
his next role  that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come  was unfortunately lackluster  
and so  after a sixyear stint as a comedic actor  the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams  
williams is the title character  hunter  patch  adams  sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the cleanshavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting  
were introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies  
its at the institution  however  that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people  
he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginias medical college  where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating  impersonal trade  
his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion  and the movie climaxes with patchs appearance before the state medical board  
the characters are welldefined in an oscarworthy sense  
although the script does not perform well as a narrative  theres little story to be told outside of patchs skitlength experiences  the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters  
at medical school  patch meets up with truman schiff  daniel london   an outsider like himself who relishes patchs zest for humanity  
the two instantly become the best of friends  and its easy to see why  
monica potter plays patchs love interest  a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school  
for some reason hes attracted to her  and although it never gets said  the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view  
the script  based on hunter adams own story  works well this way  
the rest of the cast  bob gunton as the villain professor in particular  is solid  
director tom shadyac  liar liar  leads us in and out of patchs life in a sound  intentional manner  combined with williams presence on screen  the movie rarely becomes boring  
patch adams lack of purpose is its major shortcoming  and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours  theres little feeling of continuity or the passage of time  
nevertheless  its an emotionally moving picture  and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season  
it succeeds at everything it tries  and only fails at the stuff it doesnt try in the first place  
by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams  but more importantly  its entertainment for the entire family
