capsule  a rock and roll fable  indeed  
like a hubert selby  jr  novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen  and a ton of fun  
streets of fire bills itself as  a rock and roll fable   and the description is perfect  
this is a stylish  greatlooking  and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby  jr   novel with a damon runyan rewrite  irected by bruce springsteen  
noir is one of the few truly american movie genres  aside from the hollywood musical and the western  
this is postwwii brooklyn noir  for lack of a better label  with a generous injection of rock n roll and an allaround confrontational attitude  
it all works  
the plot is simplicity itself  rocker ellen aim  diane lane  is kidnapped by a vicious street gang  led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven  willem dafoe  very nasty   
her old soldier flame  played by michael pare  comes back into town to save her  but doesnt count on a whole bunch of things going askew  
thats about the entire plot  save for the spats with ellens manager  a hilarious rick moranis   an encounter with a doowop group that winds up becoming ellens supporting act  and a whole gang of other fun little touches  
but in movies like this  when is the plot important  
the movie is all style  all visuals and attitudes  quotable lines and posturing  and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing  
no surprise that it was directed by walter hill   hrs    who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly  and has put together a movie thats a mixture of times and sensibilities  but perfectly unified in tone  
when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie  especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw   and  passes out  every    minutes on cue  
streets of fire isnt the greatest movie ever made  but it occupies a totally unique little niche  and enjoys the position it has  
anyone with a weakness for doowop  neon  motorcycles  rainy streets  the el  studebakers  gang pictures  lonely heroes  and a greatlooking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up  
i did
