with his last two films  shine and snow falling on cedars  australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there  and his latest  hearts in atlantis  is no different  
its structure  beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle  is similar to the green mile  which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books  
the parallels dont end there  either  
atlantis was adapted by william goldman  who had previously penned the bigscreen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for kings dreamcatcher  
even the films content is a bit reminiscent of mile  
in fact  its the perfect blend of the feelgood s nostalgia of stand by me  also by king  and mystical power hokum of mile  
kings atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories  but the main focus here is on the first  and longest  tale  called low men in yellow coats  the films title comes from the second chapter   
its set in  harwich  connecticut  where yearold bobby garfield  anton yelchin  lives in a boarding house run by his cold  selfcentered mother elizabeth  hope davis  joe goulds secret   who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son  
bobby spends his time with his two closest friends  john sullivan  will rothhaar  and tomboy carol gerber  mika boorem   who become something like the kevin  paul and winnie of harwich  
when a new tenant moves into the vacant room  the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan  anthony hopkins  hannibal   a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobbys mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror  
ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature  after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday   dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men  a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers  
i wont go into what these powers are  but theyre considerably toned down from the book  and dont involve black stuff flying out of teds mouth  a la mile   
atlantis presentday setting which bookends the film is based on the novels final chapter  titled heavenly shades of night are falling  and features david morse  in yet another connection to the green mile  as a married  middleaged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years  
atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks cedars  which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski  the oscarnominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowskis red  
the acting is solid from everyone  including hopkins  who never once makes you think of dr  lecter  
most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem  who both had tiny parts in along came a spider  
while i didnt really have much of a problem with goldmans screenplay  i do need to point out at least one inconsistency  
goldman  for those of you who dont read premiere  writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody elses films  carefully explaining why they all suck  make no sense and insult their audiences  while somehow failing to mention the crap that hes penned  like the generals daughter   
its meanspirited but fun to read  mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business  including michael jackson  o  j  
and robert blake   
in atlantis  which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby  one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back  
well  hes not  and it doesnt make sense  
    pg for violence and thematic elements
