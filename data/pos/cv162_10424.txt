be forewarned  
on december     amidst all the yearend oscar bait releases from the major studios  miramaxs genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  
although the teen horror market had been given up for allbutdead in recent years  the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns  eventually topping  million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history  while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry  suddenly  everybody was looking for hip  inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  
scream director wes craven  previously best known as the creator of new lines a nightmare on elm street film series  was thrust back into the limelight  
and screams rookie scribe  kevin williamson  burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  
its hard to understate this last point  
mr  williamson has  based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing  scream  i know what you did last summer from october   and now scream    enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame  quickly become the most wellknown screenwriter amongst the entertainment weeklyreading  box office figurewatching youth culture since  well  since that quentin tarantino guy  whom  it is said  has also achieved some renown as a director   
indeed  in a singularly freakish oddity  it is the screenwriter  mr  williamson  and not the director that has been receiving the lions share of acclaim for the success of scream  and the print advertisements for scream s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence  while the traditional  a film by wes craven  drapes the films title in the ads  right below it  in equal sized font  yet  reads  written by kevin williamson   an affirmation of the screenwriters contribution to the project which may be unprecedented  
  i can envision the board of wga  licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of  a film by  is attained   
and  much like mr  tarantinos screenwriting  mr  williamsons work is vaguely unconventional  incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  
in scream  they satirically discussed other horror films  here in the sequel  the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  
scream was written in  during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood  and mr  williamsons rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel  
while the sequel was planned from the outset  a treatment of scream  was included when mr  williamson sold the screenplay for scream  the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived  and its only at about the films midway point when it becomes engaging  
like its predecessor  scream  opens with a splashy  eyegrabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the films principal narrative  this time around  were following the exploits of a young couple  jada pinkett and omar epps  attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab  a running filmwithinafilm gag where the  true life  events behind the first film has been turned into a movie   
however  although it tries hard and has some good ideas  the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with  and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overlynoisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes  the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore  where her performance not only convinced me that she  could  act  but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that ive ever seen   
there are too many knowing  hip popculture references crammed into the scream  sequence  and the setup isnt nearly as cleverly frightening as screams  while the first films preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying  the payoff here is almost campily theatrical  
flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college  where returning characters sidney  neve campbell  and randy  jamie kennedy  have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film  
the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors  singleminded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers  courteney cox  roars into town to cover the breaking story  while everawkward former deputy dewey riley  david arquette  flies in to protectively guard over sidney  
theyre joined by cotton weary  liev schreiber   who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film  his role here is significantly expanded  
the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory  although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isnt necessary  not because so many people have seen the first installment  but because this is  after all  a sequel to a slasher film  what do you  think  happened to these characters in the prior movie  
theres a lot of new faces on the scene too  sidneys new boyfriend  derek  jerry oconnell  and her new roommate hallie  elise neal   randys fellow film student mickey  timothy olyphant   gales newlyassigned nervous cameraman joel  duane martin   omnipresent local journalist debbie salt  laurie metcalf   coed cici cooper  ms  buffy herself  sarah michelle gellar   and a pair of simpering sorority sisters  rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi   
any of these characters could be the killer  or for that matter  could be the next victim  
as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay  the narrative is once again framed around the increasinglyflimsy premise of a whodunit  
one problem that scream didnt have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer  
here  and to some extent in i know what you did last summer   mr  williamsons screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery  
the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements  
  it doesnt help matters any that the killers alterego is fairly obvious from the getgo   
indeed  the finale plays as fullout camp when the villain is finally unmasked  frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes  
this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations  scheming  and motivation  that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it  
while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived  the aspect where its headandshoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences  
theyre staged much more imaginatively here  save for the first postprologue murder  which is handled in such a mediocre  conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable s slasher flicks that the first film satirized   and are much more fun to watch  
its hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck  and a catandmouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged  although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown  
in terms of its characters  the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey  who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music   
their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour  an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is wellwritten  and theres a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed  
on the other hand  sidney is pretty dull here  
she doesnt have any compelling presence  and theres nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that shes the returning heroine  
given this  and the fact that theres no strong second banana character for sidney  elise neals role isnt nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowans shoes   its no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film  
what surprises me the most about scream  is its zealousness in decimating its cast  
the films mounting body count bears out the fact that  no  character is safe  well   almost    while in principal i applaud this bold policy  at some point youve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel  
  i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular  whose casting for the next installment of the series wouldve seemed obvious   
but hey  as rose mcgowans character said in the first film   no  please dont kill me  mr  ghostface  i want to be in the sequel   
look what that got her
