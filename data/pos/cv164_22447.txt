this christmas  little ralphie parker  peter billingsley  wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree  
although cautioned by many that he will  shoot his eye out  ralphie remains optimistic  conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers  
it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun  and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one  
a christmas story is a favorite among many during the holiday season  and boy  it is certainly easy to see why  
ralphies endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood  when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable  
evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things a christmas story does so well  
here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season  
  period detail  
this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard  who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the s with loving detail  
shepard narrates from a first person pointofview  divulging his various adventures one snowy december  in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head  
shepards firsthand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious  but also witty and warm  with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing  
on top of that  young billingsleys stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration  
director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality  
i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like  
  mom and dad  
both melinda dillon  as mom  and darren mcgavin  as  the old man  are perfect in their roles  
its hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one  with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured  
for instance  he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound  and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues  
in portraying the writer as a persistent but mildmannered young lad  peter billingsley has struck quite the chord  
his performance is richly textured  making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment  
which brings us to     
  the comic situations  
there are plenty of memorable moments in a christmas story  
moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing  with so much more to explore and to cherish  
i am particularly partial of the  fword scene  in which ralphie blurts out the shocking fourletter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard  
again  shepards method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry  
the numerous sequences that stick in ones mind include  of course  the famous department store santa scene  in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree  
i could go on  but ill finish on this note  a christmas story is a standout among holiday movies  because it captures so much in a meager  minutes  
not only is it funny  its often genuinely hilarious     not to mention warm  fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places  
i plan on making a christmas story a christmas tradition  
why dont you
