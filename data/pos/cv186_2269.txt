ive never been a member of the robin williams fan club  
a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way  and i sometimes feel as though im watching a yearold class clown  
in his films  williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchyfeely emotion  leading to wildly uneven performances  
mrs  
doubtfire seemed readymade for the same problems  but instead it proves to be williams best comic screen project yet  
while it still contains some characteristic selfindulgence  mrs  
doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging bellylaugh comedy served up with high energy  
williams stars as daniel hillard  a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior  
one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda  sally field   and she files for a divorce  
unemployed  living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children  daniel decides to respond to mirandas ad for an afternoon housekeeper  
he turns to his brother frank  harvey fierstein   a theatrical makeup artist  and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire  a matronly yearold englishwoman  
daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on mirandas flirtation with a wealthy client  pierce brosnan   to spend time with the children  and to learn something about responsible parenting  all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best  
mrs  doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work  and basically it does so  
the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel  and thanks to the fantastic special makeup thats instantly believable  
it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film  making dustin hoffmans dorothy michaels look like milton berle  
more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell  its a bit hard to swallow that she doesnt recognize any of the voices as her husbands  
perhaps the biggest contrivance were asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs  doubtfire in a few minutes  
theres more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask  
fortunately  these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll  
during the film  i was generally too busy laughing  
after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams riffing  mrs  
doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place  
daniels frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful  as is the climactic restaurant sequence  even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away  
clearly  most of the credit for doubtfires success goes to robin williams  
it took putting him in drag  but for once he plays a comic character that isnt just robin williams with a different name  
he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire  and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foulmouthed  
wisely  he never aims for saintly  
his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty  but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity  
its one of mrs  
doubtfires charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect  just people trying to be better  
as miranda  sally field is solid in a background role  and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu  
the children are also good  although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest  
the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing  
its easy to see mrs  
doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over  and its true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common  
but mrs  
doubtfire manages to carve out its own space  particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judges decision and the ultimate status of daniel and mirandas relationship  
theres nothing dazzlingly new in mrs  
doubtfire  but there are plenty of laughs  and good comedies are always in short supply  
and its nice to see robin williams just act for a change
