weir is wellrespected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subjectmatter into deceptively simple  powerful films  the mosquito coast  utopia  and fearless  posttraumatic stress disorder  among them  
in the truman show  weir essentially breathes life into the nowtired concept of mediamanipulation by tackling the material from the insideout  
it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in topform playing the title character  truman burbank  
by now you must be aware of the premise  unbeknownst to him  truman  carrey  is the star of his own tv series  a  peepshow in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations  people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants  
seahaven  his hometown  and the show itself  are the brainchild of christof  harris   who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon  directing over  cameras and hundreds of actors and extras  
for  years  truman suspects nothingwe accept the reality were given   poses christofbut a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in fiji  mcelhone  who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement  overwhelms him  
thus  christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact  lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highlyrated program  
in a few broad strokes  weir creates a convincing secondreality  and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost threequarters through  
this allows us to comprehend and accept trumans world before we contextualize it  
for all his madness  christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship  and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it  
truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be  well  so darn nice  like a sibling  or  perhaps more appropriately  a caged animal in an interactive zoo   they want to see him succeed  
the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carreyhe really is an everyman here  abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible  wideeyed bewilderment  
cinematically  the truman show is impeccable  stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images  
as well  it employs wojciech kilars piece  zycie za zycie masterfully and beautifully  
if the film has any flaws  one may find them in laura linneys characterization as meryl  trumans  wife   i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone   and in a subplot involving trumans father  which feels curiously incomplete  
there are a few stupendous sequences  and the film pulls off a wonderful trick  we become trumans audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film  
they wear buttons asking how will it end   
i couldnt wait to know myself  though i didnt exactly want it to end  for this inspired movie is possibly the bestand most complexsummer picture in years
