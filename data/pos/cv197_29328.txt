damn those trailers  
had it not been for the advertising of this film  which reveals far too much about its contents  i would have been glued to under the sand  
as it is  the film retains some value  thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling  and a more mature francois ozon in the directors chair  
marie  charlotte rampling  and her husband jean  bruno cremer  lounge on the beach  
she takes a nap while he goes for a swim  
when marie wakes up  jean is nowhere to be found  
she contacts authorities  but they cant find him either  
did he disappear to start a new life  
was he killed by accident  
did he commit suicide  
marie still asks herself these questions a year later  and in order to move on with her life  she must find some answers  
its a fine premise  and this little movie uses it to the limit  
the film moves at a leisurely pace  a bit slow  but relaxing  
its a very visual story  and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles  
this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie  who shot the film in a dreamy haze  and the lead performance by rampling  
rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie  you connect with her character instantly  despite that shes delusional  
the scenes where she interacts with her husband  who she still believes is alive  are heartbreaking  
she cant quite get over him  
theyve been married for twentyfive years  
the other actors  particularly jacques nolot  are excellent too  
the sex in the film is rather unneeded  but compared to ozons criminal lovers  its the disney channel  
likely to cause some discussion afterwards  under the sand is a fine movie going experience  
while its hard to recommend as entertainment  its a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss  
ozon seems to ask what you would do  and thats certainly a hard question to answer
