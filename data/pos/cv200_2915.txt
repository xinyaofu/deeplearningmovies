a common complaint amongst film critics is  why arent there more literate scripts available   
quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isnt dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content  
paul attanasios script takes what could have been a tepid thriller  the quiz show scandals of the late s  and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors  
the film is riddled with telling symbols  e  g  
a  chrysler  a radio announcement of sputnik  but is never heavy handed  
deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes  john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script  
redford departs from the usually overlight   cable tv quality  sets and camera work so common in recent th century period pieces  
quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years  
although i was only  years old when the  twenty one  scandal broke  enough of the s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redfords almost tangible palette  
from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants  the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism  of a generation that had gone through  years of depression and world war without  disposable income   before the manifestation of its american dream  
the film deftly weaves several themes together  from assimilation and exclusion of jews from  the good life   to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his fathers fame  
though the s audience that is  rocked  by this scandal may initially seem naive to us  they should appear all too familiar  with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding  
charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day  
the tv audience is almost a fourth main character  always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf  
at the films end  the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same s tv audience  mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff  
like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret  this  mirror  may reflect an image were not all that comfortable with
