whew  this film oozes energy  the kind of breakneck  no holdsbarred  inyourface risktaking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days  
like the marginal  motley bunch of postapocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict  trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control  
the result  a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message  
the message  a bunch of losers with loser names  mark renton  ewan mcgregor   spud  ewan bremner   sick boy  jonny lee miller   tommy  kevin mckidd   and begbie  robert carlyle   
bored  aimless and restless  their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub  grooving to techno or glamrock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods  some ingenious  others plainly dumb and desperate  
not part of the daily dose if obtained  sex is a bonus  
you can find these characters as they are  foulmouthed  dirty  pathetic  ugly perhaps but definitely interesting  in irvin welshs cult novel of the same name  
what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message  
one of the first things youll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly  
itll truck into a characters pimple  just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot  
distracted and curious  itll maintain a characters eyelevel or drop right to the ground to show the dopedouteyeview  
youll even find characters peering into the camera  their faces smeared across the wideangle lens  
this film camera is just another one of the guys  
tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality  boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across  
bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares  
i dont want to give too much away  but if you cross chuckie from childs play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures  you might have an idea just how fun or pantswetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be  
that said  this film has a good share of drugs  consumed  vomitted  defecated  pissed off  exchanged  bought  sold  injected  smuggled  enjoyed and regretted  
if that isnt your cup of tea  nobody forced you to see the film  
stay at home and rent up close and personal  
and whats a buzz without tunes  
from pulp to iggy pop  yes  hes still alive   the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film  
good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message  
every once in a while  a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict  
trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations
