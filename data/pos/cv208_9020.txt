i hate to burst your bubble  but after all the star power  mega bucks  screenwriters  directors  and cool trailers  men in black is not the best movie of the summer  
its pretty good in its own right  yes  but i would probably split the  best movie  honors among faceoff  spawn  con air  and maybe event horizon  
its main problem is that its quickly forgettable  and i cant remember one truly good scene from it  
from con air  it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt  
in spawn  it was the  living room hell  conclusion at the end  
in event horizon  it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hells forces  
and all of faceoff was pretty dang good  
but as for men in black  the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches  
i remember it not for its humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted  
and yes  i did see mimic  which is something ill touch on in a later review  
back to men in black  is it just me  or does that sound funny   
i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the th grade and read magazines like wizard  etc   for those of you who arent comicgeeks  wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars  what the new yorker is to high society  what boys life is to boy scots  
okay  that one was pretty pathetic   
few people know this  but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was  while not honestpoliticianrare  very hard to find  
this was after the release of the highgrossing batman forever  and it said that tommy lee jones and chris odonnell were being considered for the roles  in the comic book  there were no black men in black  
kind of weird  huh   
all i can say is  thank god they didnt cast chris odonnell  
i know i cant be the only person on the planet who thinks hes an annoying  preppie little snot    
sorry  
my apologies to odonnell fans  
i actually had a th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him  anticipating rather craftily that  if the movie was a big hit  it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely  
he decided not to sell them to me  because they were  innappropriate   
hmm     
so now youre probably wondering why ive wasted about  paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years  
good question  
ill move on to the movie now  
as you probably already know  will smith and tommy lee jones  agents k and j  respectively  belong to a top secret agency known as divison   or its nickname mib  men in black   
men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear  and theyre mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while theyre here on earth  
not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the  people in the world who havent seen this movie  but a basicallybigroachtypebug lands in a redneck farmers yard  inhabits his body  and attempts to destroy the entire universe  
not bad  eh   i have no idea why i just typed that  
im not even really paying attention anymore   
the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black  
i found their main headquarters to be boring  as were the  cool weapons  they had  
the noisy cricket just plain sucked  no matter what anyone said  
and the movie definitely surprised me in tone  although it probably shoudlnt have  
its director  barry sonnenfield  is known for  black humor   directing both addams family movies  
this movie was basically a  black comedy   not an actionscifi like i expected from the trailers  
dont get me wrong on what i think of this movie  
its not bad  i gave it     
it was mostly entertaining throughout its run  and had a very good ending  although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it  
my diagnosis for this picture  a good weekend rental  but not worth a movie ticket  
of course  the movie is now long gone from theaters  but thats beside the point  
i think
