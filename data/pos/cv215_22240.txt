  when will the devil take me   he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over  
the spoiled title character of onegin  pronounced ohneggin  is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour  
martha fiennes debut feature is  quite literally  filmed poetry  its based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin   a profound study of regret  of how we confuse shame with guilt  
when we first meet eugene onegin  ralph  acting for his sister  another brother  magnus  composed the score   a philandering aristocrat from st  petersburg  he has just inherited his uncles estate  
with plans to sell it  onegin pays a summer visit to the manor  which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside  and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods  
smitten with olga larina  headey   he befriends olgas fianc   vladimir lensky  stephens   while olgas sister  tatyana  tyler   romanticizing his flippant attitude  hes a nineteenth bad boy   falls for onegin  
in one sweaty  inky torrent of passion  tatyana writes him a love letter  
he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections  it is implied  because he can  
soon after  tragedy strikes  and onegin makes himself scarce  
when we catch up with him  six years later  he has just returned to st  petersburg  where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend  donovan  has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana  
this time  onegin finds her irresistable  
what is most amazing about ralph fiennes performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch  
overwhelmed by a top hat  the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off  an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past  
the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long nowtheres room to breathe in a role thats made up of shades of gray like  onegin   
petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in  parking lot    you dont know what youve got  til its gone   
onegins aboutface on tatyana speaks for those of us  read  most of us  who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well  
what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse  embarrassment  even  at having let her go  
out of identification we feel empathy for onegin  a callous bastard  
tatyanas emotions echo a thousand ditties  but that makes them no less vital  
she changes  too  from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties  
tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk costars  filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares  
they both have faces  mr  fiennes and ms  tyler  capable of conveying archetypal russian misery  
onegin could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of  masterpiece theater   even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact  were martha fiennes not at the helm  
an mtv background  she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others  has positively influenced her sense of pace  though  thankfully  not her shot lengthsno spasmodic cutting here   at just over  minutes  onegin clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair  
the film has an atypical period look  as well  
absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions  
the sets are almost expressionistically bare  echoing the loneliness of the protagonists  
  cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them  im reminded the climax  which unfolds in a sea of white   
martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema  and her spare  often painfully human visual presentation of  yevgeny onegin  is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkins difficult text yet  
ms  fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion
