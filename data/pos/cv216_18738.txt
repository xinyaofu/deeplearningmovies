bruce barths mellow piano plays in the background as conflict erupts in a little country town of florida  
ulees gold feels like another fonda creation on golden pond  it has a soft  calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath  the cinematography creates a place of gold  yellow  and olive colors  the music is stirring and tranquil  
both deal with the hardships of family life  
peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu  ezs new film and patricia richardson  home improvement star  shows she is worthy of big screen attention  
nu  ez is probably independent films greatest asset  along with john sayles  and he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating  heavy tension  
peter fondas performance borrows from his father henry fondas in on golden pond there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father  peter fonda is quiet  emotional  and weary in this exceptional role  
ulee jackson  the films protagonist  is struggling  
pressure is mounting at the wrong time  
he is a beekeeper and this is his  busy  season  
he has to deal with his two granddaughters needs and erupting hormones  he is forced to pick up his daughterinlaw in orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care of her  and he is faced with a challenging task  unsettled business his son  who is now in prison  has left behind  
he finds his daughterinlaw  helen  with the two men his son robbed a bank with  
she has apparently told these two men that the money that resulted from the robbery is with her husband  
that is why he got caught the police found him with the money  
now the two men are demanding they get the cash  or they will come after ulees two granddaughters  
ulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a deranged helen back to his serene little home where her two children that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt  
ulee is a man who lost his pals in war he was the only man in his platoon to survive  
he refuses help from anybody and does not respond to affectionate gestures  
he is a bitter  closedoff man whose only passion is his beekeeping  his granddaughters  and his dead wife  
connie  his next door neighbor  finally gets through to him with friendly favors  
she is a nurse and helps helen get through her turmoil with drugs  
ulees gold is the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is until the truth is revealed painfully to him  he is cold and unfeeling  
of course  in the end  ulee softens up  but his journey is absorbing and we have fallen in love with his tiredness and weariness  
what is admirable about the movie is peter fondas winning turn as ulee and the story that feels like nobodys fool but  in the end  ends up in a class of its own
