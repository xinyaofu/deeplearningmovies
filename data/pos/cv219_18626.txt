it must be tough to be a mob boss  
just ask paul vitti  robert deniro   a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing  
i can believe it  too  one cant even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when hes forced to choose between an ice pick  baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with  
suffering from reoccurring panic attacks  paul decides he needs to consult some professional help  
and who better than billy crystal  
after appearing in bottomofthebarrel flops  fathers day and my giant  crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here  
playing vittis private shrink  the two very different stars strike an unorthodox  but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish  
casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an injoke  i think  
placed in this mobsters shoes  deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather  part ii and casino  
its obvious hes having a lot of fun doing so  
the man behind the camera is harold ramis  whose credits include ghostbusters  as writer and star   and his best directing effort  the bill murray vehicle  groundhog day  
ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows whats funny  and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors  
the only character who weakens the payoff is crystals bridetobe  lisa kudrow   
playing the same dumbeddown role as she does in friends  kudrow is amusing  but doesnt fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped  
the supporting cast sparkles  
joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly  vittis pea brained righthand man  and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster whos in desperate need of the definition of closure  
the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout  putting the emphasis on  or  really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides  
the situation is just too cute to resist  
its unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand  
but hey  if youre in the mafia  using obscenities probably comes naturally  
and near the end  seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat
