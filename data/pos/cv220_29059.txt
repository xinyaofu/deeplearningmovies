a strange mixture of shine  basquiat  angel heart  and grant morrison  dave mckeans graphic novel  arkham asylum   the cavemans valentine is a feverish tale of a homeless madmancumdetective who  on the morning of february th  discovers a  valentine  just outside his new york cave  one of ella fitzgeralds strange fruit  stuck in the crotch of a treea young male model murdered and frozen to a branch  
believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant  shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building  is responsible for the murder  romulus  samuel l  jackson  is put on the trail of an avantgarde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould  david leppenraub  colm feore   
his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation  romulus was a brilliant julliardtrained pianist prior to his psychosis   romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his policewoman daughter  aunjanue ellis  that even though hes a nut  that doesnt mean that he cant solve a highprofile society murder  
every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas  and every character the same  the cavemans valentine is a concept so  high concept  that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment  with romuluss  caveman  a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlanes urban noir hero  spawn  
with a longvanished wife  tamara tunie  acting as a spiritual guide  the occasional social caste commentary  the secret base in a cave  a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters  and a wickedly colourful archenemy  the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars werent inscribed with  gotham pd   
that being said  the cavemans valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy  a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart  
the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when  in fact  the cavemans valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless  again like mcfarlanes spawn  while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts  
it is no small detail that our hero  romulus  is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life  in legend  without knowledge of his royal birth  but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park  in the romulus mythology  signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures  while in the film  the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds  but of the carrion itself  
whether or not romulus of the cavemans valentine will found a nation  or  in the case of novelist george dawes green  upon whose novel his own screenplay is based  a franchise  the fact remains that the cavemans valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of  thus far  
it  along with m  night shyamalans unbreakable  is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has  since millers seminal  the dark knight returns   redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics  
readers of sam keiths brilliant  the maxx  comic series  or of mtvs shortlived animated adaptation of the same  are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne  
the failure of both  the maxx  tv show and of the cavemans valentine  not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable  suggests that the public may not be ready for americas surprising contributions to dark fantasy  
luxuriantly lit  brashly saturated  and comicpanel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent  death in venice  ca   while inhabiting robin standefers  practical magic  mesmerizing sets  the cavemans valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film  
kasi lemmons  following up her brilliant  debut  eves bayou  which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism  fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys  artists and suffering  
the cavemans valentine is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape  
clearly not for every taste  when approached with the correct paradigm  it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year  a redefinition of the hero archetype for a postmodern audience with urinestained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes  
the cavemans valentine is a fine and a courageous film  crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliots rats alley wasteland
