if you want some hearty laughs  then rat race is the movie for you  
this unpretentious little comedy  which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype  will have you bouncing in your theater seat  
and while the film fits neatly into the lowbrow  slapstick school of comedy  one refreshing aspect is its lack of meanspiritedness  
the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner  john cleese  who must race from vegas to a bus station locker  miles away in silver city  n  m  
inside the locker is a duffel bag containing  million  
the first one to open the locker  gets the bag and the money  
what the group of participants doesnt know is that cleeses donald sinclair   i can do anything i want  im eccentric    is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel  
the participants include vera  whoopi goldberg  and merrill  lanai chapman   a newly reunited mother and daughter  disgraced pro football referee owen templeton  cuba gooding jr    italian tourist mr  pollini  rowan atkinson   randy pear  jon lovitz  and his family  the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody  seth green and vince vieluf   and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer  breckin meyer   
various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city  
screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another  
the most sidesplitting situations involve vera and merrills encounter with the squirrel lady  a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates  owens commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball lookalikes on their way to a lucy convention  the cody brothers misadventures with a hotair balloon  a flying cow and a monster truck  and the pear familys stopover at a barbie museum  which turns out not to be what they think it is  
the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckmans script builds the laughs  
without going into detail  this bit segues from the museum to hitlers touring car  to eva brauns dark lipstick  to lovitz burning his tongue  culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans  
rat races cast is first rate  
cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap  lovitz is  at first  a bit whiny  but his character grows on you  gooding is having a fine romp  and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleeses deadpan assistant  a man  born without a personality   
the film is directed by jerry zucker  who knows something about comedy  
along with his brother  david  and friend jim abrahams  he was responsible for such hits as airplane  
and ruthless people  
a throwaway subplot  which is good for some laughs  features cleese and his buddies  betting on a series of outlandish situations  including one dealing with a hooker and peptobismol  
this is a fun little feature  
the only letdown comes at the finale  which is too touchyfeely and sweet  almost negating what came before it  
rat race is a summer sleeper  but it will keep you awake  as will the laughter of those watching around you
