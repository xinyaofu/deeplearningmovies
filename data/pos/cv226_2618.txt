i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night  
i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success  personal growth and insightful humor about life  
i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard  getting some of the latter and not much of the former  
the basic plot revolves around billy crystal  who plays mitch robbins  turning forty  
hes now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original  
hes given a job at the radio station to his best friend  played by daniel stern  out of sympathy while sterns character works through his divorce  
his loser younger brother  john lovitz  comes to mitchs house to bum a money and place to live  all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday  
during the celebration  mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curlys  the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance  old hat  
after a business trip to las vegas  crystal  stern  and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure  
on the way  they run into curlys twin brother  duke  played by  you know who  jack palance  
first of all  the cinematography was beautifully done  especially the outdoor scenes in the desert  
the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself  
there is some character development during the film  
the actors remain true to their characters and play them well  without overplaying the jokes  
the movie is a good basic adventure  with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict  
the movie is paced well  but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end  
humorwise  the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film  
there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake  but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel  surprise  surprise for a sequel  right    
however  the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the films manipulation of the audience  
the film tries to pull your heartstrings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other  like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friends butt  
this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original  
there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic  like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didnt worry more about water while tromping around the desert  
some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here  
since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich  unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original   i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey  
overall  id say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some storyline deficiencies making it less worthy than the original  
it may be worth the full price of admission  but a matinee would be a better bargain
