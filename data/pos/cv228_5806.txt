we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist  
years later we see his subsequent resurfacing  in the mid s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world  
the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown  
based on the life story of david helfgott  this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a childgenius  compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father  
in the s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy  
the film traces his relationship with his father  whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys  
david is offered places in the usa  but his father refuses to let him leave australia  
the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot  david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teachers house  
he is well lit via the external house lights  
his teacher isnt home  
we pull back and see that the dark front rooms window has its curtains open  
there  in a pool of blackness  is a grand piano  
davids fall over the dark cliff has begun  
instead of being told in a linear mode  shine jumps around in time  ala  pulp fiction   
this narrative device works well  we see david as a boy  teenager in london and mentalpatient in various snippets  
the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion  
adulthelfgotts return to the light is told in linear fashion  
the lead role is played by  different actors  with the teenagedavid  taylor  and adultdavid  rush  standing out  
whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia  i think this is his first major cinema work  
his david  whilst clearly damaged  he keeps quoting his  daddy  in a babbling word torrent  cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts  is both touching and funny  
taylors teenagedavid is the more sympathy producing role  
we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building  
his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninovs rd  whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart  
technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production  
i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects  
one scene has adulthelfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain  
the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice  
with a clever subtlety  the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping  but of the same beat  
the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd  
but its us being clapped  
we are youngdavid walking up to the stage for our first public show  
the music  as you would expect from a film of this subject matter  is critical  
and it works very well  
the miming of the actors piano playing is faultless  apparently rush didnt mime  he really did play  
helfgotts life is certainly not without its sympathetic people  
indeed his return to the normal world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women  
his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft  
it shows that with the help of god we can all find our way back home
