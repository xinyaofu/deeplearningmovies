well  ill admit when i first heard about this film  which was before dantes peak  i could just smell what twister had started  
so now it seems that were in a full fledged return to the s disaster film era  
with twister  dantes peak  volcano and soon flood and james camerons extremly expensive titanic 
ill say first off i enjoyed volcano much more than i did dantes peak  
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in  
ive been reading a lot about the movie being cheezy or hokey and really didnt see or think that once during the entire film  
i get bored easily and this film didnt bore me for a minute  
another thing  and boy am i bitching today   that bothers me is when critics and such go on about  well thats not really possible   
you know what  
i couldnt give a bloody damn if its possible or not  really i couldnt  
its a freaking movie and i dont want reality thrown in my face  
i want to be able to see the impossible  the all might  what if  to many reviewers have seen one to many movies  
the special effects are the second star to this feature  
they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground  
they did an incredible job and come oscar time  if they remember  some notice better be thrown there way
