note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction  the cinematic output from its creator  quentin tarantino  has been surprisingly low  
oh  hes been busy  doing the talk show circuit  taking small roles in various films  overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn  making cameo appearances on television shows  providing a vignette for the illfated anthology four rooms  everything  it seems  except direct another featurelength film  
its been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr  tarantinos new feature film  jackie brown  one of the most anticipated films of the year  and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the s  
things arent going well for jackie brown  pam grier   
shes  years old  stuck at a deadend job      a year  plus retirement benefits that arent worth a damn   as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america  and shes just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette  portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton  and police officer mark dargus  michael bowen  smuggling   from mexico for gunrunner ordell robbie  samuel l  jackson   who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry  robert forster   
the loquacious ordell  based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny  bonghitting surfer girl melanie  bridget fonda  and agreeable crony louis gara  robert de niro  hang out  operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat  and hes soon out to silence jackie brown  
meanwhile  the authorities target is ordell  and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a halfmillion dollars  
only through a series of clever twists  turns  and doublecrosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses  
although jackie brown marks mr  tarantinos first produced screenplay adaptation  based on the elmore leonard novel  rum punch    theres no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film  
while hes adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense  the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead characters now black  
in terms of ambiance  the film harkens back to the s  from the walltowall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets  even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage s productions  
the opening sequence featuring ms  grier wordlessly striding through the lax  funky music blaring away on the speakers  is emblematic of films of that era  
the timeframe for the film is in fact   but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro  
of course  nothing in the film screams s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads  and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists  backstabbing  and deceptions deliciously unfold  the strength of jackie brown is the quiet  understated relationship developed between jackie and max  when they kiss  its perhaps the most tender scene of the year  
tenderness  in a quentin tarantino film  
sure  thereve been moments of sweetness in his prior films  the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer  or even in reservoir dogs  where a deep  unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters  but for the most part  mr  tarantinos films are typified by manic energy  unexpected outbursts of violence  and clever  often wordy  banter  
these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown  but whats new here is a different facet of his storytelling  a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent  and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation  
this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr  tarantino as simply a helmer of slick  hip crime dramas with fasttalking lowlifes  and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent  hes the real deal  
this new aspect of mr  tarantinos storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character  that of the worldweary  sensitive  and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry  whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching  
mr  forsters nuanced  understated performance is the best in the film  he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie  we smile along with him  
much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead  with the wags buzzing that mr  tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travoltas thensagging career  
as it turns out  ms  grier is solid in the films title role  although nothing here forces her to test her range  
i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection  though  shes been working steadily over the years  often in directtovideo action flicks  but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burtons mars attacks  
and larry cohens original gangstas  where she first teamed up with mr  forster   
of course  its true that her role here was a godsend  a meaty a part as this is rarity for  any  actress  let alone one of her age and current status in the industry  
while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone  it marks tremendous growth of mr  tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding  and whose characterizations have never been better  
and while the films narrative doesnt really warrant a running time of  minutes  its filled with such sumptuous riches  ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining  inconsequential conversations between the characters  that there wasnt an unengaging moment  
with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt  itll be interesting to see what he tries next
