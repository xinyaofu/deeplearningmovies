frank capras film is a centenial classic  watched and reexperienced by every generation  
wonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh  maybe fresher  then it did when it was first released  
many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly  
but this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with firstrate acting  wit and suspense  glorious music  and terrific set peices  
the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence  georges guardian angel  
they arent all that bad  but they remain corny and a little out of place  
nevertheless  this is one film that deserves its place in time  cinema history  and our hearts  
it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age  
here is one genuine masterpeice  a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection  
this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny  exciting  moving and uplifting  
the film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey  there isnt too much to it  but capra and the gang  various screenwriters  composers  actors  plumet the material to its fullest potential  
the result is a film  though not at first intended to be pigeonholed as a holiday film  that will always be remembered  celebrated  and loved
