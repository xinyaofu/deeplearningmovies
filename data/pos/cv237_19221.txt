the happy bastards second review 
big daddy 
happy gilmore as a father  
of course  
thats the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy  a movie thats passable but isnt really considered some of sandlers best work  
he doesnt actually play happy gilmore in the movie  but a variation of him  
hes sonny coufax  a man whos living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his onedayaweek gig as a tollbooth man  tollbooth willie    
his girlfriend  kristy swanson  is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him  
enter a year old kid  whos mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate  jon stewart   whos off in china on a business trip  
from there  coufax basically acts as the kids father  teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks  
he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker  joey lauren adams   but  somehow  he also garners the attention of social services  who arent particularly pleased with coufaxs actions  as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid  
the reason i say its not really sandlers best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie  showing some odd feelings that somehow didnt really belong in a sandler vehicle  
i mean  it fits the movies tone and everything  and sandler handles it well  but its just oddly placed  thats all  
fortunately  it doesnt destroy the goofy glee path its been following and it still makes you feel good  
sandler does a good job here  as he does in most of his movies  
rob schneider  however  is irritating as his friend  an immigrant delivery boy who cant read  
stewart  in his minor time on screen  is great  and adams remains a joy to watch  
look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum  
hes a hoot  
directed by dennis dugan  director of happy gilmore   the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with  
again  there are faults  but  hey  everyone needs to get emotional sometimes
