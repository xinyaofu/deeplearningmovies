  being john malkovich  is the type of film we need to see more  
todays films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas  or those that have similar themes  
malkovich falls under none of these categories  and its quite refreshing to see that occur  
this strangely provoking story  is actually somewhat understandable  
john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time  
his wife  cameron diaz  supports the both of them by working at a petstore  which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment  
when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job  he finds an ad for a filing clerk  
when he reaches the building  he arrives at a   floor  
its there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for  minutes at a time  
meanwhile  cusack meets a business partner  catherine keener   in which he falls madly in love with her  
the only problem is  she has no interest in him what so ever  
the whole portal thing  isnt just a toy  in fact  it becomes cusacks dream  
being inside malkovichs mind  gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich  like a puppet  and to fulfill his fantasies  
i dont want to give away too much  but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery  
in my opinion  this idea is absolutely brilliant  
its really quite scary to think that someone could become you  control you  be you  
it makes you wonder why we act like we do  and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue  
even if the script is super sharp  i cant help but find the ending displeasing  
it could have lead up to something more  or at least an amusing conclusion  
it tried to explain a mythology about the portals  that made it seem rushed  
other than that  i had a very enjoyable time  
the acting was quite delightful as well  
john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability  and he does it well  
hes by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity  but im hoping that will change  
cameron diaz was her usual charming self  although i felt that part was wrong for her  but she pulled it off  
john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice  
who elses mind would be better to explore  
the director  spike jonze  who appeared in last months three kings really catches my attention with this project  
i knew he was bizzare  but not to this extreme  
he too is likely too receive media attention  
  being john malkovich  isnt an excellent film  but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite  
whats even better is the films puzzling message    am
