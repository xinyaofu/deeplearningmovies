perhaps its time for me to say a little about my reading habits  
i really do like to read  and ive enjoyed many books in my lifetime  
my problem is that im a slow reader  and not very dedicated  ill enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time  its taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina  even though im loving the book   
in addition to this  i typically dont read anything created after the th century  
the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting  time after time  that i havent read any of the books on which these films are based  the only exception  i believe  is great expectations   
however  i dont think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film  
needless to say  i havent read the elmore leonard novel out of sight  on which steven soderberghs new film is based  
i cant say how faithful of an adaptation it is  or if it lives up to leonards vision  
i can say that its a terrific film  with sharp acting  great dialogue  and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh  
its certainly a nice distraction from s lineup of brainless blockbusters  all hopelessly wishing that size mattered  
out of sight proves that it doesnt  
i had originally written george clooney off as a onenote actor  incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair  
after seeing his latest performance in this film  ive changed my mind  this guy can act  but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those  million superstars  
here  he plays jack foley  a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living  
he does it because its fun  i think  but the film opens with him getting caught because his car wont start  
he goes to jail  which is interesting  only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend  buddy  ving rhames   
were then introduced to karen sisco  jennifer lopez   a u  s  marshall who  conveniently  is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes  
fortunately  they take her hostage  and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety  
the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another  though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible  
we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence  and  since this is a gritty crime comedy  flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise   
at first  i kind of felt that it was a gimmick  but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction  too  
its a fun gimmick  though  and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally  
ive only seen a few of soderberghs films  i was impressed both with kafka and sex  lies  and videotape   but i think hes excellent at what he does  
hes an artist without making it obvious  and without being pretentious  which is always admirable  
he uses tricks  yes  lots of freezeframe stuff here   but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film  
as i said  clooney is terrific  and hes matched by lopez  
lopez is  of course  beautiful  but she can act  too  
i can sense that shes honing in on her skills  for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures  not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome uturn   
the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another  the best scene in the film  by far  is the seduction scene  
the brilliance of this scene is also due  in part  to soderbergh  for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later  
the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances  layered upon light dialogue  and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema  meaningful and engrossing  
the supporting cast is strong  led by the alwaysreliable ving rhames  
dennis farina  who plays karens father  is good  as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain  
steve zahn  who plays jacks nearlybrain dead accomplice glenn  steals all of his scenes  and thats in a film where every scene is already at a high level   
all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligentlyconstructed script by scott frank  
out of sight is certainly a light film  although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory  
overall  i can recommend it simply as great entertainment  
not every film has to change your life  and its nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers  
as for the book  this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at
