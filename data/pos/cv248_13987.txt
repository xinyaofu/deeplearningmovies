note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
among my fanatical ticker tapeworshipping friends  theres one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofskys darkly original pi  the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which  through analysis  will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour  
  an example of the mentality involved  if the stock price goes up like this  and then down like that  and then sharply up this way  it then will go  this  way   
while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market  knowledge check  prices up  good  prices down  bad  most of the time  at least  and hence really couldnt comment with any authority  its always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system  and besides  if it were that simple  no doubt somebody wouldve already figured it all out   
the difference in this case is that while my colleague  an otherwise assuredly realistic individual  truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster  pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its characters psychosis  
its also vastly more convincing with its argument  
  mathematics is the language of the universe   insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen  sean gullette  in a cool  mantralike voiceover which repeats throughout the picture  
since nature can be expressed in numbers  and there are patterns everywhere in nature  he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything  the ups and downs of the stock market  how many games the yankees will win this year  the flavour of jam im going to put on my toast tomorrow morning  
obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe  max lives in paranoid  selfimposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment  singlemindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system  
sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines  the elusive pursuit of a mysterious digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness  
the story  then  is basically an eccentricity  but its a clever  astute eccentricity  perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism  in an age where a dominant societal phobia is ones individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers  maxs allconsuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering  unsettling mood  
it helps matters that hes not a particularly likable protagonist  
all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max  a spindly  neuroticlooking individual who hasnt the time to indulge in pleasantries  
for a film which puts its lead character front and center  mr  gullette appears in virtually every scene   pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics  because of our ambivalence with max  were not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as were following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination  its more disturbing journey than quest  
still  we do care about maxs fate  
teetering on the edge of dementia  he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain  both fronted by deliciously perky  resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions  
as we know  in films where paranoia is a dominant element  see the truman shows laura linney character   or for that matter  in real life  its always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary  
pi  a film that addresses patterns  itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle  headache scene  important revelation or bit of plot development  pillpopping montage  hallucinatory nightmare  with decidedly cronenbergesque undertones  few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and bodythemed horror   nosebleeding reality  
the repetitiveness  far from being tedious  is effectively maddening  more than anything  the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from maxs claustrophobic perspective  
in this regard  it wildly succeeds due to mr  aronofskys striking direction  
its a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonists warped perspective of his surrounding  and high contrast blackandwhite cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme closeups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings  
  in some scenes  the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr  gullette make his character curiously resemble a latterday max schreck  from nosferatu   
using savage  jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation  the picture is often dizzying to behold  and maxs effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the socalled snorri cam  which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts  
pis raw  aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynchs early work  in particular  eraserhead   
the films sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell  and gradually increases in intensity  
still  amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood  pi does occasionally display a sense of humour  
at one point  marcy dawson  pamela hart  great fun  entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure  a oneofakind    
computer chip  
  isnt it beautiful   she coos  
a showcase for mr  aronofskys technical virtuosity  made for    its since gone on to capture acclaim at the  sundance film festival   pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which  ironically  is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year
