upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits  i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be  hellraiser meets the crow   
but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue  describing  the strangers  and their reasons for contacting human beings  i was hooked  
there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice  
i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character  
sutherland played the role as a true veteran  
upon the completion of his monologue  the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography  
i would imagine  for a film of this caliber  that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most  
the film flowed beautifully  
as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the  dark city   a clever plot began to unravel  to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in  the usual suspects   
not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy  
but if youre not exactly the biggest scifi fan  caveat emptor  
get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of   monkeys  or  the crow  without the boredom or depression  
the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as   monkeys  was  however  so be prepared and be sophisticated  
and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comicbookgonefeaturefilm fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of  
dark city simply puts  spawn  to shame  
in fact  during the climax of the film i couldnt help but feel the strong presence of an  akira  esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie  
so my initial predictions were wrong  
this film is anything but the meloncholy of  hellraiser  parts one through five  
im never one to base a film entirly on special effects  so know that when i give dark city 
its actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even  tsk  tsk  special effects  
not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away  
the best film ive seen all year  and easily one of the best ive ever seen
