  good will hunting  is two movies in one  an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood   prodigy child  film complete with upbeats  downfalls  sporadically moving situations and plenty  plenty of shtick  
unusually directed by gus van sant   good will hunting  overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh  new talent  
the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical  rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor  stellan skarsgard   who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams  
in a nutshell  thats it  
the core of the  good will hunting  is damon  who infuses the script  co written by  chasing amys  ben affleck  with just the right amount of warmth  sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi talented performer  
but its the acting that hits the mark  and damon hits all the right notes  flying over robin williams dejavu role   awakenings  was written all over this  as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wifes tragic death  
damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious  confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein  
his rich  complex character is the pulp of  good will hunting   
everything else pales in comparison  
  good will hunting  exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling  but  unlike  little man tate  or  phenomenon   it doesnt set up its story in a black and white  point a to point b be manner  but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesnt automatically signify he must make easy  familiar choices  like the protagonists in the aforementioned
