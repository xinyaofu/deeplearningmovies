curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy  but its humour wont appeal to everyone  
to be specific  let me give you an example  
do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated  
if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny  dont see curdled  
on the other hand  if you found that sequence to be pretty funny  you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at  
our films heroine  gabriela  played by angela jones  is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers  she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles  
luckily for her  miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage  her scrapbook is getting pretty big  
the killers nickname in the press is the blue blood killer  because he preys on older rich socialite women  and hes played by william baldwin  this is not a spoiler   
one particularly striking m  o  
on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims  
gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests  
she immediately quits her job  and signs on with pfcs  which stands for postforensic cleaning service  
no points for guessing what they do  
her workmates are confused by gabrielas fascination with murder  to them  its just a day job  
theres a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk  and what they would say  
gabrielas partner  elena  played by mel gorham  is particularly perturbed by gabrielas wideeyed fascination  and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killers latest scene  theyre the messiest  you see  
unbeknownst to them  the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer  so hes also heading over there   
the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental  quentin tarantino executiveproduced this film  which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival  
apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a featurelength film  
there are other parallels  the star of curdled is angela jones  the top billing goes to william baldwin  but really  jones is the central character   whos probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos  the deathobssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction  
that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film  curdled jr  
jones is great in curdled  shes wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wideeyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her characters innocence or likeability  
she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow  
its a great performance  
reb braddocks direction is extremely sharp and clever  toeing the line between black humour and bad taste  
the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing  any more than that would be a spoiler  
the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing  
of course  its impossible to really take this stuff seriously  but then again youre not really supposed to  braddock knows the audience is in on the joke  and makes it a fun little romp as a result  
the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film  and it feels like it  the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time  and some parts just seem to drag  
while its running time is already a short  minutes  it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing  
curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax  
itll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well
