it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste  
indeed  
while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungeejumping  they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration  
i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool  this movie creeps up on youat a slow  minutes  i mean creepsand despite the final shots ambiguity  i left completely satisfied  
henry fool   used to have an  e   arrives at garbageman simon grims house  claims the vacant basement apartment  and almost instantly inspires simon  urbaniak  to take up writinghenry  martin donovan lookalike ryan  is an exconvict  a oncegreat author who has been  exiled and marginalized  by the publishing community because of his criminal activity  
simons poetry turns him into a local sensation  as it causes mute women to sing  highschool girls to swoon  and councilmen to rile against its  pornographic  content  
meanwhile  henry seduces both simons dependent mother  porter  and immature sister  sundance queen posey  with philosophical babble  which is by turns brilliant and inane  and breathy animal lust  
these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable  the teacherstudent relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself  
henry fool is sprinkled with hartleyian flourishes  simon drinks milk from  udderleys   the big teen hangout is called  world of donuts   simon wears his garbagemans uniform throughout  the editing style is decidedly elliptical    
  which is key to the conclusions said ambiguity   
the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first  selfconsciously  quirky   the introductory scenes are a chore  
these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion  a belief in themselves  and because they have longterm goals  henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner  but they arent pop slackers  
the story is rather classical  the tutor is a better talker than a doer  raised on books  the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of  
  shades of film school     
the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small  and the final third does test ones patience  yet henry fool is tight  hardly excessive in its length  
how refreshing to see a movie this long in  devoted entirely to character  
and unless i nodded off  not a single building exploded  
this  hartleys seventh feature  is contemplative about  the artist   fortunately  we never get a sampling of simons work  and its a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers pens
