most people fit into two different categories  you either love woody allen  or you hate his guts  
my family  for the most part  hates him and his movies  
i think hes very funny  but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries  allens humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allens intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in   a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something theyd never seen before  
toy story used stateoftheart computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film  but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz  however  has upped the ante considerably  
disneys a bugs life isnt due out for another two months  and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out  they have satisfied the audiences thirst for computeranimated films  
but dont let that fool you  disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years  competitions have broken out between studios  
in   it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion  dantes peak came out way ahead of its predecessor  both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise  but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in   there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition  and armageddon blew away its cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now  its even more interesting  as one beloved studio  disney  goes up against the newcomer  dreamworks   
who will prevail  
time will tell  but im sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didnt like antz  on the contrary  id put it up there with toy story  
but due to its pg rating  many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldnt appear in disneys version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a familyoriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally  which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults  though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often  entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allens shtick and franz kafkas metamorphosis  the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z  allen  is a troubled ant  believing he was not made to be a worker  
  when youre the middle child in a family of five million     he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night  z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver  sylvester stallone   discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala  sharon stone   whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance  and they engage in a pulp fictionesque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess  z falls in love  but theres a problem  bala is getting married to general mandible  gene hackman   a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  
in order to do that  he must eliminate not only the queen  anne bancroft   but the weakest of the colony  namely the worker ants  
but to get rid of the queen  he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  
he and colonel cutter  christopher walkin  come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle  where they will surely be killed  
the queen is reluctant at first  but decides it is best for the colony  
meanwhile  z wants to meet bala again  and he asks weaver  an army ant  to switch places with him  
so z gets sent off to battle  but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites  
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning  though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers  which contained a very similar sequence  
however  antz and that  film were both in production around the same time  so the similarities are merely coincidence  
the second half of the film revolves around zs kidnapping of bala  and their search for a mythical place called insectopia  
there  an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants  
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension  especially one involving a magnifying glass  
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day  in fact  im just going to assume that the producers referenced id intentionally   
the ants look up in awe  and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground  
visually  its an exciting rush of adrenaline  
but dont be fooled    
little kids shouldnt see this  as they may just try and copy it  
after seeing antz  i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again  
hopefully  children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel  
as an animated film  antz is probably the best you will find to date  
visually  its as stunning as what dreams may come  
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters arent limited by gravity  
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible  
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball  
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball  
however  the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boys shoe  
its truly a great example of film making at its finest  
with computer technology  the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar to the actors providing the voices  
the best example would have to be barbatus  danny glover   
at one point  you can even see the pores on his face  although  i doubt ants have pores    
do they    
barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body  
young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head  but a good deal of humor is derived  more appropriate for adults  of course   
disneys a bugs life looks good  but i dont know if they will be able to best dreamworks newest animated feature in terms of animation  
if not  then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do  go head to head with the big mouse  and knock him down  yes  anastasia was good  but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney   
vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature  and antz has one of the best lineups seen since toy story  
in fact  it far exceeds that one  
woody allen has always been funny  but here he transcends most of what hes done in the past few years  
without a body  his comic timing is the most noticeable thing  
in fact  im pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines  
sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability  though for the most part  stone works best as a dramatic actress  
sylvester stallone  teamed up with stone once again  is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor  not a typecast action star  
after a snub at the oscars last year  stallone is proving himself as the serious  or comedic  as illustrated here  actor that he is  
gene hackman is superb as the grufftalking general  almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona  
christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice  and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns  
anne bancroft has a minimal role  but shes effective nonetheless  
danny glover has a small role  but he does a very  very good job  
dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick  eurotrash beesboth are very unrecognizable  especially aykroyd  
jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver  although most people wont recognize her voice either  
many people will recognize grant shauds voice as the foreman  
he played miles on the tv show murphy brown  
this is definitely a huge cast with some highprofile names  and it will definitely help its grosses  
of course  you can probably tell where a lot of the  million budget went to  also  
directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers  though guterman did direct a  feature  headless    
but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture  
tense at times  and very funny throughout  the two hold this film together like professionals  
the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot  but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults  
kids will delight in the animation  while parents can laugh heartily at the humor  
most of it will go over young childrens heads  
does that mean you shouldnt take kids to see it  
not at all  
they will have a lot of fun watching this one  
what is great is the themes that are given to us  
part social commentary  part romance story  and part moral drama  antz gives everyone something to talk about  whether it be the animation  or the discussions of individualism and community  
thankfully  its not subtle in either aspects  
antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action  
sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie  but the violence is what should keep kids at home  
the battle scene has ants melting in acid  and bugs being speared to death  
and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight  
but other than that  and some sexual innuendos   its a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters  
i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough  but its still advisable to leave really young children at home  
have i confused you enough  
if you do take your kids  i recommend seeing the film with them  because more than likely  youll enjoy it the most
