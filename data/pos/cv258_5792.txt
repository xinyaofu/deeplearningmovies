jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh boxsets on the video shelves  he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the welloff  
maybe its a classic case of displacement  its easier to see jarvis own lyrics  obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall  as a fetishization of lowlife  rather than leighs films  
but its worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of workingclass characters dont make for a guarantee of authenticity  let alone a good film  
its the triumph of secrets  lies  then  that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek authenticity and honesty in everyday lives  
following her adopted mothers funeral  hortense  a young black optometrist  sets out to find her birth mother  and is disturbed to find out that she is white  
it is cynthia  a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne  
cynthias younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages  largely because of his wifes animosity towards her  
hortense calls up cynthia  who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her  
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually  
cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party  which maurice is hosting    
secrets  lies has a simple enough theme at its heart  as one character puts it   best to tell the truth  isnt it  
that way nobody gets hurt    
but if the film delivers much more than a trite message  its because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths  even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us  
hence  cynthias difficulty with acknowledging  first to herself  then to others  that hortense is her daughter  
one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever  been with a black man   before a longsuppressed memory seizes her  
at the party  cynthias pretense that hortense is her factory coworker leads her to ever more convoluted lies  as agonizing as they are funny  
little lies seep into every corner  like maurice pretending that hes  just dropping by  when he visits cynthia after much deliberation  
maurices job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme  a sadlooking bride that maurice coaxes to smile  a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles  
one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face  she says she needs the photo to look  as bad as possible  to collect insurance money  yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars  
there are occasionally hilarious moments  as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception   ive got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs   or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne   if youve got it  flaunt it  is what i say   
as played by brenda blethyn  cynthia comes close to being a caricature  with her nervous  somewhat disconnected way of talking  
but shes really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her  precisely because shes so needy of love  perhaps  
indeed  the whole cast gives warmly rounded  detailed performances  
the script was developed partly through improvisations  and the fusion of cast  script and director shows best in the party scene  seemingly everyone is talking at the same time  and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout  
in a very different way  but also using a long single shot  the scene of hortense and cynthias first meeting in a lonely cafa achieves a touching intensity  all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings  
the films climax  with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsenesque revelations  and everybody hugging each other  is the one thing that seems false about this film  
however  its a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the characters lives  
when cynthia says near the end  this is the life  innit   you get the sense that  following the cynicism of his last film naked  leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all  without comforting illusions  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
