the  summer movie season is still in its infancy  
but after diasappointing films such as  godzilla  and  fear and loathing in las vegas   it would be nice to see a really good film  
but i doubt you could have expected this  
the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen  and it deserves a spot on the  decades best  list  
there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim   yes  thats what makes this film great   
the blend of peter weirs masterful  and in many ways brilliant  direction  peter bizious stunning photography and jim carreys performance is what makes this film work so fantastically  
there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show  
it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame  but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect  
carrey has made a very wise choice  
by playing mildmannered truman burbank  he allows himself enough room to be comical  and therefore not alienating his true fans  while still showing a vulnerable and human side  
that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes  
truman burbank was born to an audience of millions  
he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a  hour television show  
everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians  led by the shows director  christof  played by ed harris   
everyone in trumans life is an actor or an extra  
they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe  people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in trumans life  
but he is the only person that is not aware of it  
the classification of the truman show may be tricky  
the audience reacted to many of trumans revelations with laughter  
i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character  
the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes  because what was happening to him  indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong  
so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy  
a drama  
it really depends on the audience  
but to me  the truman show was a touching  sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others  
but above all else  the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor  heart and scary realism  
oscar predictions in june are pointless  but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of   as originally planned  james cameron would be oscarless
