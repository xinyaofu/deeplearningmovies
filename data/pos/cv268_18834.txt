the happy bastards quick movie review 
analyze this 
how does one do a comedy focused on the mob  
well  a few years ago  there was a sly little comedy called the freshman  which had marlon brando doing a romp of a sendup of his famous don corleone character and  recently  the utterly stupid  in a bad way  movie mafia  
failed to really get the joke  
this time around  however  warner bros  may have gotten it right with analyze this  a movie that hits its targets more than it misses    and 
for plenty of reasons  
the story goes like this  
a mobster  robert deniro  finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late  fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a neardeath following a driveby shooting  
its these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist  billy crystal  whos mostly reluctant to take the mobsters case for two reasons  
first  of course  hes a mobster  but secondly  hes trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife  lisa kudrow  and kid  
and  of course  he cant rest worth for a moment because the mobsters goons are always needing the shrink for something  be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation  
fortunately  the movie is played out for plenty of laughs  
director harold ramis  who also helmed the comedy multiplicity  which wasnt half bad  keeps the tone peppy and light  even if its sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments  shootings cant always be taken for laughs  you know   
deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy  giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas  but with a bit of a lighter heart  
  a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious   
crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniros character  uplifting him from such bombs as fathers day and my giant  
kudrow is also a hoot as crystals wifetobe  whos on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniros presence  
is the movie perfect  
not really  thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri  hes a comic actor  too  come on  give him some more    but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change  taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy  
kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show  either  
line of the movie  crystal   when you said you needed family therapy  this is not the family i had in mind
