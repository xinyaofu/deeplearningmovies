you may not have heard of lucas  or if you have  you might not think much of it  
probably because it stars corey haim  or maybe because its about a little geek who collects insects  or maybe because it doesnt feature slick oneliners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the s  
however  you have been missing out on a true masterpeice  the best film of   and the best film about adolescent life ever made  
corey haim stars as lucas bligh  a tiny  year old with scruffy hair  thick glasses  and an interest in insects and other outdoor life  
one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him  
her name is maggie  a  year old who certainly is a beauty  with lovely red hair and a sweet  innocent complexion  
maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her  but somehow he interests her  and soon they are talking and getting to know one another  
they gradually become good friends  and spend the summer together doing various things  such as studying insects  namely locusts  who come out of hiding once every  years   playing tennis  and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover  
lucas is obviously in love with maggie  and while she is charmed by him  its clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend  
this is not clear to lucas  however  
he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate  and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows whats about to happen  
we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally  
they throw him on stage  right in front of his beloved maggie  
surprisingly  he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around  but he takes it too far  and is embarassed in front of the entire school  
the next scene is brilliant  
maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally  
she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened  
he rails back against her  in a cruel unfair fashion  
in lesser movies this wouldve turned into a confrontation between the two characters  
but maggie is written smarter than that  
she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him  
next we are introduced to another great character named cappie  charlie sheen   
he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend  
whats interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks  
of course anyone with a brain can tell whats gonna happen next  
cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas relationship  
this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone  
shes been assigned to show him how to operate the washerdryer so he can clean his shirt  
maggie is charmed by cappies tender undertsanding demeanor  not to mention his shirtless body  
this scene is so delicate and sweet  but cappie still has a girlfriend  preventing either one from acting on their desires  
desperately trying to puncture the tension  cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room  
its not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend  in the films only subpar scene   
lucas finally figures out whats going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance  
this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself  such as try out for the football team  
the last third of the film revolves around this attempt  
while the idea seems cliched  the way it is executed is not  
there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up  
dave grusins memorable score  played at the perfect moments  certainly helps  
lucas is filled with great performances  
forget everything you know about corey haim  
back in  he had talent  and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully dimensional performance filled with anger  humor  and pain  
kerri green is very appealing as maggie  showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her  
sheens cappie is almost too good to be true  but sheen makes him beleivable  especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas  
there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popittis ben  a friend of lucas  whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks  
also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina  the girl who admires lucas from afar  
when people talk about the great teen angst films of the s  you hear john hughes this and john hughes that  
lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his socalled classics  
but hopefully  like with heathers and say anything  lucas can begin to find its own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald  
it deserves more than that  but i dont want to be greedy
