trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semidramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda  the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter  
the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the s  then cut to the harsh reality of the present  
sheffield has become some sort of a semislum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steelfactories  a once flourishing industry  
gaz  carlyle  spends most of his time in the workers club  a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers  
he and his plump friend dave  addy  as well as their former foreman gerald  wilkinson  have been sitting around the club for months without any call for duty  
what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the  pounds of childsupport money to his exwife  
suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son  he goes on to concoct an enterprising wildidea to get the money he desperately requires  
dave and gerald too have problems of their own  
on top of his lack of employment  dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as hisplump appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as  months  leaving home for work when he was actually a longstanding member of the workers club  
there we have it  people with real problems and a notsopractical solution for them  
gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag  to perform a stripact at the local pub  
in gazs own words while looking at an add for a stripact featuring hunky beautiful men  if women are willing to pay for this  they sure as well will pay for realmen  
the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all  
it is a small film which delves in the harshreality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to  
it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of humanfactor going for it  
never for once  was it trying to be manipulative at all  the full monty was true to itself all the way  
while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high  audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh  something lacking in many comedy films  wannabes   from hollywood  
other than carlyle  who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting  the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me onscreen  
however  the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying  
carlyles work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting  implying real acting skill and flexibility onscreen  
kudos to the people involved in this film  especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your justanotherstriptease  
already a critical and financial success for such a small film  the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout  
while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way  the full monty gives one the same satisfaction    in 
half the time
