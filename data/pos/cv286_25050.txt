according to hollywood movies made in last few decades  life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being  
even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark  godforsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience  
on the other hand  it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america  because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view  
this film is amarcord   comedy by famous italian director federico fellini  which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages  and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life  
the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense  
instead we follow one year in s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs  as well as series of local  often very colourful characters  
although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator  movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist  year old boy titta  played by bruno zanin  and chronicles his sexual frustrations  obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca  played by magali noel   problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family  as well as troubles his father  played by armando brancia  have with mussolinis fascist regime  
amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film  and it probably explains why it is very popular  even among those people who actually dont like federico fellinis work very much  
every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film  because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible  
distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film  word  amarcord  is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase  i remember  in local italian dialect  
in the same way the word is distorted  so is the past in memories of those who remember it  
after the premiere  fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film  but it doesnt matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellinis childhood or not  any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film  
fellinis views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film  
even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images  
characters look like caricatures  actors playing them often deliberately overact  and women  especially those who fuel tittas sexual fantasies  often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions  
every now and then  scenes that depict s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movies characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters visions  
because of that  almost everything in this film looks different  and in most cases better  than it would have looked in the real life  
even the fascism gets fellinian makeover  fellini views mussolinis totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle  explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history  and opportunity for comedy  
when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents  even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour  
unlike many of his italian colleagues in s  who had used s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda  fellini doesnt care that much about politics  
lack of selfrighteous moral perspective is compensated with fellinis humanistic approach to his characters  
each of them  regardless of age  gender  social class or physical appearance  is given opportunity to express his or her views  dreams and fears  
fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection  even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people  
because of this warmth and democratic spirit  amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of th century  and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable  melancholic and even tragic moments  
fellini couldnt produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie  
vignettes arent memorable because of the characters only  fellini uses camera  painting film in bright colours  especially in the scenes that depict characters fantasies  
fellini also knows how to use locations  whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel  brightcoloured beach or rural countryside  
even the downtoearth streets of rimini  where everyone knows everyone  gets magical dimension during the snowfall  
on the other hand  lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene  
this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellinis longtime associate nino rota  
his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable  most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced  
that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art
