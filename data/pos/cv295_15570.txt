lean  mean  escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by  
most are unnecessarily complicated  and others have no sense of expediency  the thrillride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot  
perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive  which featured none of the flashbang effects of todays market but rather a breadandbutter  textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about  
the latest tony scott movie  enemy of the state  doesnt make it to that level  
its a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers  without looking back  
although director scott has made missteps in the past  such as the lame thriller the fan  hes generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun  
that vibrant spirit is present here  shown in welltimed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed  
enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography  director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views  angles  lenses  and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie  
enemy is truly a visual experience  and thats only one of the reasons its such a fun watch  
the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds  jon voight   
reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment  but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee  
reynolds has the senator offed  but not before the murder is caught on a naturalists camera  
by an extremist chain of events  the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean  will smith  s posession  and its not long before hes running from reynolds cronies  
its only with the help of an exspook named brill  gene hackman  that dean is able to get to the bottom of things  
the acting is top notch  and the three principles  smith  hackman  and voight  are generally more mature and excellent all around  
smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being  voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence  and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role  
smiths regular joe comes off particularly well  as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not  
the supports are also in fine form  lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas  
this is  for the holiday crowd  the hot ticket  as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking
