this film is based on the campy tv show from the s under the same appellation  
mind you  most people  including yours truly  who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series  
the movie is really a stand alone in that regard  
the family robinson    lost in space  
plot  set in the year   the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future  
a colonization process  if you will  
they are joined by able pilot west  leblanc   and evil uninvited stowaway  oldman   who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip  
eventually  their trek goes awry  and all are  lost in space   
  how do get back to earth   
is the question that infests the rest of this scifi epic  
critique  this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element      from the summer of   
its a film with a lot of flash  but very little actual substance  
admittedly  there isnt an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film  but this film does run a little too long  and did lose me in regards to its complex timetravel  multidimensional story line  
having said that  the special effects in this movie were amazing  and the overall look and feel were also way above average  
you really felt like you were in the future  and riding through space with these poor souls  
unfortunately for this chosen family  their year old son is the smartest one in the group  and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family  ever heard that one before  
yawn    
the acting is ok  and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friends matt leblanc who shows us all that hes definitely more than just a pretty face  
on the down side  the family riffraff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and timeconsuming  even though we gotta give them credit for  trying  to develop characters in a scifi pic   the story line is hard to follow  the evil character in the movie actually tells people that hes  evil   and the movie goes on for about  minutes too long  
on the slick side  many of the special effects are really cool  the sequence in which the family is  paralyzed  during the hyperdrive is awesome  and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool   the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming  and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling  i will also admit that  somehow  they got me to semitear up near the conclusion of this picture     very 
odd        
overall  if youre a big scifi fan  check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative  and if youre not  i would still suggest seeing this movie  but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts  
little known facts  this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic    out of the top spot at the boxoffice after  straight weeks at number one
