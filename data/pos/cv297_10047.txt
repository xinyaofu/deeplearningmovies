s alien marked not only the death  by suicide  of its popular protagonist  ellen ripley  sigourney weaver   but  in many ways  the alien franchise itselfbox office receipts were anemic  thanks to poor audience word of mouth  and the critics who rallied around the first two installments  s alien and s aliens  savaged david finchers slog of a sendoff  myself included   
hence  weaver  director jeanpierre jeunet  and the others behind alien resurrection faced a twofold challengenot only somehow resurrect ripley  but also rescue this onceprofitable series from the scrap heap  
despite the odds  they have succeeded  even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two  
writer joss whedon devises a quick  easy  and painless answer to the dead ripley problemclone her  which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina   the prison planet of the third film  
that done  the real challenge presents itselfwhat do with her  
alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful  aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable  exploring her maternal side  alien saw her undergoing the seven stages of death  
what could be next  
whedon comes up with a clever spin  since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen  the blood used for the clone is also  infected  with alien dna  
so the new ripley is  indeed  newa humanalien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength  a psychic bond with the deadly species  and a more predatory attitude  
unfortunately  that is where alien resurrections clever streak in writing stops  
the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features  
but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought  
the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding  but once the creatures break free  it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew  this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers  including tough waif call  played by a game winona ryder  trying to exterminate them  
and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential  i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy  
while the settling into triedandtrue formula is a little disconcerting  the formula is triedandtrue for a reason  and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon  
the alien  after all these years  is still terrifying  and a new breed that is introduced is no less so  
the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme  and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting  most notably an extended underwater sequence  
the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually  thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji  
as technically adept as jeunets direction is  perhaps his  and  for that matter  whedons  greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series  
a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for  but the selfawareness of the excess just adds to the fun  
no  alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scotts alien or the even greater film that james camerons aliens was  
but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of finchers alien  jeunets resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild  reckless thrill ride  
that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place  and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments
