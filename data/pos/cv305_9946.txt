of all the films ive come to see this year     i think only chasing amy had as many  laughoutloud  moments  
im not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman  but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes  
and i think im the kind of person that laughs least at movies  even when i find them funny  
usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile  so to get me laughing out loud  and so frequently  is a really good sign  
waiting for guffman is the story of blaine  missouri  a town celebrating its th anniversary  and the musical that is being put on for the big event  
the play is being directed by corky st  clair  christopher guest  who also wrote and directed this  mockumentary  as well as cowriting several original musical numbers   the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success  
teaming up with st  clair are a handful of blaine residents  allan pearl  eugene levy   a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown  but sitting right next to him and studying him  ron and sheila albertson  fred willard and catherine ohara respectively   a married couple setting their sights on hollywood  libby mae brown  parker posey   the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen  and a few others  
everybody in this movie is brilliant  absolutely so  but levy particularly stands out  
these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you cant help but love them  as pathetic as they really are  
although levy stands out  guest  willard  ohara  and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances  
if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance  this is the group that should sweep it  
some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and  even after starting very humorously  they nearly lost me with the tadtoolong intros  
as delightful as it was  it began to get monotonous  
thankfully  just as your about to say  ok  maybe i should run to the bathroom   they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes  
like a play  this film gives a very threeact feel  the intros  funny  but almost too long   the rehearsals  even funnier   and finally  the actual performance of the play  excellent    
like i said  each character really shines  even when done with a subtle approach  
you cant really watch these people and not think theyre real people  
even they way they talk  with awkward pauses and stumbles that dont feel staged at all  you feel like youre watching a real  albeit funny  documentary  
and even with silly lyrics  the original songs when the play is finally put on  are absolutely wonderful  
as a word of note  despite its  r  rating  waiting for guffman is really quite clean  
this rating came from a brief  very brief use of the granddaddy of all swear words  
even if that really bothers you  let me say that its not presented in a vulgar  cheaplaugh way  
its actually quite humorous and tastefully done  
it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman  
its silly humor  but its also so dry  subtle  and intelligently done that youre not insulted by it  
its always really nice to see a comedy that isnt all slapstick and vulgarity  and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones  
id recommend seeing it
