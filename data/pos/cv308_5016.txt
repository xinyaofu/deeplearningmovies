the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane  
billy  played by michael keaton  is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble  
christopher lloyd portrays henry  an obsessivecompulsive who requires that everything be neat  orderly  on schedule  and by the books  
he thinks hes a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports  
jack  played by peter boyle  thinks hes jesus  
and finally  theres stephen furst as albert  a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases  
the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the foursome when their psychiatrist  dr  weitzman  takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium  
during a pit stop  they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan  
the movies charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast  
the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively  they never miss an opportunity to argue  bicker  or insult one another  
henry and jack  for example  fight over whos going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game  
the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other  
michael keaton is well cast as billy  he gives his cynical character considerable complexity  
as the divinely jack  peter boyle succeeds in keeping his onedimensional character funny and fresh  
although stephen fursts catatonic character is cliched  the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing  
while keaton  boyle  and furst are good  its christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special  
lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance  
his body language  for example  the way he walks  and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character  
lloyds brilliant performance yields a pathetic  moving  and memorable character  
the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise  
the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot
