confession time  i have never  ever seen gone with the wind  
i dont know why  really  
havent wanted to check it out on video  havent been at home the nights it was on network tv  and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the bigscreen  
so right up front  ill admit that i dont know what the heck im talking about  but here goes    
is titanic the gone with the wind of the s  
maybe thats going a little bit too far  
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie  theyre no clark gable and vivien leigh  
but    
the parallels are there  
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available  technicolor  
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors  
gwtw places americas greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story  titanic does the same with the atlantics most legendary tragedy  
they both have strongwilled redheaded heroines  they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slavessteerage bums  they were both incredibly expensive and popular    
ok  maybe thats not enough parallels  
so titanics not in gwtws league  
no matter  
titanic is a great movie in its own right  complete with spills  thrills and  especially  chills  
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production  and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again  
the money was obviously wellspent  
the costumes look great  the sets look great  the cgi graphics look great  
i especially liked the expensive little touches  like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks  
but writerdirectorproducer james camerons real challenge in writingdirecting producing titanic wasnt just costuming and set design and special effects  
camerons major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in  
he succeeds masterfully  
cameron does two things that work incredibly well  
first  he shows us modernday salvage operations on titanic  thats just  titanic   not  the titanic   mind you   
the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state  corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic  from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett  bill paxton   
television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues yearold rose calvert  gloria stuart   who survived the wreck in   
stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role  narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew  
secondly  cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character  and the romantic triangle between rose  winslet   her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley  billy zane  and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon  dicaprio   
the way that bigbudget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an allstar cast  so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people  
cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack  while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board  
the supporting cast is professional  but mostly anonymous  other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown  theres no moment when you stop and say  oh  yeah  i know him  whats he been in  
  although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform  or even as the illfated engineer   
the love story itself is rather conventional  
i think some reviewers found it weak  and that may be a fair criticism  
the performances are the key here  
zane has the meatiest part in the movie  and he plays the arrogant  condescending steel millionaire to the hilt  
hes smooth  he looks great in a tuxedo  and hes a convincing enough jerk that the winsletdicaprio relationship looks plausible  
at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat  you can hear the wheels in his mind turning  saying not  can i save this little girl    
but  can she help me get on a lifeboat   
dicaprio is a revelation  
i hadnt seen him before in anything  and didnt know what the heck to expect  really  
  honestly  i expected a bad irish accent  but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea  so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game   
dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive  and being on the titanic  that its hard not to like him  
from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg  dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest  and he never falters  
winslets character grows up a lot during the movie  and so does her performance  
at first  shes not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look dropdead gorgeous  
we know from the narration that shes monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane  but there isnt any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio  
winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg  
its at that moment where winslets character really comes alive  
faced with real danger  she drops her spoiledrichgirl mannerisms and does a splendid job  
as rose and jack race around the doomed ship  looking for shelter from the freezing water and cals fiery temper  winslet turns in a superb acting performance  mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror  
of course  the most interesting character is the ship itself  
cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic  and shows her in every mood  as a deserted wreck  down in the boiler room  up on the bridge  down in the hold  at the captains table  down in steerage  and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead  
camerons greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well
