only a year after the initial release of  scream   the horror sendup from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre  the inevitable sequel  scream   has arrived in our theaters  
while the tongueincheek  parodic element is still noticeable in this film  its really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story  
the first film  while often violent and gruesome  was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant  
the premise of  scream   is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called  stab   based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers  courtney cox  about the events in  scream   is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening  
i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy  
its conclusion  in which a bleeding  wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think its a publicity stunt  is more surreal and disturbing than anything else  
the satire in  scream   thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general  
although resident horror film geek randy  jamie kennedy  is back with fresh dialogue about sequels  and  interestingly enough  how they are usually inferior to their predecessors   the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well  
everything from  friends  and  saved by the bell  to  showgirls  and  terminator   is referenced here  horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning  and there arent any  wes carpenter  jokes this time  
more importantly  this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film  
the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from  scream   in fact  the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense   weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety  and one man seems willing to save the heroines life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show  
understandably   scream   does not go so far as to actually blame the movies  but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted  
couple that with the fact that several of the characters  most notably the lead character sidney prescott  neve campbell   are fairly welldeveloped and that there are some genuine moments of spinechilling suspense  and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right  
we dont just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore  we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered  and  in one case  a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust  and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner  
while i have not seen any of his other work  its easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated  slasher film  director  as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing  
unfortunately   scream   occasionally reverts to the timehonored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window  
for example  several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later  there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick  but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion  
there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that  s  he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction  
as for the question of whether or not  scream   is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor  
  
  
well  its hard to say  
i gave the first  scream    stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a lighthearted sendup  
  scream   bounces all over the place stylistically  but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment  
im not sure which is the better movie  but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing  sequels  however much randy might argue  do not necessarily suck
