produced by robert lantos  stephen j  roth 
directed by douglas williams 
mpaa  not rated  though from language  violence  medicalgrossouts  and sexual content  id put it at pg  
though made in canada   overdrawn at the memory bank  traces its roots to the bbc school of film production  
using  for the most part  cheap computer and video special effects  chyron text  wildlife documentary footage  and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up  it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time youre twenty minutes into it  you should be hooked  
raul julia plays aram fingal  a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority  
caught watching  casablanca  on his desk monitor  fingal is sentenced to  doppling  rehabilitationhe is to spend fortyeight hours in the body of a baboon  
  how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybodys guess   
as it happens  thanks to a visiting schoolboys prank  his body is temporarily misplaced  and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it  
as time ticks away before his memory cube selfdestructs  the frantic search for his body is on    while 
fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world  then finds theres no better way to hack the system than from the inside  
during the chaos  computer technician apollonia james  linda griffiths  maintains contact with fingal through a datalink  manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings  
over the course of their interactions  interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance  
given that  casablanca  is fingals favorite film  and the basis for his fantasy world  a great deal of the movie is homage to  casablanca   
in fact  the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances  played by julia in a dual role and louis negin  respectively  in a bar called  the place   
julias portrayal of bogart is passable  and avoids becoming the  schweethaat  spouting parody seen in cartoons  
negins peter lorre is quite credible  and easily the best peter lorre ive ever seen who wasnt the real thing  
the two of them  as characters created by fingals imagination  serve as aspects of his personality  driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system  
those arent the only casablanca characters to put in appearances  
the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around    as  the fat man   the alternate aspect of the films main villain  the novicorp chairman  donald c  moore   
while fingals body is lost  the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system    with 
less than salutory results  
its interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film  in the best goldenage science fiction tradition  
words like  dopple    psychist    computech    cinema   and  reconst  are apparently in common use  
and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years pasts idea of futuristic data processing clerks  some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of  virtual reality  today  
as cyberpunk films go  this may not be a staple of the genre  but its definitely recommended viewing  
the special effects are very primitive  placing this production in the realm of lowtomediumbudget television  
the music is completely electronicsynthesized  which fits the low budget but isnt really out of keeping with the genre  
however  the writing quite makes up for it  
there are some very funny moments  and quite a few little injokes that one needs to have seen  casablanca  to appreciate properly  
all in all  i give  overdrawn at the memory bank  a
