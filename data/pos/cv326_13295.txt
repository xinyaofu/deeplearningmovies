most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy  
rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category  but manages to be slightly unique  
the rocky formula of  rocky loses fightrocky trainsrocky wins fight  is carried out to the letter  
also the tradition of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well  
this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky  sylvester stallone  has become    
even showing a brief appearance on sesame street   
then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips  hulk hogan   
a mysterious badass known as clubber lang  mr  t  trashtalks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he  pities the fool  for not coming out and fighting him outright  
rockys trainer  burgess meredith  tells rocky not to fight  but the italian stallion doesnt listen  
naturally  he gets his ass kicked  
somewhere along the line after this several things happen  
rockys longtime trainer dies  causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed  
rockys wife complains to her husband that he should fight  
the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky  
guess who wins  
the winners name rhymes with smocky  
the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber langs over the top performance  
the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film  
which is good if you like fighting scenes  
the last match is quite decent actually  
if you liked the previous films  rent this one  
its well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series  
but if you cant stand rocky shouting  adrianne     
one more time  see something else
