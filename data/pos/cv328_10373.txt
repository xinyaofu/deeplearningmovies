do film critics have morals  
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow  
naturally we dont want to go into a film with any preconceived notions  which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  
secondly  and along the same line  we cant prejudge a film because of its stars  director  etc  the difference  
well  in the first one  wed go into a film thinking its going to be dumb or its going to be good  and that would affect our viewing  that movie sounds and looks dumb  so im not expecting much   
on the second hand  were simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal  grudge  against the film company  its made by disney  
oh  its just a merchandising ploy then   the actors  jim carreys in it  
its gonna stink    or the director  who  
cant be that good   
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint  
make sense  
ok  but what about comparing  
isnt that kind of along the same lines  
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composers credibility in one film to another they were involved in  is that really fair  
sure  in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more  but what about jackie brown  for example  
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction  just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both  
i think it is  and ill tell you why  
a good critic should be able to view the film from the  average joe  or jane   viewpoint  while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  
sometimes that can be tough  
  the acting was superb  but i was bored  or  i loved it   
it was sooooo cheezy   
might be used to describe a film  
these are contradictions  and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique  
but which is more important  
and which is better  
an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring  or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again  
getting back to the point  my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because were reflecting what the public wants to know anyway  
every average person out there whos interested in this film is likely to ask  how does it compare to pulp fiction   
and so  as a critic  im already responsible to ask that same question  
jackie brown stars pam grier  the  blaxploitation  heroine from the s  who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  
tarantinos pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travoltas sudden revival in the movie industry  and with talks of an oscar nomination  the same is likely to happen for grier  
  weve made it thru comparison    jackie is a yearold airline stewardess who brings in extra cash  and probably her main revenue  by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie  pulp fictions samuel l  jackson and comparison    
ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara  robert de niro   a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years  to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars  
trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet  michael keaton  and taken into custody for possession of narcotics  as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed  
naturally this proves an obstacle to ordells plans and  not as friendly intended as wed hope  he posts jackies bail after she is put behind bars  
the thing is  ordell is in this for no one more than himself  and as we learn from his previous actions  hes willing to kill anyone who stands in the way  
jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze  
ordell wont think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as shes always done  yet at the same time  a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided  
it comes down to a simple question  would jackie rather face ordell or prison  
what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help  the law  ordell  or maybe just herself  
coming into play is another s veteran  robert forster as jackies bail bondsmen max cherry  
maxs obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system  and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance  
also involved is ordells  surfer girl  girlfriend melanie  bridget fonda   a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand  
fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role  but theres nothing more to her  and therefore  she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters  
de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself  
de niro is a brilliant actor  but a character who hardly ever speaks doesnt need a de niro to play him  
compared to pulp fiction  comparison    the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable  
in pulp fiction  even the small  seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful  complete  and lifelike  whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldnt have suffered much with a lesser talented cast  the exception being grier  
tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind  so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth  
sadly  grier too could have received a bit more attention  especially when the story is all about her newlyjarred perception of life  
jackson teams up with tarantino again  but the chemical reaction isnt as awesome as the first time  
jules was the rambling  biblequoting hitman in pulp fiction  and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off  
and although jackson is really  really good in jackie brown  i dont think hes quite as irreplaceable  
in fact  maybe a new face would have been better  
jackson couldve remained tarantinos jules  and a new guy could have become ordell  forever to remain so in our memories  
sadly  these characters are too much the same  except ordell just isnt as impressive  and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules  
another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning  
this is griers film  so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses  
it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted  but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story  
it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantinos quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style  and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonards novel  rum punch   
for those moviegoers  dont expect another pulp fiction and youll be satisfied  for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of s film making  
the directing has toned down a bit  however  yet were still reminded that this is tarantinos movie thanks to odd splitscreen storytelling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints  
so getting back to the question that i began with  this isnt pulp fiction at all  
its good  but it isnt anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place  
this is a more conservative tarantino  but not one that wont satiate true fans  
if you can realize that this isnt going to knock your socks off  then youll be happy to at least let it massage your feet  
after all  we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy
