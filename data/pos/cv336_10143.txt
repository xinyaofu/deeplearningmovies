scream  isnt quite as clever as its predecessor  but it fills the gap with a cutting wit  
death  even gruesome  bloody death  can be funny if handled the right way  some will be offended by this statement  but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example   
and  while theres plenty of horror to go around in scream   the latest s slasher flick incarnation  there are also a few laughs to be had  
scream  is a sliceanddice movie for those who dont take their horror too seriously  
the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise  
the unexpected blockbuster  whose gross soared over the  million mark during its six month release window  opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time  
a sequel was inevitable  fortunately  nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream   including director wes craven  screenwriter kevin williamson  and actors neve campbell  courtney cox  david arquette  jamie kennedy  and liev schreiber  
as stipulated by one of the  rules of sequels  uttered by a movie obsessed character in the film  the body count in scream  is higher than that in the original  
paradoxically  theres a lot less gore  
there is blood  of course  but nothing excessive by slashermovie standards  and there are no depictions of spilled entrails  
craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids  
a second strength of scream  is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cutout stereotypes lined up for slaughter  
after all  weve known some of these people for two movies  its almost impossible not to care about them at least a little  
scream  opens approximately two years after the original  
as in the first picture  theres a slick  selfmocking prologue  
this time  the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps  whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab  which is based on the  true life  events of scream   
some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films  its surely no coincidence that  in addition to pinkett and epps  scream  features two black characters   
shortly thereafter  she and her boyfriend have been gutted  signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders  
craven lets loose a burst of tongueincheek creativity for the  movie within a movie  sequences  
they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream  an act that he accomplishes with great panache  
stab features heather graham in the  casey becker  role  played in the original by drew barrymore  and tori spelling as  sidney prescott   neve campbell   
sadly  we only see a couple of scenes from stab  
it would have been a little more fun  i think  had craven used joe dantes approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production  
following the prologue  we are reintroduced to sidney prescott  who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college  
her friend randy  jamie kennedy  is a student there as well  and hes just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever  
once the double murder at stab becomes big news  the media converges on windsor  looking to interview the original victim  
at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers  courtney cox   who has a little surprise for sidney  
she has brought cotton weary  liev schreiber   the man sidney falsely accused of murder  with her  
also arriving at the college is deputy dewey  david arquette   who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations  
in addition to the survivors from the original scream  the field of potential victims is wellpopulated  
theres a blond coed named cece  sarah michelle gellar  who has now appeared in two of williamsons movies  this one and i know what you did last summer   sidneys requisite boyfriend  derek  jerry oconnell   a local newswoman  laurie metcalf   gales new cameraman  duane martin   a british drama teacher  david warner   and several sorority sisters and wouldbe sorority sisters  portia de rossi  rebecca gayheart  elise neal  marisol nichols   
ultimately  there are lots of attractive corpses  
from the stab scenes to lines like  brothers dont last long in situations like this   craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream   and the movie is enjoyable  if a little overlong  the livelier first hour is better than the second   
their resolution to the obligatory  whodunit   
is less of a letdown than it could be  and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes  
   nice twist   quips the killer  
  didnt see it coming  didya    
one senses  however  that  by the end of this picture  the overall concept of a hip  selfreferential slasher film has been played out  
supposedly  theres going to be a scream   but  if the film makers dont come up with something radical  we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill
