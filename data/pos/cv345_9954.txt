alien  is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was  years old  and i must admit that i didnt like it  
of course  i was expecting aliens again  and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien   you need to see aliens  but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james camerons aliens was an action film  and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group  but alien  is an extremely entertaining film  which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long  and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue  because the film has quite a bit of action  and the dialogue was essential and wellwritten  
as for the chase sequence  it was long  but not overly long  creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien  on video helped  
on the big screen  i was overwhelmed by something i normally didnt see  
it was a very dark film  and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
dont get me wrongim not saying films should eliminate swearing  but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks  it gets rather distracting  
however  since seeing it again  i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result  alien s only flaw  albeit a major one  is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them  and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked  and of course one was lt  ripley  sigourney weaver   although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens  charles dance   but because we like him  the inevitable occurs  
alien  begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien  is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher  who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue  unless you count computer warnings   fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments    
  title     
a shot of an alien egg    
  title     
alien legs stretch up into the air    
  title     
and so on and so on  
during these first ten minutes  i learned everything i had to in order for alien  to proceed  
its quite a remarkable opening  and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  
because of this facehugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens  the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod  and sent down to the nearest planet  fiorina fury  an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  
however  the facehugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryotubes  and is sent down with the escape pod  
unfortunately  during the landing  all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  
of course  you need a carrier for this facehugger  and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  
ripley is revived and asks to see the ship  
after seeing a mysterious acideaten section  ripley asks to see the dead bodies  and then have them cremated  
this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  
featuring a monologue from dillon  charles s  dutton   a prisoner who has found god  the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dogs demise  
its one of the most memorable moments  as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  
and this is where alien  succeeds  
fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films  and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock  in fact  he is the mixture of both   
fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it  and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  
alien  is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  
by doing so  fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  
many people have criticized finchers filming of the death scene of ripley  i reveal nothing by saying this  as looking too fake  but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch  but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron  a great deal of symbolism is derived  
i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron  
however  most people seem to want to witness ripley die  which creates a paradox  as she is the character i didnt want to see die   
why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film  and i dont plan on spoiling that in this review  
from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever  
in alien  it was  of course  the moment the alien burst out of kanes stomach  
in aliens  it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine  
alien  has several  but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley  
ripley is pushed up against a wall  and the alien stands inches away from her  
why it doesnt kill her is a shocker  which later leads to a surprise ending  
fincher apparently loves to use closeups of actors faces  michael douglas and the clown faceoff in the game in the same style   and by shaving off the actors hair  the only thing we have to look at is their faces  
many critics didnt like all the actors being bald  but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot  
most of alien  works when you take it in context of the story  but when you try to compare it to its predecessors  finchers turn seems a bit gloomy and dark  though thats not always a bad thing  
the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films  with some major twists  
again  we are setup with several different characters  and one by one  they are picked off  
however  while the first two had tons of arsenal  especially camerons film   alien  takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this rundown prison  
as a result  no weapons are to be found  
this creates a lot of tension  although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense  
as an alien film  alien  is the worst of the series  but by itself  it is an extremely wellmade motion picture  with a lot more merits than not  
the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the onedimensional characters  
i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about  
despite this  ripley was the central figure  and thats what is important  
we care for her  even though she began to act just like one of the guys  
again  the technical side of this film is remarkable  and better than the two previous versions  
while camerons version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary  fincher uses brilliant camera angles  terrific lighting  and moody sets  
the cinematography  by alex thomson  is very well done  with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie  
the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in  as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around  
the yellows  reds  and oranges of the lights create a dark mood  and by themselves create a lot of suspense  
shadows dance on the walls  and yet those shadows could easily be the alien  
the alien is different from its predecessors this time around  and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense  
the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien  racing after the characters  
the sets are quite incredible  which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien  
the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed  
the sets appear to be in the future  but not too far in the future  
one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien  nothing surprising there   
sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance  equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens  
she was snubbed at the oscars for this one  mainly because the film was a critical bomb  
her reactions are far more realistic in this film  with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter  
its quite touching really  
charles s  dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates  and i was on the brink of actually caring for him  
charles dance turns in a nice lowkey performance  and as a result  i cared for him immediately  
lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii  but he was more entertaining in aliens  
the rest of the cast is pretty stale  though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world  
alien  is rated r for strong violence and language  and sex  
although it has its flaws  alien  is highly entertaining with rich symbolism  
this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie  
while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films  fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out  
its a film like finchers which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity  the final scene   
in fact  it tells us that we  as a society  have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little  fake   
whenever something looks fake on screen  we immediately point it out as a mistake  
but perhaps it isnt a mistake
