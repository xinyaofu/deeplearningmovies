bob the happy bastards quickie review  
the matrix 
whats worse than yk  
how about a fully digital future where nothing is real  
thats what computer programmer neo  keanu reeves  slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix  a movie directed by the wachowski brothers  the guys behind the hip thriller bound   
before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role  hold on  
theres actually a story with depth here  
it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix  led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss  who looks quite cool in leather  i must say  
neo  reeves  is pretty much a key player in this fight  although he really doesnt look it at first  
could this amateur be  the one  as fisburne thinks he is  
credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build  something that few special effectsladen films seem to do these days  
theres plenty of effects to go around  of course  but at least theres a backbone to build them on as well  
reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo  particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy  yet great  
i wish the villains werent quite so  generic   leftover gmen from looking for a sweet scifi actioner with plenty of stopmotion swooping camera angles and  of course  a motherlode of a helicopter explosion  
now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project  
bring it on
