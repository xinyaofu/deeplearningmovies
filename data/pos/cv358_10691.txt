contrary to the title   the boxer  is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics  
its actually three movies in one  a political film  a boxing film  and a love story  
all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story  but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal  
weve seen it all before  and were just not blown away with it like we should be  
oh well  
its still an excellent irish story  
  the boxer  of the title is danny flynn  jim sheridan staple daniel daylewis   an exira member who gets out of a belfast prison after  years  and finds out that his troubles are far from over  
first off  the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill  brian cox   and one of its subleaders  harry  gerard mcsorley   both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail  
while this is going on  danny and his old drunkard buddie  ike  ken stott  who played the chief inspector in danny boyles  shallow grave    reopen an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects  protestant and catholics  to work together  
danny not only begins teaching kids how to box  but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison  and is ready to start boxing real people again  
and danny runs into his exlove  maggie   breaking the waves  s emily watson   who hasnt seen him since he went in  
they dont easily start up their romance again because shes the wife of a prisoner whom she married during dannys tenure in prison  and also has a son  liam  ciaran fitzgerald   from him  whom liam is hoping will get out soon  
but the two are slowly redrawn to eachother again  and this begins to complicate things  
the political story is nothing really special but works in itself  
weve seen it many a time before  but its at least interesting  sometimes emotional  and even riveting at times  
theres a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty  
the boxing story is very minor to the story  but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly  and even with good sportsmanship  
there are only a few boxing scenes  but theyre never like  raging bull  letsstripdownthesporttoitsbones brilliant  
theyre more realistic  and instead of bone crunching  we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother  which is slightly unerving at times  
and i didnt know daniel daylewis was in such good shape  
but the backbone of the story is the love one  
because these characters are given such horrible circumstances  and since the two leads have such great chemistry together  we really feel for their plight  
as the film goes on  and circumstances get worse and worse  the characters have to make real human decisions  and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters  
this is how you write a love story  take note  hollywood  
these elements are pretty much equally balanced  with each of the parts of the stories working handinhand with eachother  
i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered  and sometimes spilled over into the next  
it made sure that we didnt just care for one of them  
im not saying theyre all equally great  because the love story really carries the film  but at least they all work out respectively  
the acting is amazing  with daylewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry  
im not sure if theyre oscarnominee bound  but theyre very good  
in the supporting roles  billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers  
but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike  who is just a great scene stealer  
the direction and cowriting by jim sheridan  with the other cowriting credit going to terry george  is excellent  rounding out the characters well  but not pacing everything greatly  
i noticed that the first half was very leisurely  yet fascinating   but the second half whirls by at a quick pace  and ends much too quickly  
more time could have been spent thinking up the ending  since it does seem quite sloppy  
though  the boxer  is a good film  it never achieves the greatness that it should  
sure  its a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get  but on its own  it just could have been better  
but it still works out  gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama  and features great acting  
even if it could have been better  thisll do
