america has finally gotten what its needed for years  a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma  
regretfully its only a movie  
president james marshall  harrison ford  is fed up with terrorist activities  
teaming up with the russian government  he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek  a reactionary general ready to reunite the soviet union under his fascist reign  
during a celebration dinner  marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists  
  its your turn to be afraid   he declares  
returning home on air force one  he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally  
ultranationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov  gary oldman  hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released  
marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule  which clinton says doesnt exist in real life  but refuses  preferring to stay and fight  
director wolfgang peterson   das boot    in the line of fire    outbreak  takes the overused  die hard  theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with holdyourbreath intensity  
if you can take your eyes off the screen  steal a look at the audience  
everyone is totally engrossed  
the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it  
oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder  he does it so well  
when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead  you know that hes over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become  
you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time  
when korshonov executes passengers  there is a frightening reality to it  
the guns in this film are deadly weapons  not cartoons  
harrison ford has done one role for several years  
his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here  
marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job  
realistically  hes a man afraid  but not afraid to act  
ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero  
indiana jones in the oval office  
he and oldmans archetypes match up perfectly  
the other roles also go to accomplished actors  
glenn close as the determined but unsure vicepresident is the picture of an executive forced into a position that shes not quite ready for  
dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority   im in charge here    
is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance  
of course the politics are all wrong  
a cowboy president  even down to his name  with big guns shoots his way through problems  
much like the american collective memory of jfks camelot  the image is wondrous if you dont look too deep  
the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film  but they work here  
no matter what political spin you put on the story  the movie is an outstanding one  
i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the countrys future  not a common belief nowadays  
now if we only can get ford to run for president  
just because one actor didnt work out as chief executive doesnt mean that a different one couldnt  
  michael redman has lost count of how many years hes been writing this column   years     years  while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes
