susan grangers review of  songcatcher  in the midst of this summers fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes  there are a few thoughtful movies  and this appalachian period drama is one  
oscar nominee janet mcteer   tumbleweeds   stars as dr  lily penleric  an accomplished musicologist who  back in that prefeminist era  was refused a full professorship at her university  
determined to prove her worth  she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina  where her younger sister elna  jane adams  runs a school  
there in bear creek  she discovers a treasuretrove of traditional scotsirish and english folk ballads  given a unique interpretation by the insular locals  
excited  she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler  pat carroll  and other selfsustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders  
their music  as she puts it  is  as much a part of life here as the air you breathe   
thats the main thrust of writerdirector maggie greenwalds occasionally uneven cultureclash story  which is loosely based on olive dame campbells foray through the blue ridge mountains in   but theres also some melodramatic romantic spice  
ornery  bearded  banjopicking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque  passionate  songcatcher   while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague  e  
katherine kerr   
im ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris  iris dement  taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteers wideeyed prot  g   
rated pg  theres an intense scene of primitive childbirth  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    songcatcher  is an intelligent  extraordinary   transported by the transcendent power of song
