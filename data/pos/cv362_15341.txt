elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mids  
it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings  
internally  the catholics wage war against the protestants  
meanwhile  spain  scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power  
little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth  cate blanchett  will be their greatest hope for survival  
the film charts elizabeths tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom  
as a protestant  she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen  
but her halfsister queen mary  kathy burke   deathly ill and unable to conceive a child  pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne  
mary gives her her blessing on only one condition  that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land  
once declared queen  elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault  both by her own subjects  including the duke of norfolk  played with steelyeyed grace by christopher eccleston  and by forces abroad  
slowly but surely  the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom  
elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers  
her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham  geoffrey rush  in a perfectly subtle performance   
also on her side is sir william cecil  sir richard attenborough   her wellmeaning but misguided chief adviser  
with few people she can trust  elizabeth must prove her selfworth any way she can  even if it means being the ironfisted ruler she secretly despises  
blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth  
she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky selfconsciousness and shrewd charisma  
though not a classical beauty  blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk  
she is at home with her characters playful tendencies  particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley  joseph fiennes   
whether fending off unctuous suitors or  playing  the houses in court  blanchetts elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike  
almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapurs visual delights  
he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes  
rolling green hills  extravagant ceremonial galas  dark and foreboding corridors  all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation  
the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here  
though writer michael hirsts script gets a little murky at times  and his injections of humor get a little overplayed  elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing  
as a whole  the story survives because elizabeths struggle is one which deserves attention  
by the time she makes her shocking  but very sensible  final declaration  were ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen
