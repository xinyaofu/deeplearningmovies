making his directorial debut  actor jon favreau brings along his swingers costar  vince vaughn  for this tale of two mugs on a career trajectory to nowheresville  
favreau  who also wrote the script  is bobby  vaughn is ricky  
by day they are construction workers  
they also are wannabe contenders  but neither has had much success  
their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw  leaving bobbys record at   
these two l  a  notsowise guys also work for max  peter falk   a midlevel mobster  who is patient and understanding with bobby  but who hates rickys guts  
max has an easy job for bobby  fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz  a smooth and silky sean combs   
bobby  because of his lifelong friendship with ricky  pleads with max to give his pal another chance and let him tag along to the big apple  
against his better judgment  max agrees  
of course ricky  a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks  nearly screws up everything  
while bobby tries to stay calm and professional  ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano  
the constrast in styles and the chemistry between favreau and vaughn is what makes made so enjoyable to watch  
favreau with his hounddog face and slowburn personality could be a modernday oliver hardy  only much wiser  
vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle  he just keeps yakking and yakking  unaware of the havoc he creates  
yet despite bobbys constant aggravation and agitation with his partner  a bond of affection and loyalty binds them  
the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch  
bobby is buttondowned  tightlywound  always waiting for the next shoe courtesy of ricky  to drop  
ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates and is genuinely surprised when he comes under attack for his faux paus  
in new york  the two lackeys are like fish out of water  stumbling from one situation to another  trying to keep alive  
combs is elegant  cool and lowkey menacing as the gangsta they are sent to meet  
falk is amusing in his small role  while famke janssen nearly breaks your heart as bobbys lowlife girlfriend  
more than anything  made is a movie with heart  
it is loud  obnoxious and very talkative  
but the cameraderie between bobby and ricky holds the key to its interest  
favreau does a commendable job in his directorial debut  
he is a player to be watched as he can only improve with experience
