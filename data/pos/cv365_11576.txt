for example  in happy gilmore  sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a selfconfident jerk of a pro  
if the star were any other comic  that would be enough motivation to drive the movie  but with sandler  the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house  
that extra motive doesnt make happy gilmore a funnier movie  
it doesnt really add any genuine emotional depth  either  
in fact  the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie  
but sandlers philosophy seems to be  if its a token gesture  why not make it a nice gesture  
that is endlessly refreshing  
in the wedding singer  sandler is right on track  
the fact that hes a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story  
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important  
david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm  
he could make fun of the fat  ugly  or embarrassing people he meets at weddings  and the story would be intact  
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character  
he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family  
robbie hart  sandler  doesnt just sing at weddings  he also gets the loners to join in and have fun  and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing  
he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding  
the day comes when robbie has his own wedding  and he is stood up by his heavymetal bride  the movie is set in    
robbie takes it hard  
he doesnt sleep  he doesnt eat  and he gets punched out at work when he sings  love stinks  at a wedding  
julia  drew barrymore   who waitresses all the weddings in town  gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to  
eventually  robbie starts rebounding toward julia  
he really likes her  but shes engaged  
her fianc  is a selfconfident jerk  do i see a trend  nope  just a formula  who doesnt deserve her  but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand  
julia seems to like robbie too  but she cant leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc  for the offchance that robbie might be serious about her  
you know the story  
youve seen it a million times before  
theres always a new way to tell it  with new lovers  new chemistry  and new details  but its the same story  
and sometimes  it works  
the wedding singer works  
first of all  the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective  
actually  its not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each ones own romantic tension  
sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man  struck with an unattainable love  
barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with  
sparks dont fly when they kiss  but they both seem right for each other  
second  their love is mature  
they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction  theyre a cute couple  but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material  
instead  they are both looking for someone meaningful  someone to settle down with  someone to grow old with  
at a wedding  robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by  
the repulsing situation is taken in stride  as if the two were already parents  caring for their sick child  
the  s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie  
other critics liked this movie in part because of the s soundtrack  
i liked it in spite of the soundtrack  
often  the music and references felt forced  
for example  robbie tells his exfianc  to  get out of my van halen tshirt before you jinx the band and they break up   
  ha ha ha  
get it  
david lee roth did leave van halen   
or how about when sammy  allen covert   robbies chauffeur friend  shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and  get this  a single silver glove  
  thats exactly what mj used to wear all the time    
unfortunately  making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding  
thats not to say the movie isnt funny  
screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before  billy madison and happy gilmore   and the two make a good combination  
herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straightfaced  smartaleck style  
lets hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over  
with barrymores charm and sandlers heart  it was hard to go wrong
