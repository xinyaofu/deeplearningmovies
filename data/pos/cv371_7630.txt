mamoru oshii is a name that probably isnt very wellknown to most american audiences  but perhaps it should be  
oshii was the director of last years bestknown japanese animated film import  ghost in the shell  and is known among fans of japanese animation  or anime  for making films with a deep philosophical bent  
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series  
in its many incarnationsgraphic novels   manga    two different runs of madeforvideo episodes  original animation videos  or oavs for short   and a television series running to nearly fifty episodespatlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan  
set in the very near future  though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived   this atypical giant robot anime features the characters  rather than the machinery  as the primary focus  
as a whole  patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan  
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains  giant industrial robots  known as  labors   an interesting play on words  considering that  robot  is derived from the czech word for labor   have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century  
with the rise of labors  however  has come a new menacelabor crime  
this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions  using patrol labors to fight labor crime  
the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division  sv  who  through no fault of their own  have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness  
sometimes utterly hilarious  sometimes almost deadly serious  the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers  and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life  
those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie  although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers  
the story  as has much of patlabor before  centers around the controversial babylon project  a gigantic seawall that will  on its completion  allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay  
this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists  most notably the house of sea organization  
however  the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist  but from someone who is already dead    
shinohara heavy industries  the premier labor manufacturer in japan  if not the whole world   has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors movement speed and efficiency by   
this hyper operating system  hos for short  has very quickly been installed into well over  of the nations labors    including the patrol labors of sv  
since that installation  dozens of labors  including a heavilyarmed military model  have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason    and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos  
  some wags have compared this to windows    
its up to asuma shinohara  labor command officer with sv and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries  to find the source of these problems before more laborsincluding svs ownfall victim to them  and before hos drags his fathers company down with it  
as was the case with ghost in the shell  if you just want a nobrainer actionfest  this might not be the movie for you  
patlabor  the movie is more of a psychological thriller  a technological suspense drama  
it is closer  perhaps  to a chrichton novel than to an action movie  crichton novels that have been made into action movies notwithstanding   
there are long  thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo  similar to sequences from ghost in the shell  
this movie is fraught with symbolismin fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism  
patlabors nearfuture setting is  aside from the giant robots tromping around  very similar to our own present day  
the film uses this setting to make its central point  is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up  
are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new  
this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabors alternate setting  
as far as the technical aspects of the film go  referring to the subtitled version  as thats the only one ive seen   the film transfer is clear  almost phenomenally so  
the animation quality is incredible  though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to  
the oavs and tv series were more cheerful  bettersuited to humor  the movie  however  makes everyone look a great deal less cute  and emphasizes that this is going to be  for the most part  a deadly serious storyline  
as far as cinematography goes  there are many interesting moments in patlabor  the movie  
i dont think i can recall ever seeing a fisheye perspective used in any other animated film  save for ghost in the shell  another oshii film   or indeed  in many other movies at all  
the cinematography is wellsuited to the storyline  emphasizing what it needs to  though a couple of scenes  where characters features are exaggerated in anger  may seem slightly strange to western audiences  
the audio track of patlabor  the movie is in glorious hifi stereo  and should be used to demonstrate home theater systemsit is that good  
even without headphones  sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to come from that side  
giant robot footsteps are deep and booming  
the sometimesunderstated  sometimesblaring score is crisp and clear  and always right on the mark  enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery  
as far as the subtitles go  i have to say that theyre among the most easilyreadable subtitles ive ever seen for anything  
large enough that they dont strain the eyes  but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen  
although it does have several action sequences in it  most notably the climactic conclusion  patlabor is foremost not an action movie  
although it is a superblyrealized film  it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story  and that could detract from some peoples enjoyment
