ok  i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start  
a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents  
with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure  
yuck  
but its not really too bad  
it has a lot working against it  for me at least  
in addition to the above  it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified madefortv movie  but longer and with bigger stars  and you have to pay to see it  
it does win you over  though  even if it is painfully predictable  
just think about it  two single parents  with their cute kids  are thrown together due to a missed field trip  
through a day of near disasters  they cont inually meet  get in one anothers way  cause trouble for one another  and generally insult one another at every opportunity  
in fact  they hate each other so much that we know that they are  or soon will be  in love  
the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples  
so this film is predictable  just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable  and the screwball genre is obviously hoffmans model for this film   
will they get fired from their yuppie jobs  
will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids  
will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her exhusband  a drummer for bruce springsteen  really is  arent they all    
will they finally kiss  
well  what do you expect  
but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled  especially when it is done with as much humour  along with a lack of sticky sentimentality  as it is in this film  
pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming  and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show  
one word of caution  though  
this film is being billed in some places as a  family  movie  
dont let that stop you  
however  i think most kids  especially boys  would be pretty bored by this move  
after all  nobody gets killed and there are no explosions  
all in all  a good  nonoffensive date movie  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv broadcast  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
