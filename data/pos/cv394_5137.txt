defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writerdirector albert brooks  who also stars in the comedy  
after dying in a car crash  on his birthday of all days  brooks wakes up in judgement city  a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings  
brooks has five days to convince two judges that hes worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence  
enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant  
during his  trial   brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen  and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant  
its impossible to resist chuckling  and cringing  at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth  
torn  in particular  is in vintage comic form  and he walks away with the picture  
the movie also features meryl streep  appealing as the loveinterest  and shirley maclaine  who pops up in a hilarious cameo  
while the film is uneven  many of its gags are price less  
take  for example  the food in judgement city  its always the most delicious youve ever tasted    
and its also caloriefreeso chow down
