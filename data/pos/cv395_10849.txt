jake kasdan  son of one of the best screenwriters around  breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hardtocategorize detective story  part mystery  part comedy  part character study and part romance  
for the most part  kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  
daryl zero  bill pullman  is a modern day sherlock holmes  
the parallel is present down to his love of music  though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin   and his addiction to drugs  amphetamines  rather than morphine   
he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces  the case about the man who lied about his age  or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  
however zeros observance of the fine art of detachment  though it makes him a brilliant private investigator  makes him somewhat of a selfimposed outcast in society  
he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson  i mean steve arlo  ben stiller   
arlo is not happy with his job  
he is thrilled to be around zeros brilliance  but his bizarre behavior  and strange requests  are frustrating to the former lawyer  
and theyre even more so to his girlfriend  jess  angela featherstone   who is fed up that her boyfriends boss means more to arlo than her  
this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  
gregory stark  ryan oneill  hires zero to find his lost keys  
it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring  and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  
now  stark is being blackmailed  and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  
to solve this case  zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  
however  this is when he is vulnerable    and 
this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic  gloria sullivan  kim dickens   who may be involved in the blackmail scheme  
for the first time  zero has to question his own objectivity  as he finds his client less and less sympathetic  
zero effect is weakest in its obviously  wacky  scenes depicting daryl zeros odd behavior  
such scenes might be appropriate in an outandout satire  making zero an ace venturaish character  
however  theres a much meatier movie in here    it just takes a while to get out  
thats not to say that theres not a place for humor in this film  
in fact  some of the best scenes are ben stillers wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer  
however  the overthetop scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film  and they arent funny enough to stand on their own  
once the investigation is underway  however  zeros brilliance really begins to shine  
his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlocks own  
as the mystery begins to unfold  zeros deductions lead the plot in interesting directions  but never lose the viewer  
zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well  
zeros relationship with gloria is lowkey  but it hits all the right notes  
however  we are always kept distant from glorias character  
shes given plenty of development  but we never understand what she is thinking  
perhaps that may be intentional  to place the audience in zeros zone of detachment  
but  on the whole  it is frustrating  
bill pullman  when hes not spacing out  creates a vibrant character in daryl zero  
theres one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years  and it is shockingly moving    expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character  but one which fits in well  
and  although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called  zero  seriously  it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name  
although zero effect is a bit awkward in places  it is a strong debut for kasdan  and shows great promise
