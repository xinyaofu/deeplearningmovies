in   director brett ratner and his stars  jackie chan and chris tucker  breathed new life into the buddyaction film genre with the crosscultural  rush hour   to the tune of about  million  
you dont mess with success  so the team is back again  and better  in  rush hour    
the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the nonstop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in  rush hour  that played well to audiences around the world  
the formula worked so well  in fact  that the sequel was inevitable  
im never thrilled with the idea of a followup to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations  
surprisingly   rush hour   wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it  
the script  by jeff nathanson  utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film   wastes no time getting to the point right from the start  
terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong  killing two american translators  and chief inspector lee  jackie chan  is handed the job of solving the crime  
concurrently  his friend james carter  chris tucker  arrives on the island for some much needed rr and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights  
instead  lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars  
the makers of  rush hour   are working at a distinct advantage over the original  
we  the viewer  are familiar with the two lead characters and the alreadyexisting chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around  
that chemistry was a high point  and probably the saving point  before and  now  the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit  
little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in  rush hour   
first and foremost to me  in  rh   is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chans artistry in fight choreography  
the year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and  here  he does not disappoint  
chans use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand  such as a trash bucket  
his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding  on the tail end of a yacht  in a hong kong massage parlor and  for the finale  in a las vegas casino  
like harold lloyd or buster keaton  chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch  
chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop  carter  who teams  again  with lee to put down the bad guys  
when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case  he still looks to have some fun  
when lee goes into a karaoke bar  the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan  john lone  and his hoods  carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff  
the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and  with jackie chan  has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills  
the combo of chans flying feet and fists with tuckers fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the  lethal weapon  films  
the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently  
john lone  as ricky tan  is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign  alan king in a walk through performance   
lone doesnt chew scenery or make pronouncements to  get lee and carter   but gives the chief bad guy elegance  
zhang ziyi   crouching tiger  hidden dragon   continues to display her martial arts skills as rickys taciturn henchlady  hu li  who carries on an ongoing battle with carter  
  carter has a problem  through most of the film  with hitting a woman  but this falls aside with their eventual oneonone melee at the conclusion   
roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous  and resembles sandra bullock  as undercover agent isabella molina  she doesnt add much to the equation but is terrific to watch  
director ratner and the original  rush hour  production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera  
cinematographer matthew f  leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives  rh  the fluid camera movement the genre film needs  
production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look  whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino  
the rest of the techs are of the same high quality  
im surprised to even say that  rush hour   is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies  
it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun  frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out  so far  this summer  
i give it a b
