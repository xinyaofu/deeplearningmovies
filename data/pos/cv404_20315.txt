in   the muse  albert brooks plays steven phillips  a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio  
they claim that hes lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them  
he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over  
so he turns to his  best  friend  jack  jeff bridges  another screenwriter whos enjoyed success after success  
on the way over to jacks house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman  sharon stone  into a cab and begins to think  is he having an affair  
when confronted  jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is  in fact  a muse  a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity  and has helped him garner his success  
  she doesnt do any actual writing   he is told   but inspires you   
steven is excited by what hes hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if shell take steven on as a new client  
jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present  preferably something from tiffanys  
after the meeting the muse  sarah decides to take on steven  but at a price  she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her  like bringing her salads in the middle of the night   
stevens wife  andy macdowell  sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon  
steven confesses everything and  although at first suspicious  she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life  
the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble hes going through for her  
and thats a question only time will tell  
  the muse  is albert brooks sixth film as writerdirectoractor  he cowrote with monica johnson  and although its a good movie its not up to the level of his best works   defending your life  and  mother    
the problem lies in the script  and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor  there arent nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good oneliners  
it has a great premise but doesnt deliver up to its full potential  
but  i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit  
he may whine and complain  but he just wants to support his family and be happy  
and i like sharon stone in this movie too  its a nice change of pace for her  
and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner  james cameron and martin scorsese  
and although  the muse  doesnt have as much to say about hollywood as robert altmans  the player  i still left the theater feeling good  
and thats something i wish i got out of more movies
