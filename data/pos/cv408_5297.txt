it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mstk  tm  
he had never seen any episodes of the show  and i have watched a scant few  due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes  
for those of you not familiar with the premise  dr clayton forrester  beaulieu  wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public  
to achieve this  he  in the words of the tv series theme  which is missing in the movie   bumped mike nelson  nelson   on the noggin and then shot him into space   and is monitoring nelsons reactions to the movies he is forced to endure  
rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies  nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions  tom servo and crow t  robot  
the format of the show consists of nelson  servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched  and breaks every  minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love  the ship on which our heroes are marooned  
only two things are different in the movie  the absence of forresters sidekick  tvs frank  and the slower pace of the jokes  
this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke  
for their big screen outing  the producers have chosen  this island earth   a  classic  and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill  
unfortunately for that film  but making it ideal mstk fodder   acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which  by todays standards  are less than impressive  
nelson  co  make jokes about everything from japans dominance in the world market  to star trek  to the state of disrepair of seattles kingdome  and most of them work  
unfortunately  the segments set outside the satellites movie theater seem out of place and arent particularly funny  but at least theyre fairly short  
the big question about this movie though is  why  
i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series  rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago   but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen  there are no special effects to dazzle you  no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat  and no use of digital surround sound  
so  it seems pointless to spend  per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for   and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts  
nevertheless  mstk  tm provides more laughoutloud opportunities than any film youre going to see this year  and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse  
given its uniqueness  i hesitate to grade it against other films  but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of  unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad bmovies  it does well
