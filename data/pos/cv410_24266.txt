george little  jonathan lipnicki  wants a little brother  
after mr  and mrs  little  hugh laurie and geena davis  visit the orphange  they decide to adopt stuart  a talking mouse  voiced by michael j  fox   
george isnt so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house  and neither is snowbell the family cat  voiced by nathan lane   
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race  but snowbell wants stuart out of the house  hes unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying its ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat   
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery  cgi   
the character of stuart  while obviously a computer generated image  grows on you as the film progresses and youll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect  
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film  as many of the  supporting cast  are actual cats  with computer animated mouths so they can speak   
its fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with  
stuart little is a charming family film  
there are some great laughs in the movie  with a script cowritten by the sixth senses m  night shyamalan no less    
some moments that can only be described as  too cute   the boat race sequence is what won me over  and even the majority of the oneliners  common nowadays in childrens films or films featuring nathan lane  are tolerable  
kids and parents will love this one  
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video  
there are two different dvds on sale  one contains the film in full frame  and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of       
both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital    audio  
both versions also contain the following extras  and hang in there with me here    theres a lot of them   a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson  a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors  an isolated score track  an interactive trivia game  an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film  a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo  and a stuart little readalong story  which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you   
there are also three music videos  and six theatrical trailers  called thecatrical trailers    
get it  
its funny   for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases  the adventures of elmo in grouchland  madeline  the nuttiest nutcracker  muppets from space  and baby geniuses  the only bad thing about this entire dvd    
i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses   
dvdrom features are also on the disc  including web links and a demo of the stuart little cdrom game  
but wait    
theres still more  
theres a section called  basement treasures  where you will find the auditions of the films animators  six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director  a visual effects gag reel  a production gag reel  and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene  with commentary from the director   
the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson  
they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the films production  
minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script  namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski  who wrote the people vs  larry flynt and ed wood  and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel  who wrote splash and multiplicity  among others   
anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur  
the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film  
movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track  serious animation buffs will love the second one  
now i know this is slightly off topic  but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now  
one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called  i need to know  by a group called r angels  
this video features four midteenage girls  the singers obviously  having a slumber party  
the girls ask a ouija board  i need to know    
who to do  who to do  who to do  as the song begins  
they then sneak out of their house  and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits  
then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like  ill be your pleasure all the time    
just say the words that youll be mine   
um    
what the hell  
what does this have to do with stuart little  
how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie  let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd  
when the video concludes  the words  to be continued  appear  
oh i cant wait to see who theyve slept with when the toy story  dvd comes out  
kids wont care about most of the special features on this dvd  but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a  kid at heart  thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them  
this is the way to do dvd  a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost  
the diney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar
