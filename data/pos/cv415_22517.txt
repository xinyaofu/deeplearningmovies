in   walt disney released a filmed experiment  
fantasia was a blend of two art forms  classical music and animation  
while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day  it has since become recognized as something of a classic  
according to the program notes  it was mr  disneys intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress  
sixty years later  thanks to the ongoing efforts of walts nephew  a new fantasia is being released  
it was not only worth the waiting  it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past halfdecade  
with seven new sequences and one old favorite  fantasia  exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films  
like the original  fantasia  will more than likely bore the very young  although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter  perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studios primary audience  
ranging from the silly to the sublime  each segment is preceded by a short  humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host  steve martin  bowfinger  being the first and most effective  
these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which  along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators  is thoughtfully and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis  
fantasia  is being released exclusively in the giantscreened imax theaters  making for a unique viewing experience  
there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone and surely  people will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites  
for me  that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected and discontented people living in nyc who  unknowingly  help each other realize their dreams  
drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld and inspired by george gershwins rhapsody in blue  the music and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts  
children will like the short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saintsaens  
here  a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yoyo playing antics  
they will also giggle as donald duck  playing noahs assistant  tries to load the animals into the ark to the familiar strains of pomp and circumstance by sir edward elgar  
  while the depiction is not biblically accurate  it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis    
a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended  
there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighis pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of natures cycle of life  death  and rebirth in igor stravinskys firebird suite  
but the stories they tell are uplifting  containing nothing too frightening for our younger children  
the darkest segment  spiritually speaking  actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia  mickey mouse in the sorcerers apprentice by paul dukas  
but overall  the emotions evoked from fantasia  are positive ones  being full of hope and promise  
music has an impact which can be undeniably felt  capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums  
it is no wonder that the levites  as the priestly tribe of the old testament  were also the appointed musicians  
if fantasia  is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts  it will have done an incredible service
