with a team of  graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresofts square pictures  final fantasy  inspired by the topselling game franchise  is visually aweinspiring and groundbreaking  
no doubt  you have never seen anything like this film  and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved  
but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story  wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting  
obviously  the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi  
everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail  individual threads in the fabric  individual strands of hair swaying  wrinkles and pimples on skin  incredible water effects  
overall  the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue  and the times when they dont sync perfectly really stand out  since the animation is usually so dazzling  
but you wont spend much time dwelling on those gaffes  as soon as you catch one  the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering   wow     
like the series of games  final fantasys plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors  outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind  hironobu sakaguchi  
its the year   and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien  phantoms   
whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors  the ofteninvisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul  for some unexplainable reason   
while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein  james woods  to blast the aliens with a  zeus cannon   dr  aki ross  mingna  and dr  sid  donald sutherland  plan to build a  wave  using eight collected  spirits  to counteract the phantoms and kill them off  
while the images serve the scifi aspect of the film well  the storytelling doesnt  
its unfortunate  because the plot seems so intricately thought out  
perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script  
some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english  except two americans wrote the screenplay  
nevertheless  the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes  
why do these aliens feed on souls  
if they can pass through bodies and ships  how can humans hurt them with guns  
what is so special about the  spirits  that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens  
worse yet  the dialogue is scripted to be either like a scienceheavy star trek episode  an installment of die hard  or a sappy love story  depending on whos doing the talking  
for the most part  its bearable considering the genre  but tedious speeches and cheesy lines dont do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes  
the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming  who always has great cracks during tense moments  
but  when the lights come up and the credits roll  youre more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked  
theres no question that the roughly  million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie  and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film  
youd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more
