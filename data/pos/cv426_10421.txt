by now i figured id seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a halfdozen times  not that im complaining  
to call him the  master of suspense  is an understatement  
the paradine case     admittedly one of hitchcocks lesser movies  turned out to be one id missed  
this one  like all hitchcock films  is well worth savoring  
the story opens with the rich mrs  maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband  
as mrs  paradine  alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world  
to franz waxmans stark and moody music  we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels  
stripped of her fine raiment  she becomes a commoner again  which  as it turns out  was what she was before she met her husband  
  a brief skirmish  and youll be lunching at the savoy again   anthony keane  her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting  predicting a fast and easy trial  
gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister  
  shes no murderess   he argues simplistically  smitten by her beauty  
  shes too fine a woman   
his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife  gay  ann todd   
unlike most hitchcock movies  which are centered on the thriller and the mystery  this one is more a romantic melodrama  
typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light  
she deflects her husbands affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client  
the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs  paradines portrait nearby  
in the relatively unsatisfying first half  little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires  
to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs  paradine acquitted because  if mrs  paradine dies  his heart will go with her  
if she is freed  he will be able to forget her  
as part of the soap opera  a mysterious louis jordan plays mr  paradines valet  who has had some not to be discussed relationships  
charles coburn plays anthonys legal partner  sir simon flaquer  
and charles laughton  who looks like coburn  is judge lord horfield  
this being proper british society  they will all dine together at the judges house not long before the case begins  
court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences  some subtle and others not  between the american and the british judicial systems  
one  for example  of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying  
one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations  
as the judges wife  lady sophie horfield  ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress  the films only nomination  for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit  
  so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walkon  
at  minutes into the film  he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case  
dont miss it   
in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom  
the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first  
watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trials action  
as anthony explains it  the simple case has only  possibilities  mr  paradine poisoned himself  mrs  paradine did it  or the valet did it  
the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid  
the paradine case runs     
the picture is in black and white  
it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested
