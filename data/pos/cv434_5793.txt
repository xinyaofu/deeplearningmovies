  unlike earthquakes  their fury is precise  
unlike hurricanes  their reach is unlimited  
unlike fires  there is no way to combat them

 excerpt from twister production notes 
im sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes  or twisters  before  
i for one  have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally  i feel tornadocaused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes         that is until i saw twister  
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise  not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable  
it will suck in cars  houses  livestock  etc      
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister  youll get to see all this  close up  
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers  
these people are basically outoftheirmind and for the sake of obtaining data on twisteroccurrences  they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes  trying to get as close as they can      that 
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them  
jo  helen hunt  is the leader of this pack of kamikazes  
while they are gearing up for the motherofallstorms as predicted by satellite recon  bill  bill paxton   a former co leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo  
apparently  bill has left his rogueish days for greener and more practical pastures  as a television weatherman  
he catches up with his oldself and follows the pack like the good ole days  bringing his wifetobe melissa  jamie gertz  along  a citybred woman toting around with a handphone  
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurements of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable earlywarning system can be implemented  
the problem is  the device has to be placed very near the twister  and in its path  which is practically unpredictable  of destruction in order for it to function  
to add to their current challenge  there is another group of storm chasers that is corporationfunded led by jonas  cary elwes  and they too have a similar device  
thus begins the race  jos cheap government equipment with beatenup vehicles against jonass hightech computers and satellite linkups with their sleek  black allterrain vans  
plot wise  there are not really anything to shout about  
twister is as predictable as any summer boxoffice hit can get  
there is the danger of the twister  the competition with jonasos more welloff team and of course  the settling of differences between jo and bill  this part gives the film its human substance   
helen hunt  bill paxton and the rest of the actorsactresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie  the twister itself  
thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm  lucasfilms industrial light and magic   we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close  from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock  
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility  thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films  for action sequences  
like his previous film speed  the tornado sequences  which are essentially the action sequences  are well visualised and edited  
audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen  
the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister  
  the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this  twister is definitely an effectdependent movie  
now that id fever has begun to reside  and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop ets ass for the umpteenth time       twister is your sure bet of  bucks well spent  
watch it in a good theatre    please  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
