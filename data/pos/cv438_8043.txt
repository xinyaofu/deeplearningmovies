  seven  is one of the best mystery movies ive ever seen  
its extremely intriguing and suspenseful  but its also quite fun  
its a serial killer mystery  but you dont care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer  
the story is a copsonthetrailofserialkiller mystery  
someone is murdering people who are offenders of  the seven deadly sins   
a fat man  gluttony  was forced to eat himself to death  a lawyer  greed  is slaughtered by his own rich possessions    
i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much  
what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the  good guys  which makes the unseen villain seem so vile  
brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills  the cocky rookie  
however  morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset  the wise veteran on the verge of retirement  and he doesnt get killed by the end   
there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief  
this is impressive because the mood is so tense  and the fact that it can be downplayed as well as it is here  let alone at all  is quite an accomplishment  
the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil  scary place many believe it to be  
the production design is superb  in the spirit of  batman  and  the crow   this film embodies the gothic mood  
the way the words fade in and out  along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level  even the credits are scary  
the killers victims have no connections at all  and thus mills and sommerset dont have much to go on to solve the case  
they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense  
we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown  
not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this  
the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect  
lets just say it seems a little too  mystery movie   or too convenient in other words  
when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe  a terrific chase scene ensues  
this is a typical thrilling element  but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story  
if anything  this film is the epitome of twist endings  
i dont have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal  but the way in which this happens is surprising  
there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives  and even though hes obviously insane  his charisma makes for some good points  
whats even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the films resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is  
  seven  is not just a film about crime  but about the evil within man  
john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of  scum   
but as justified as he makes himself seem  we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice
