call me crazy  but i dont see saving private ryan as the film of the summer  
a good movie  yes  with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare  
an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielbergs best work  no  
personally  if i was spielberg  i wouldnt go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindlers list and the indiana jones movies  
im guessing steve has a thing for nazis  i really wouldnt be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastikawearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie  
all lofty pretenses aside  saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a s slasher flick  
the difference is  its easy during friday the th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacons chest while blood spurts like crazy  but its damn hard to sit and eat reeses pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield  
and believe me  theres plenty of it  
a minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain  tom hanks  and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire  
lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on  and all the young men in the audience find themselves never  ever wanting to be drafted  
cut to some bureaucratic defense office  where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties  
one woman happens upon an interesting detail  three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat  and their mother is getting the telegram today  
i guess its an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother  so the army chief  harve presnell  sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission  to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home  
that way  the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs  ryan  
one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know its a mission designed to make the army look good  
they question the worth of risking eight soldiers lives to save one  and hanks character admits he doesnt give a damn about ryan  hes just following orders  
if this was a john wayne movie  things would be different  
thered be a phony   lets go get that boy  gosh darn it   
attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war  
by doing things this way  spielberg admits the instincts of self preservation and complacency that every normal person has  
it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosteronedriven stallone movie mission  
the movies pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semiintrospective conversation among the soldiers  
hanks is painted first as a nailstough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men  
its not that way for long  
edward burns  the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isnt available  is the impulsive one  
jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time  and so on  
none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes  but was spielbergs obvious intention  
i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long  how were they going to fill three hours time searching for one person and still make it interesting  
there are a few false starts  hanks finds one private ryan in ted dansons company  apparently  danson joined the army after  ink  was canceled   and breaks the bad news before learning its the wrong ryan  
and of course the movies far from over when hanks does locate ryan  matt damon  the other guy you get when affleck isnt available   
thats when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick  although body parts and limbs still fly like never before  
saving private ryan is worth your time  but its definitely no schindlers list  
the battle scenes are intense and realistic  but some of the attempts at sincere emotion arent  
the movies bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place  when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out  whining   tell me ive led a good life  
tell me im a good man   
spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any threehour movie about the past should be framed by a selfcontained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present  
much more effective are subtler scenes  like the one where several of hanks men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers  and they make light of what theyre doing by pretending theyre playing poker  
this while an airborne division marches by  their eyes full of that mound of dogtags  
by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war  the audience gets the message  
and even if its not a classic  saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there
