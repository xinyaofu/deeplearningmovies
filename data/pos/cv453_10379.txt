i was pleasantly surprised by this film  
with a budget topping  million  i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth centurys greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see  
how much could you dress up the sets  
how many models and computer effects could you use  
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks  
oh  if ive just given away part of the plot for you  go back to school  
after having viewed titanic  however  i found it to be a wellpaced  welldesigned  and overall wellmade movie  
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic  but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best ive seen  
titanic tells its story in two time periods  
it starts out in the present  when ocean explorer brock lovett  bill paxton  and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic  searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship  
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace  which is broadcast on the news  
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett  who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas  
there she tells her story to lovett and his team  
in   rose dewitt bukater  kate winslett   a young lady belonging to societys upper class  boards the titanic for the ships first atlantic crossing  from southampton  england to new york  
she is engaged to cal hockley  billy zane   an heir to old money  and a snob in every sense of the word  
on board  rose feels the stifling trappings of highsocietys expectations  and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanics stern  but is saved from her selfproclaimed fate by jack dawson  leonardo dicaprio   a passenger in thirdclass   steerage   as its referred to   who talks her out of jumping  
although for rose the attraction is not immediate  a love affair soon develops between the two  which endangers roses social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal  
the story sounds very simple  and perhaps even unexciting  but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron  a good movie comes through  
dicaprio is marvelous as the young  but worldlywise jack  playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors  
his is a character that is immediately likable  as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations  
girls are going to swoon over him  
winslet also proves herself a good actress  delivering her lines convincingly  and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable  
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her characters upbringing  
simply by judgment of her gait  i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an uppercrust debutante  
rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess  she sometimes looks positively clumsy  and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting  
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal  since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him  
his features are such that even when he smiles  theres something mistrustful about him  and when he scowls  he is evil incarnate  
hes something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher  but a cheaper model  
like dicaprio and winslet  zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well  
backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy  cals personal assistant  or  man  as they said at the turn of the century   
no matter who else is in the cast  you can always count on a good performance by warner  who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match  
additionally  there are a number of smaller fictional and nonfictional roles thrown in for color  such as kathy bates as  the unsinkable  molly brown  danny nucci as jacks friend fabrizio de rossi  eric braeden as john jacob astor  and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie  
nice to see dr  bombay getting work  
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die  
this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic  but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ships crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the firstclass passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else  
in this way  titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures  
you dont just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop  but a very real account of class struggle as well  
as i mentioned before  the budget for this film was tremendous  and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects  
the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail  and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic  
with regard to the exteriors  i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale  
cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank  but only had room for   and therefore had to computergenerate the remaining  feet  
couldve fooled me and everyone else in the theater  as the splicing is seamless  
also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning  
we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship  how the flooding occurred  the way the ship sank  and why it did so in that manner  
these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening  and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction  in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion  
in all  james camerons titanic is a good blend of love story  history  and action  
the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewers attention is held alternately by those three main elements  from the movies intriguing beginning to its satisfactory ending  
in box office receipts  titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship
