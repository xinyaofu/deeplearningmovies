it was easy to fear the worst  
begin with a classic s television series  add a big budget and an alist star in the lead role  and stir  
script  you ask  
who needs one  kid    
weve got ourselves a formula  
that was my fear  a bloated monster without any sense of direction  
then  much to my amazement  everything that could possibly go wrong    
didnt  
the fugitive is as lean  taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years  
under the direction of andrew davis  s under siege   the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go  
expect box office to go through the roof  deservedly  and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones  
the premise is a simple one  
dr  richard kimble  harrison ford  is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer  a man with an artificial arm  
after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry  kimble finds himself on the run  
his one goal  to find the onearmed man  andreas katsulas  before u  s  marshall sam gerard  tommy lee jones  finds him  
where the fugitive surprises the most is the script  by jeb stuart and david twohy  
in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic  the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence  its attention to detail and its respect for the audience  
in an early sequence  kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard  slick back his hair and change into a lab coat  
on his way out  a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesnt know is kimble to zip up his pants  
its a small moment  but it punches home the urgency of kimbles situation  and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget  
later  while trying to lose himself in a parade  kimble thinks to drop his overcoat  the most likely way hed be recognized from behind  
its these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimbles tells gerard that hes too smart to be caught  he may just be right  
credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators  
the bus crash which allows kimbles escape is a spectacular sequence  as is a leap from a dam into the water below  
the action is crisp and brutal  and never romanticized  
special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the singlemindedness of the two leads  
and what a pair of performances those leads are  
tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard  because he manages an incredibly challenging feat  
for the first third of the film  there is really no  villain  per se  kimble is on the run  and gerard is out to find him  
it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent  vindictive inspector javert  but that never happens  
instead jones plays him as a sharp  committed man whos just doing his job  so that when he responds to kimbles comment   i didnt kill my wife   with a matteroffact   i dont care   we know exactly what he means  
its not his job to determine guilt or innocence  
its his job to bring in a fugitive  
this is a well written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form  
the only unfortunate thing about jones stunning turn is that its likely to overshadow harrison ford  and thats a shame  
for his entire career  ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero  
however  he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble  always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence  
the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing  and ford is up to the task  
this summer has been loaded with actionsuspense films  and most of them have been doing brisk business  
however  its time for clint  sean  and various dinosaurs to step aside  
the chase is on  
my advice is to catch it
