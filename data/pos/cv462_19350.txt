this has some major spoilers for the film  so be forwarned  
the wont appear till later in the article  so youre safe for now  
eyes wide shot    running time   hours  minutes      theatrical aspect 
starring  tom cruise  dr  
bill hardford   nicole kidman  alice hardford   sidney pollack  leelee sobieski  todd field  nick nightingale  directed  cowritten  produced by  stanley kubrick inspired by   traumnovelle  by  arthur schnitzer 
this is an interesting film  
i must first off state  that you musnt believe any of the rumors of the film  
cruise is not a cross dresser  kidman doesnt shoot heroin  and theres not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist  
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written  
the translation   dream novel   makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film  
there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film  
rather than complain about it as some may and already have  see it as a style of shooting  
i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could  
this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly  
as an auteur and stickler for details  kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one  
the film looks great  but there are a good deal of bloopersflubs that occur  
you see lots of boom shots  in reflection  and you see the camera at least twice  
 months for this  
wow  
reflection is the biggest killer for this film  
their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these  some quite glaringly  
one more topic of heated discussion  i saw the  austin powers  version  and to be perfectly frank  unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be  youll probably not see them  
two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious  but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way its supposed to be  
spoilers below  
the film itself starts with  cruise  bill and  kidman  alice getting ready for a little xmas soiree  
they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment  which is actually an apartment owned by pollack  
bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the partys entertainment  
soon after  bill and alice are flirting with others at the party  thinking that the other has not noticed  
bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time  
the next day  bill and alice  casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations  
they both discover that they both knew about the flirting  
bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship  and gets alice extremely angry  
in her hazy state  she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill  not caring about the possible aftereffects  
bill gets called away when one of his patients dies  and goes to console his daughter  
when his patients engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection  he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife  alice and a naval officer  
he sees  opportunity  as a betrayal to his wife  and before they can continue  they are interrupted  
as he strolls home  he encounters a hooker  
seeing another  opportunity  arise  he follows the hooker home  
they toy around  but before the act ensues  alice calls his cell phone  
he breaks the date with the hooker  and heads back out into the night  
he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing  so he heads in  
when he meets the friend  the friend reveals that for extra scratch  he plays these strange parties  while blindfolded  
bill is intrigued and wants to go to one  
nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password  
what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl  leelee sobieski  and her father  
the young girl has drawn his eye  but her young age  and the prescence of her father deter this from happening  
he gets to the party  which is to say the least  a strange affair  
after partaking in some strange  religious  right  women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies  
a woman warns bill in disguise  that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party  
he is detained after a second warning  where he is outed for not being in the group  
after getting home  he hides the evidence of his evenings events  
unable to carry on in his day  he tries piece the events of the previous night together  
in the process  he finds that nick has disappeared  his life is possibly in danger  and the woman that warned him has died  
im trying to save a bit of the film here  its worth sitting through to get to this point  
this is only about  minutes at this point  
this is a strange film  because despite the events that occur  the film has a strong family message behind it  
it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film  
its got sex in it  it has nudity  drugs  and many more immoralistic values  
but they all serve to show why they are bad in ones life  
i recommend this film highly on many merits  
cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than  minutes after the opening scene  and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself
