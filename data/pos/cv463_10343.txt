one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids  
although blackandwhite films are frequently viewed as suspect  ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind  
and if you can find a colorful action film  even if it is from six decades ago  then there is a real possibility of a take home hit  
so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood  a high spirited version of the walter scott story  
nominated for the  academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngolds melodramatic music  ralph dawsons fast paced editing and carl jules weyls lush sets  the film is probably best remembered for errol flynns charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley  a  k  a  robin hood  
flynn  with his handsome figure and toothy smile  charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself  
let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household  
the littlest rhodes  jeffrey  age   liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more  
ill let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review  
simply stated  the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre  the swashbuckler  
robin  with a smile from eartoear  fights off a hundred men without a scratch  
although the picture can be considered as little more than a s james bond  the production values and the acting raise it above that level  
robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor  
robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows  
in this movie  however  he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country  
robin  with his courage and athletic skills  serves as a role model for kids  
and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamyeyed lady marian fitzswalter  the story has heavy romantic overtones  
filmed in the typical  richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor  the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties  which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players  
in scene after scene the picture charms the audience  
who wouldnt fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest  even if the outcome is so clearly preordained  
and  of course  he doesnt just win  he does so by splitting the other mans arrow  
watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments  
sherlock holmes as the villain  sir guy of gisbourne  for example  just doesnt seem right  even if basil rathbone did have a reallife identity outside of his most famous role  
and then there are those wigs from the makeup department  so bad  they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy  
as was popular in the cinema of that era  people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty  bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks  
bad guys are banished rather than killed  and lovers go off handinhand  doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing  
the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful  cartoonish figures  
hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore  so try to savor the old ones when you can  
the adventures of robin hood runs     
it is not rated  but containing absolutely nothing offensive  it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages  
jeffrey thinks the film is  great  and gives it      
he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures  he hates the sight of blood in movies  
his favorite parts are the battles and the ending  and his favorite characters are robin and king richard  ian hunter
