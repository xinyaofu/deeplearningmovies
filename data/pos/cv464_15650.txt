swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults  
steven spielberg may not have directed  he only executive produced  but his touch certainly is evident in this movie  
and he knows a money making winner when he sees one  
the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster  big action  funny comedy  and the pacing of a rollercoaster  
hopkins plays don diego de la vega  otherwise known as zorro  
a fighter for the people  he is eventually captured by don rafael montero  stuart wilson   who also  unintentionally  kills his wife  
the film cuts to twenty years later  where vega still wants to montero dead  
however  hes far too old now  and trains up thief alejandro murrieta  banderas  to become the new zorro  
banderas motive  
to avenge the death of his brother  who was killed at the hands of captain love  matthew letscher  who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar  in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie  
with the scene set  the movie goes on full blast  with sword fights aplenty and witty one liners  
banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorros  playing each other off with ease  
hopkins seems to come off a little better  but banderas does some excellent work  
as the bad guys  wilson and letscher seem one dimensional  but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way  
the audience does hate them  which cant be bad  
catherine zetajones also pops up as hopkins daughter  and although she provides little more than the usual female lead  she delivers a charming  but one note  performance  
the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones  
theres a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight  and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed  until jones clothes fall off all together  
the director  fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye    handles the film perfectly  
the action is well done and fast paced  the comedy put across well  
the cast help a lot  but the direction is still outstanding  
although the film is very long  the plot keeps chugging along  and theres barely a dull moment  
however  the film is a little over indulgent  and it could have been trimmed  
it manages to hold the attention  thankfully  and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel  
screenwriters john eskow  ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script  
although theyve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action  the plot itself is barely existent  
theres lots of little sub plots hanging around  but theres nothing substantial to bring them all together  
the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to buy california using gold stolen from the guy hes buying the land off  
this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines  
however  this doesnt seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film  so the film is never quite sure where its going  
in the end however  zorro provides action and comedy in spades  
it suitable for everyone  so put the guilt behind  and put some more money into spielbergs bank account  
you wont regret it
