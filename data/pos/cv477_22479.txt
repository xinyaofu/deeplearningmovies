if this keeps up  jane austen  sense and sensibility  pride and prejudice  may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild  
yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen  
mansfield park is a turn of the century  th century going on th  story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties  
ten year old fanny price  hannah taylorgordon  jakob the liar   taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell  is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park  under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle  sir thomas bertram  harold pinter  mojo  
spending her days reminded of her lower status  she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times  
fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful  intelligent  and engaging heroine  quite unlike the original character which ms  austen originally penned in her novel   
writerdirector patricia rozema  when night is falling  is responsible for the textual changes  
from a purely dramatic perspective  the revision makes perfect sense and improves the films audience appeal  
what ms  rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms  austens own personality by including excerpts from the authors journals  giving that dialogue to fanny  
the result is a central character that is immediately appealing  
as the grown fanny  australian actress frances oconnor  all about adam  does wonderfully textured work  
at times  ms  rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novels more introspective observations  
this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms  oconnors credit that it works as well as it does  
the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one    
whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing  
fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund  jonny lee miller  plunkett  macleane  who appears fond of her as well  
his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford  embeth davidtz  bicentennial man  enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry  alessandro nivola  inventing the abbotts  who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny  
while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections  their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the films appropriately austenlike ending  
other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park    
the slave trade  
there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten  
the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust  
fannys cousin  maria bertram  victoria hamilton  persuasion  is an example of one making a poor match  marrying a welltodo fool who is able to make her comfortable  but never happy  
fannys own mother  trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she  married for love   
fanny  given those two terrible examples  and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean  
the spiritual answer  of course  lies in the middle of those two extremes  
marriage is not a cold  calculating decision based upon selfpreservation  
neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace  
in the purest sense  marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one  
  and said  for this cause shall a man leave father and mother  and shall cleave to his wife  and they twain shall be one flesh   
matthew    kjv 
love and logic can be combined  
gods word contains both  
so does a marriage based upon his truth
