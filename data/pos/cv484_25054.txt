susan grangers review of  the perfect storm   warner bros   
  more people die on fishing boats  per capita  than working in any other job in the u  s   
every journey a fishing boat makes can be an allornothing risk  
it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying   says director wolfgang petersen   das boot    
and thats just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat  the andrea gail  sailing out of gloucester  massachusetts  in late october    
early in bill wittliffs screenplay  based on sebastian jungers bestseller  we meet the crew of six  
the veteran captain  george clooney  is frustrated because he cant find fish on the grand banks  yet a rival skipper  mary elizabeth mastrantonio  brings in huge hauls  
his righthand man  mark walhberg  needs money to build a new life with his girlfriend  diane lane   
theres a devoted dad  john c  reilly  with an estranged wife and son  a freespirited jamaican  allen payne   a lonely guy  john hawkes   and a lastminute replacement with a bad attitude  william fichtner   
the skippers convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap  and he does  
but then trouble begins  
theres a rogue wave  a man overboard and the ice machine breaks  with    lb  
of fish that could spoil  
but thats minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as  a disaster of epic proportions  that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas  
its formulaic and there are cliches  but the walls of water  created by fluid dynamics simulating reallife phenomena  are awesome  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    the perfect storm  is a terrifying  suspenseful   
hang on for the whiteknuckle thrill ride of the summer
