capsule  sidesplitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end    
but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs  
most comedies these days have one flaw  
theyre not funny  
they think theyre funny  but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly  
occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem  ruthless people  for instance  which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end  
liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny  
this is one of the few movies ive seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through  instead of a couple of setpieces that inspired a laugh  think of the dismal fatal instinct   the whole movie works like clockwork  
jim carrey playes a highpowered lawyer  to whom lying is as natural as breathing  
there is one thing he takes seriously  though  his son  and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away  
but his wife is divorced and seeing another man  and now it looks like they may move away together  
the son goes with them  of course  
the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carreys overthetop persona with reality  
then the plot springs into action  after being snubbed  not deliberately  by his father at his birthday  the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles  that for just one day  dad cant lie  
he gets the wish  
what happens next is sidesplitting  
everything turns into a confrontation  when cornered by a bum for some change  he shouts   no  
im not giving you any money because i know youll spend it on booze  
all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society   
he cant even get into an elevator without earning a black eye  
and whats worse  hes now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture  
carrey  who i used to find unfunny  has gotten better at his schtick  even if its a limited one  
he uses it to great effect in this movie  
there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process  theres a grin breaking out across my face right now  just remembering the scene   
he cant even write the lie  his fingers twitch  his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning  and when he tries to talk its like hes speaking in tongues  
equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp  dont ask why   tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom  it fails  with semipredictable results   and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them  
this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end  
the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end  
a shame  too  because the movie insists on having a big  ridiculous climax that involves carreys character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs  then breaking his leg  etc  a simple reconciliation would do the trick  
why is this stupid pentup climax always obligatory  
its not even part of the movies real agenda  
thankfully  liar liar survives it  and so does carrey  
maybe they were being merciful  on reflection  
if id laughed any more  i might have needed an iron lung
