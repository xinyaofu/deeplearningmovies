maybe the most important thing about this movie is that its not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month  because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker  broadcasted on abc on a monday night  starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth  respectively  
because its not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why its so great  
underneath the todiefor cinematography  the brilliant acting  and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty  not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it  tell it in a certain original way  
it doesnt merely go from plot point to plot point  
it goes from character to character  
it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all  and makes the story of a worldreknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters  both musicians  who have a totally unique relationship  
its that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball  shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this  unlike  patch adams   effortlessly emotional and real  
in short  this movie is just awesome  
it merely tells its story really well  and thats something that just has to be commended these days  when most stories are botched because theyre not told by great storytellers  
director anand tucker tells this story well  
he overdramaticizes everything  but still keeps it real  
the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr   rachel griffiths and emily watson  respectively   two sisters who are first seen in childhood  played by auriol evans and keely flanders  respectively  as the very best of friends  
they are also both musicians  hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist  and when it all begins  both are considered child prodigies  but hilary is seen as the better of the two  
jackie  a bit jealous  works and works at her playing skills  and soon the tables are turned  
when they both hit adulthood  hilary strives for a comeback  while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world  but instead of fame  captures the heart of a hapless  joyful conductor  kiffer finzi  david morissey  in a semistarmaking turn   
they marry  after a short courtship  and move to a lovely country house  making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life  when she plays  she has the eyes of the world  but when she stops  shes alone  
she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist  daniel barenboim  james frain   in hopes that she may overcloud her sister  but she eventually begins to lose it  and runs away to hilarys country home  where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband  since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure  
its all terribly melodramtic  as you can see  and by the time jackie has contracted ms  in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semismiliar  shine  in technical and emotional devastation   it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadnt been handled in such a way  
the key thing here is that its not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that its about her tumultuous relationship with her sister  which  i might add  is perfectly realized  
their relationship is the most downtoearth complex entity of the year  they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world  but theyre also completely jealous of one another  
when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities  she tries in vain to make a comeback but cant  and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success  
when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man  she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that ive ever seen in a film  only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man   
and the whole time  their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested  
another thing i really liked is emily watsons performance  
i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease  or any combination of the three   
my reasoning for this is that its a fucking easy job  
the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in  beloved   sure  shes good  but whats so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around  slurs her words together  and acts like a three year old inside a year olds body  
hell  i could play that if i had a pair of breasts  
in that same exact movie  though  is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane  her brothers run off never to be seen again  and her mothers lover is scared off  
she has to actually deal with real emotions  something much harder than mere stumbling about  
but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons  
if you dont believe me  look at jack nicholsons performance in  as good as it gets   great performance  but easy job  
this isnt so for watson  though  because her insanity comes from real emotions  not just a plot point  
and thanks to the opening sequence  where we see her and hilary as kids  we understand the motives behind all her actions  and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life  weve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses  
rachel griffiths  who would have otherwise been the understudy to watsons protagonist  actually matches watson stepforstep  because as watson grows insane  and demands unspeakable things from her  griffiths holds her own  and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her  
griffiths  an otherwise unknown actress  and watson being famous from  breaking the waves  and  the boxer    is absolutely brilliant  just as absolutely brilliant as watson is  and if the academy and all the other critics groups  whove already deemed watsons performance the best of the year  glance over hers because shes the one who doesnt get to go insane  read  she gets the boring role   then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me  
after all  griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real  the tom cruise role in  rainman   the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman   
she does  and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year  its griffiths  
together  the two actresses work extremely well  though  and both have to go through deep emotional hell  the likes of which havent been seen this year  
if it hadnt been for an otherwise nottotallygreat final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary  when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety   id say this is one of the top ten best films of the year  
its so close to perfection  in its structure  its treatment of its subject  and its beautiful technical specifications  cinematography nomination  without a shred of doubt in my mind  and maybe film editing   that its nearly a shame that its not the flawless gem that it should be  
but  hey  as it is  i can hardly complain
