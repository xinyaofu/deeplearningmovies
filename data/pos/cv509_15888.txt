as i write the review for the new hanksryan romantic comedy youve got mail  i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  
i am also aware that i have just spent the last  hours watching the worlds biggest paid commercial for america online  
and i wonder  is that so bad  
well  the commercial part is  
as for the movie  well  as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan  i think ill be okay  
to paraphrase james berardinelli  whose reviews i admire very much  tom hanks and meg ryan can act  
they are both wonderful  but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films  such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan  and his glorious triumph in philadelphia  i like him best when hes suitably obnoxious  
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when hes going to get the girl  the only question is how  
meg ryan  americas high school sweetheart  can act  
shes had a handful of memorable performances  including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally  i must not mention what she does  due to the  well  um  you get the idea  and if you dont  get the movie fantastic   
but  i like her best when shes  well  perky  
she is so adorably perkycute that together with hanks  they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples  but i dont really know  
all i know is that i just like them both  
they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thats really hard to resist  and im not going to even try  
theyre just really  really cute  sweet  and charming  
hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron  who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle  
here  the setup is a little different  
kathleen kelly  ryan  owns a small childrens bookstore which her mother founded  years ago and passed down to her  
she is successful  beautiful  and dates a wellknown columnist with very radical idea  kinnear   
she is also having an affair  of sorts  
you see  kathleen  with the handle shopgirl  is secretly emailing ny  
they have a strictly undetailed relationship  there are no specifics  and they have no idea who each other is  
ny happens to be joe fox  hanks   a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of megabookstores  run by his father  coleman   
fox books has decided to open a store on the west side  right across from a little childrens bookseller named  shop around the corner   run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly  
every morning  these two email each other silly  and every day  they fight  to the death     
its a charming premise  and one that works nicely  balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have  
it also has the great sense of being a classic romance  there is no  lets have sex tonight  mantra  if youll excuse my bluntness  
this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love  
hmm  well  the movie goes through twists and turns  having some sad moments and happy ones  until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan  hook up   to use modern terminology  and kiss their way into happiness  
you know its going to happen  the question is now  
thankfully  ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey  kinnear  chappelle  and a host of others  including a great scene involving brothers  aunts  and two sweet kids  
its all cute and wonderful  and for all of the idealism  it makes me feel good  
hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is  
he is  i believe  americas greatest actor  
does he show it here  
nah  
but hes still tom hanks  and shes still meg ryan  
which is what this movie boils down to  
its pure confection  
all the bits about the godfather  the jokes  the superb script  its all really sweet  
there are some immense flaws  like pacing  
the last third of the movie really doesnt work as well as i would have liked  and for a romantic comedy  its slow  
once hanks knows the secret  it gets really slow  
i even looked at my watch a couple times  to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for  so that i could get home at a reasonable hour  
the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated  
email  
when my kids are my age  i dont know what well be using  
but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody  and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history  
they just work together  and its nice to see  
it gives you  well  a smile  
the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious  and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake  
i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was  
ive always believed that movies are very powerful  very powerful indeed  
you see  mankind has three abilities he needs to survive  the ability to think  entertain  and procreate  
movies can definitely do the first two  and as for the third  well  id rather not think about that  
i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint  and that films that entertained you were good  because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night  
and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had  
hanks was the driving force behind one of the years best films in saving private ryan  which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world  
hes also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment  
tom hanks and meg ryan are magical  as is this movie  
its a sweet  lovely affair with a technology twist  
it may be a long commercial  but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face
