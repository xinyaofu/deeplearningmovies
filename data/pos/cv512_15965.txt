it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship  a green ovular pin  and the birth of oscar wilde  but if one really strains  they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off  
wildes philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature  and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned  loosing his family and his career  
the glam rock movement in the early s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise  
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life  mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality   they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else  
and thats why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began  
its been said that todd haynes  velvet goldmine   the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement  not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it  steals a lot from  citizen kane   and thats true  
in the film  a british journalist in the s  arthur stuart  christian bale   is asked to go back and find out what happened to s glam rock star brian slade  a fictitious rock star  who faked his own death on stage  bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement  
structurewise  this totally steals from  kane   not only from the setup  he interviews three people  and the story is a result of their flashbacks   but in other things  like the beginning  death  then newsreel   and smaller details  like the bitter exfriend in a wheelchair and the bitter exwife as a washedup lounge singer  found in a bar after hours  
this is no  kane   and it really doesnt aspire to be  it doesnt attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like  kane  did  and it doesnt really uncover anything poignant about humanity  
instead  it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants  
the s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy  equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging  
but the s scenes are engaging  though  not to mention addictively campy  
they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era  and a feel thats so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the thenfootage  they become not only a symbol of decadence  but of times when everything seemed so simple  
instead of creating the world the way it was  haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale  the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after youve experienced it  everything else seems so mundane  
theres no outside world to speak of  secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack  
haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero  curt wild  and their relationship that created  molded  and then brought down the movement  reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that  contributors  
blade  played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers  and wild  played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor  are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop  respectively  complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been onetime partners in music  but also partners in bed  
through discussions with slades exmanager cecil  michael feast   exwife mandy  toni collette  reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade   and finally expartner wild  journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era  like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity  including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality  when he opens up his first slade record  he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket   and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene  finally resulting in leading a boring job in america  
haynes demonstrates that hes quite the visual auteur  molding scenes that are like long heald breaths  such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a sladewild concert of them performing a brian eno cover   babys on fire   with scenes from a decadent drug party  and the films most wowinspiring sequence  the first concert scene of wild with his band  the ratttz  where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggyesuqe movements  including stripping naked  and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent  and another  slade  discovers his idle  
even the brief music videos  spoofs of bowies  have a rare visual flair thats pure camp  and which would cause ken russell to drool  
the best sequence  though  may be the beginning  following the prelude  a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the postmovement era  
in it  stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death  where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination  which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet  
with brian enos famous  needle in the camels eye  playing in the background  the scene has a detached exhileration  the song doesnt seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are  
it has a distance thats hard to put a finger on  and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending  and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show  docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair  depressingly staring into the mirror  it comes off as a nonetooobvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film  
this movies not so much about plot  but more about the way it is presented  making this one of those films which is classified as being  style over substance   a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack  
however  for the most part  the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world  by using his sets  costumes  cinematography  and especially the music to play as characters in his film  
the music is especially notable  
the soundtrack  which is wall to wall  consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno  trex  and roxy music  as well as covers by slades band  with vocals by thom yorke  and occasionally rhys meyers himself   and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowielike  
the cast is rather impressive  but no one really walks away with the film  and no performances are extremely good  
although eddie izzard  as slades manager  who challenges slades first manager to an armwrestling match to see who gets control of his career  and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly  and collette and mcgregor have their moments  rhys meyers and bale are noticably subpar  neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles  
some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes  
rhys meyers brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era  dying when he turned into a retrogarbo  resorting to a life of salingerism  and found in the mids to be lying around  sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl  
in fact  no one in this film is really seen as a person  rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era  
bales character is an especially tough sell  bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood  hes not an extremely personal character  and his cliched experiences  being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a  poof   never help us communicate with him  
nevertheless  rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them  and others  bitter  part of which helps the film work  since this is a major piece of eye candy  
at the prime of the movie  they at least look the role of fashionable leaders  slade with his perpetuallychanging  androgonys persona  and wild with his topless and unpredictable image  which clash and fuse into an unstable union  
their story  of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar whocares attitude crossed with camp  is engaging  without the personal background  
the story of stuart  though  is a tougher sell because hes the everyman  and when you cant totally identify with the everyman  your storys in slight trouble  
as a cultural rock piece   velvet goldmine  is rather good  but it is merely good  
it never totally takes off  although it has moments where it absolutely flies  but then comes back down  
its really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments  surrounded by material that could really be much better  
the beginning is captivating but slow  the middle is fantastic  and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that  it drags  the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion  it could probably stop at any point   
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths  
it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past  which is commendable but not totally so  
still  it does what the oliver stone pic  the doors  didnt do right  becoming very insightful to what happened  using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems halfassed  i suppose the message is   live life  but after youve lived it  what else is the point when youll be forced to live with regretful memories     
the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks  it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era  but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down
