luckily  some people got starship troopers  
some people knew it was supposed to be silly  
for those of you who didnt  how could you miss it  
from the very beginning  when we see an interactive internetlike promotional video for the armed forces of the future  it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly  
i guess without blatant oneliners and home alone style slapstick  some people just dont recognize such goofy humor  
such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned  
first thing to do before seeing this movie  lighten up  
meet the equivalent of  beverly hills   meets  mighty morphin power rangers   
four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces  which  in the future  means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country  
johnny rico  casper van dien  is ready to join the infantry  mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez  denise richards  has enlisted to be a pilot  
dizzy flores  dina meyer  has enlisted as a trooper  and its possible shes joining merely to follow rico  whom shes always had eyes for  
if you saw these three on the street  youd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers  for never has a movies cast looked so much like the cutout cover of  seventeen  magazine  
the lone nonsupermodel  carl jenkins  played by doogie howser himself  neil patrick harris  is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division  the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie  er  carl out of the picture  
  good call  now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters   
right off the bat  rico becomes the star of the show  far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time  
but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise  which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen  leaves rico ready to call it quits  
with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on  johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home  
well sorry  rico suave  but theres no place like home  especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it  
thats right  the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnidlike alien beings that a can of raid just isnt going to destroy  
with a sudden change of heart  and clothes   rico is back in the game  following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs  
what starship troopers really is  is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on  the soap opera like love affairs of high school  the love for scifi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group  etc  nothing is taken seriously  
its almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless  but with its sly and futuristic approach  its not as recognizably so  
its a spoof so subtle that many wont recognize the spoofery  
if you deem this as scifiaction  youre wrong  
its scifiactioncomedy  with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead   starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well  
gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film  but the gore  too  is meant to be cheesy  
yes  its graphic  but its also brutally phony  and thats what makes it such great fun to watch  
not since the old  mr  bill  skits on  saturday night live  has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch  
people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated  
perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters barbie dolls as young children  
with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely  its a good chance this is the case  whether were fully aware of it or not  
starship troopers has its slow parts  but its truly an alternative to your typical scifiaction flick or lame juvenile comedy  
aside from the intentionally cheesy gore  the special effects are quite astounding  
when the spaceship passes a meteor  its quite an awesome spectacle  visually crisp and captivating  
if youre looking for brainless fun  this is the epitome of your search  
a beautiful cast  awesome special effects  fastpaced action  campy acting  and a whole lot of gore  
this is brainless heaven  
just remember not to think
