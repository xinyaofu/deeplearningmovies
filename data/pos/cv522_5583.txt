of circumcision  psychic wounds and the family sitcom 
the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film  
theres a guys voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like  and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women  
as his imagination plays o n  he  and we  picture these motley characters in a mixandmatch shuffle of unlikely marriages  businesswomen with bums  matrons with paint salesmen  the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy  
its not just a witty  funny summing up of the film s themes  you might not guess it yet  but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on  
what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction  gets taken on a road trip  put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash  
that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom  and the general idea of the film doesnt  at first  seem so wildly distant from standardissue hollywood comedy  man who was adopted as a child  ben still er  sets out on a journey to meet his real parents  along with his wife  patricia arquette   his baby  and a pretty psychologyresearcher  tea leoni  in tow  
various mixups  shenanigans  oddball characters and  yup  disasters follow  
but if you think youve been here before  the dialogue and the direction  by david o  russell  who made spanking the monkey  take it into another dimension  
the dreaded tname seems an inevitable reference point  what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance  but really the point is that the footmassage master hasnt got a monopoly on plot twists and fast  funny  irreverent lines  or on the absurdities of ordinary speech  
whether its about circumcision  psychic wounds  oral sex  carjacking  the beauties of the armpit area  or ronald reagan  the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention  
the best thing is how these words arent just there for the punchlines  but are great precisely because theyre said in character  like tea leonis neuroticallycharged psychobabbler whos able to say under assault   its understandable if you find this threatening   
the cast is excellent throughout  and  rather than singling out anybody  kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting  with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission  
there are some elements of a woody allen film in this  not to mention the handheld camera and loose  improvisational feel of some scenes   
like allen  russells interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children  and everybody  really   
still  if youre expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la  murphy brown    frasier   fillintheblankamericancomedy  well  it wont happen  
the film sets up expectations like these  with the lead characters search f or his origins and his hopes of selfhealing  only to knock them down  
if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey oneness  flirting with disasters charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go  
and that  the film suggests  is the essential family state  and you better learn to love it  
somehow  this is perversely feelgood cinema  right up to its manic end
