studio expectations must not have been high for  great expectations   the films release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute  therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in   
its actually a smart move  because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isnt quite oscar fodder  it  is  strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year  
  great expectations  also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right  especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmanns  william shakespeares romeo  juliet   
  great expectations  opens somewhere in s florida  the original story is set in thcentury england   as eightyearold finn  jeremy james kissner  meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future  
theres icy  yearold estella  raquel beaudene   a pseudoplaymate of finns  ms  dinsmoor  anne bancroft   estellas auntie whos quite offkilter over a past romance that never took off  and a mysterious prisoner  robert de niro  whom finn saves the life of  
finn  who lives with his sisters affable boyfriend  lone stars chris cooper   fancies himself an aspiring artist  and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms  dinsmoors lipstick  eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion  
flash forward into the s  after a brief stop in the s   and finn  now played by ethan hawke   despondent over a strange hotandcold relationship with the elusive estella  gwyneth paltrow   receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor  its enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art  
there  finn seems to gain everything he could ever want  wealth  prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world  
when estella resurfaces  albeit with an aloof fianc   hank azaria   finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction  
but shes not the only ghost from finns past thats going to be paying him a visit  
comparisons with the aforementioned  romeo  juliet  seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting  
  great expectations  is a much better venture  though  because it treats its source with evenhanded respect  where  romeo  was never quite sure whether to be a spoof  a homage or both  
the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezkis sexy cinematography  notably  he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious  erotic charge thats steamier than the films  surprisingly muted  love scenes  
the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the onscreen action beautifully  especially new songs by tori amos  mono and duncan sheik  
acting credits are firstrate  often hiding the screenplays occasional slipups  
hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man  something we also learned from  gattaca    and his finn is quite a likeable guy  
paltrows estella  on the other hand  is rather underdeveloped  
while the actress is at her icily seductive best  were not told very much about her character  and as a result  its often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level  but  oh   what  a physical level   sometimes  we root for finn although we dont quite understand why shes fueling his fire  
robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play  on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft  a macabre  throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous  
alfonso cuarons visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movies climax  
another problem is predictability  you can guess your way through the plot even if you arent familiar with the story  
despite its script flaws  though   great expectations  is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy  
and frankly  its nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality  
perhaps that renovated release date  awfully close to valentines day  will end up helping  great expectations   seemingly average box office chances after all
