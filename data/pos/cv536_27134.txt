ill be the first to admit i didnt expect much from the emperors new groove  more celine dionesque songanddance numbers  cuddly characters that become crosspromotion devices in mcdonalds happy meals  and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voiceover job to their resume  
i was dead wrong about all of those things  
the emperors new groove is funny  
damn funny  
and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones  
the script is fast and furious  with no singing and dancing  
the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over  
the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us  
the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking  crossdressing llamas and schizophrenia  
heres the plot  try to follow along  
set in a mythical kingdom  the film follows the adventures of kuzco  david spade   an arrogant and egocentric emperor  
when kuzco fires his powerhungry advisor  yzma  eartha kitt   she and her  assistant  kronk  seinfelds patrick warburton  change him into a llama  
kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha  john goodman   a llamaherder whose home was to be replaced by kuzcos water world theme park  to save him  
then the fun starts  
for the next sixty minutes  the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days  imagination  
yzma  voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt  looks like a cross between norma desmond  joan crawford  and a really old vegas showgirl  
the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick  sharp  and feels like an episode of seinfeld  which would make sense   
david spade and john goodmans character interactions make you feel like youre watching an old hopecrosby film  
spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions  and i laughed out loud several times  
needless to say  that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days  
the best part about the emperors new groove is how audacious the film is  
the sheer weirdness factor is very high  
crossdressing  schizophrenia  duality of soul  people being turned into every animal on noahs boat  llama cpr  homoerotic tendencies  an emperor with his own theme song and singer  michael jackson dance moves  and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal  
simply put  the emperors new groove is one of the best childrens films out for this holiday season  
kids will enjoy the adventures  and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue  
thats a tough thing to pull off in a single package  but this emperor manages to do it
