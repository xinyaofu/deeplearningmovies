tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever  
not surprising  considering its tiny us   budget  to date it has earned in excess of us million  
thats a shocking  times profit  
rumours have it that a smart internet marketing ploy was so successful in gaining cultlike fanatics  by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews  the film just exploded in the boxoffice  raking in millions on its opening weekend  
shot in mm and video  i suspect    the film chronicles the forays of  students who go in search for the legendary blair witch  
audiences are put in the firstperson perspective in the entire misadventure  often wobbly and blurry at times  it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning  
this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the  disappeared  edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences  
tbwp is simply smart  
filmed to look as if it was really a stockshoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project  one may suspect  like yours truly  that its simply a lazy but smart approach to filmmaking  
simply amazing in that respect  i must say  
talk about impact  oh yes  tbwp does have quite a bit  in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing  
i did  especially the last bit but im not revealing more  
you have to see it for yourself  
i cant help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become  
could it be that finally  an indiefilm has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal  
or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning  
well  i guess the fact stays  tbwp is highly original  clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film  
no gore  no special effects  i just cant get over how terribly smart this film is
