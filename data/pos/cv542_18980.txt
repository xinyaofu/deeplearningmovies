dont let the following quirks of this review  fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love  
but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that  
life is beautiful  even though im a short  ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh  
life is beautiful even though i havent amounted to much in life  except working out the finer intricacies of waitering  
im a lucky sort of a guy  especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age  sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath  life is beautiful  
im a jew  but life can still be beautiful  
the nazis put me in a concentration camp  but life is still beautiful  
i love my son very much and thats what matters  and thats what makes life beautiful  
my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful  
i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love  but hey thats life and thats still a beautiful thing  so by jove dont give me any crap about it  
by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved  
well done  there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni
