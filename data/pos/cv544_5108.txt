no matter what you suspect  this isnt your usual action thriller  
the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer  
its one of those movies that  after everything is revealed rapidfire at the end  you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light  
plot twists agogo are what you get here  i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me  
keyser soze is a name youll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason  
its not only the name of the mysterious  and possibly even mythical  crime boss in the movie  it also sums up the movie   keyser soze  in latin means  an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer   
or maybe i shouldnt have bought a foreignlanguage dictionary from the same company that makes those cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets  
at the movies opening  a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup  including mcmanus  stephen baldwin   keaton  gabriel byrne   fenster  benicio del toro   buckney  kevin pollack  and verbal  kevin spacey  winner of the best supporting actor academy awardsymbol   f  times new roman   s   h for his performance in the movie   
verbal is sonamed because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing  
he also earns his name as the movies narrator  spouting memorable lines like  the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt exist   although  obviously  he does exist  what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in    while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri  any actor with multiple zs in their name is okay in my book   
we see the story unfold as spacey retells it  
the five felons  upon being released from the lineup  get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service  whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars  and stealing all the money and drugs in the car  
its a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals  who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze  who sends a minion to them with an offer they cant refuse  
namely  they have to destroy sozes main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship  shooting a bunch of people  burning all the drugs and stealing  million cash  
spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent  cripple  character to life and baldwin  byrne  palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast  
the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense  keeping the viewer guessing until the very end  and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion  
i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv  
a different mystery  i guess  which may turn into a murder mystery if that video ever comes on again
