imagine this scenario  you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long  excruciating crosscountry car trips  far from the city and into the deserted rural routes  
so far  the trip is idyllic when  abruptly  your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere  
it is not an easy situation  but a perfectly plausible one  the panorama in which breakdown musters its throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness  
it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays  but breakdown doesnt bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful  titillating climax that by its finale  engrosses a viewer with total absorption  
the plot is somewhat reminiscent of s the vanishing  
kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor  a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job  
when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest  jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver  who later  will be an important player in the plot department  
minutes later after that  their brand new  strikingly red  jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops  
jeff cannot detect the cars problem  so he allows amy to take a ride with red  j  
t walsh   a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town  where jeff will meet her at a local diner  
it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudosuspenser  but instead it opts for maximum fervor  
jeff manages to restart the car himself  but when he arrives at the diner  she is nowhere in sight  
disconcerted  the coffee shops bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife  a town about twenty miles from here  
there  trouble arises  
and i shall not reveal anything else  since that would be spoiling the fun of whats head  
there are many involving  tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck  will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam  
it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil  and rooting for the good guys  in this case jeff  
kurt russell is one of the few topnotch hollywood actors which doesnt overblow his acting  and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses  
so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letterperfect  
suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation  from a jolly man  to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one  
not many wellpaid actors can deliver these type of performances  but russell is one of them  
as an everyday man  he pulls it off extremely convincingly  what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality  which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films  minutes  
although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences  very well done  yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with  
faced with an enigma about his wifes whereabouts  the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters  including the cryptic villains  who in essence  make the movie what it is  
whats most impressive however  is the feature debut by writerdirector jonathan mostow  
mostow  hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle  alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot  efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nailbiting suspense sought for in a well made affair  
contrary to most american thrillers  he doesnt rely on visual flair  but on aesthetics and substance  
after breakdown  he should gain vast notoriety  
the villains in the movie arent your routine outofthisworld idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective  
the baddies in breakdown  all well acted  are normal  seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer  conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder  
the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks  and  of all things in the world  it is becoming rather easy to root for villains  jon voight in anaconda  in todays movies  
worth a special mentioning is j  t walsh  who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision  as the leader of the gang  he renders a deliciously wicked performance  temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for  
alfred hitchcock used suspenseand action not only to stimulate  but as a way of aiding his audiences fascination in his stories  which were slowly realizing mans biggest fears  
breakdown yields exactly that  
it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man  acting like an ordinary man  looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero  
despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock  i think  would approve of breakdown
