steve soderberghs  sex  lies  and videotape   which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in   arguably began the resurgence of independent films  
made on a shoestring budget of    million  with then relatively unknown actors  it is a provocative  thoroughly original drama  
the film mostly focuses on the four central characters  all in their late searly s  
ann  andie macdowell   an unfulfilled housewife  is married to john  peter gallagher   an insensitive lawyer  who  unbeknownst to her  is having an affair with her younger sister  cynthia  laura san giacomo   
complicating matters even worse is graham  james spader  who won best actor at cannes   johns old college buddy  who comes to stay at their house  
ann is absolutely won over by him  even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex  
that is the setup for the last hour of the picture  and since the film is entitled   sex  lies  and videotape   it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise  
director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker  ranging from the independent  to the mainstream  s  out of sight    to the downright kafkaesque  s  schizopolis    
he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances  and believes in the work that he does  and   sex  lies  and videotape   is probably his most confident  and maybe even best  to date  
the performances are superb from all four leads  but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character  
she is always a very winning actress  but this is probably her most threedimensional role that she has had  with a close second being altmans  mosaic   short cuts    
the other parts are perfectly cast as well  from spaders ominous graham  to gallaghers selfinvolved john  to giacomos outspoken cynthia  
the final act of the film  especially  comes right out of left field  and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching  and it would be criminal to give away the films secrets  
suffice to say that  through one powerful sequence  ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell  and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty  as well as deception  
the film has one fault  however  
the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another  and often unlikable  
if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher  it probably would have helped  since his relationship with macdowell isnt quite as explored as i would have liked  
  sex  lies  and videotape   although minorly flawed  is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film  
soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it  and the final product certainly proves this
