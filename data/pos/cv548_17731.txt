synopsis  private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband  
after uncovering the authenticity of the film  welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers  
comments   mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time  
though it doesnt present a snuff film  a movie which documents a persons murder for real  usually during or after some form of sexual act  as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as  say  natural born killers   mm stays in your head long after you see it  
it is not fun to watch  see something else if you get upset by realistic  sadistic violence  
this films violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc territory  
for those with strong stomachs  however   mm is an intelligent  worthwhile thriller  especially during its second hour  
nicolas cage  after a couple hohum movies  returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities  
as tom welles  a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newlyborn daughter  cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants  
serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix  who plays a struggling songwriter named max california  
california  despite his name  is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character  and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character  
the real star of the movie  though  must be peter stormare  
stormare played the  really  really evil guy  in fargo  and his character  dino velvet  in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable  
his performance is very chilling  
 mms success may hardly be surprising  
it was directed by joel schumacher  who  hopefully  saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin  
before directing the last two batman duds  however  schumacher was responsible for several wellmade horror flicks  lost boys  flatliners  and falling down  
 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who selfdestructs before the audiences eyes  
 mm was written by andrew kevin walker  who also penned the academy awardwinning thriller seven a few years back  
like seven   mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater  
welles is searching for answers  
how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly  methodically  sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film  
when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end  the murderer responds that there are no reasons  
he just enjoys it  
that  walker seems to suggest  is where the real terror lays  not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist  
a couple minor faults led me to my fourstar rating  five stars is the highest rating i give   
one  i found it a little difficult  early on  to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film  
yes  snuff is a horrible thing  but a detective of welles caliber has probably encountered awful things before  
second  some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient  
he discovers  for example  the victims diary in her private bathroom  despite the fact the the police  the fbi  and her own mother have all investigated the room before  
finally  the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film  
despite the above criticisms   mm is an engrossing story  
one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles  who no longer seems like a hero  brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film  
he pulls a gun on the man and  for a relatively long amount of time  struggles to decide whether or not to kill him  
he then leaves the building and calls the victims mother  in the middle of the night  to basically see if she would support the action  
the entire scene is tense  unpredictable  and emotionally charged  
rarely  anymore  do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as  mm  with scenes like this  did  
 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart  
this is a graphic  oftentimes unflinching  look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people  
if youre prepared for a film of this nature  i give it an enthusiastic recommendation
