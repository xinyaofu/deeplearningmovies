theres good news and bad news about mulan  
the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavyhandedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules  
on the other hand  the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs  several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast  
but mulan is a step in the right direction and disneys best animated feature since the lion king  
after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas  disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians  
mulan is set in feudal china and features the everpopular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married  
thats what we find out when young mulan  voice of ming na wen  screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her  
cartoons    
meanwhile  word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns  
since mulans a girl  that means her decrepit old father must go  
she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad  but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family  
thats chinese culture for you    
so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her fathers uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place  
the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army  
it should have been called g  i  
chang  
mulan calls on her ancestors for help  
they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her  but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up  
voiced by eddie murphy  mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges  
murphys performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin  lots of wisecracks and adlibs and even an introductory song about how much fun theyre going to have  
you aint never had a friend like mushu  
speaking of songs  mulan doesnt have too many of them  which is a plus with a story like this  
disney songs about war probably wouldnt go over too well   heigh ho  heigh ho  its off to war i go       and the ones they do have arent memorable  
the best of the bunch  sad to say  is  be a man   the requisite basic training montage song  
yes  even in medieval china  they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle  
sung by donnie osmond  a bad sign if ever there was one    be a man  accompanies footage of mulans platoon going from screwups to heroes  
it makes me wonder  has there ever been a musical montage in a movie thats ended badly  
i only wish reallife problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage  
for the curious  mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl  
all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulderlength  talk macho and slap guys on the butt  as was male custom a thousand years ago in china  
the deception fools everyone but the audience  who thinks she might be able to pass for a yearold boy  at best  
but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army  led by a big  evileyed attillalooking monster  
as a villain  the head of the huns is menacing  evil and entirely forgettable  
i saw the movie yesterday and i dont remember the mans name  
otherwise  mulan is a good movie  
the animation of the characters themselves isnt as rich as it could and should be  but there are some amazing battlefield shots  
eddie murphy pulls off some good oneliners  as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita  the quintessential asian movie star  
hell  george  mr  sulu  takei does a voice in mulan  
you get the sense disney said to themselves   alright  lets get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood  
who can you think of   
  well  theres mr  myagi     
  good   
  and mr  sulu   
  perfect  
weve got ourselves a movie now   
soon disney really will be able to paint with all the colors of the wind
