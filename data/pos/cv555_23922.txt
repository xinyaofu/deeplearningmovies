harmless  silly and fun comedy about dimwitted wrestling fans gordie and sean  david arquette and scott caan  who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king  oliver platt   
when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter  joe pantoliano   gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory  
my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on  as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed  but not fake  mind you   
the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that  
arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances  which is exactly what a movie like this requires  and oliver platt  one of my favorite actors  is a riot as the drunken washedup exchampion  
many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record  but for me it just added to the  silly factor  of the film  thereby increasing my enjoyment of it  
one casting complaint however  rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer  
please    
if rose mcgowan is sexy then im marilyn manson  
given the current state of the actual wcw  if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming  hed be the most popular guy they have  
on a similar note  the  plot line  of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years  
although one does have to ask    
why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans  
director brian robbins  youll remember him as eric from tvs  head of the class   just knows how to make good dumb movies  
this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues  
and screenwriter steven brill  the epic mighty ducks trilogy  late last night  manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time  with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me  
the only exceptions to that were    a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and   any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan  
those moments made me cringe andor groan  
as an added bonus though  the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll
