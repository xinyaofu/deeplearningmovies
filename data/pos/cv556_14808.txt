steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities  because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits  like jurassic park  and  oscar  awarded critical triumphs like schindlers list  
however  in the s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  
one of them is close encounters of the third kind  extremely popular and influential sciencefiction spectacle  
unfortunately  it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  
although both films have a lot in common  groundbreaking special effects  brilliant score by john williams  their future was different  one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon  and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  
when spielberg began work on that project  he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit  jaws  
together with other young directors of his  new hollywood  generation  like kauffman  carpenter  hill and millius  he exploited the great creative freedom of s  when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  
ironically  it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of  blockubuster  philosophy  
but in the mid s  many things were different  spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie  
although very personal  spielbergs screenplay was partly based on the book  ufo experience  by dr  j  allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww  
spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology  but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost  unmatched until the contemporary era of xfiles and the roswell anniversary  
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic uforelated incidents as the element of the plot  
the story begins with one of such incidents  team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u  s  navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight   
such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary  richard dreyfuss   power company worker from muncie  indiana  who later becomes obsessed with his experience  
because of his obsession he loses his job  family and sanity  but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler  melinda dillon   single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction  
in the meantime  the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u  s  government  in cooperation with the french  led by lacombe  francois truffaut  begin with the preparation for ultrasecret project  
when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary  he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area  
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions  
two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there  
spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects  
the slow  gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents   close encounters   is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale  
but  instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws  we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder  
throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big  magnificent and wonderful is about to happen  and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end  
the last sequence  with its  even in this age  impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull  would leave many mouths open  
one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism  
aliens  who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in sciencefiction cinema  are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful  
it is very ironic  when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story  howard hawks thing and byron haskins war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind  
spielbergs humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era  the only hint of the contemporary gloom is postwatergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public  
but  even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chainsmoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to xfiles and its more cynical and disturbing visions  
there lies the main  and probably the only flaw of this great picture  lack of conflict  and consequently  lack of drama  
the movie has few excitements or even action scenes  especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcocks north by northwest  but generally  almost everyone  neary  jillian  government  aliens  are the good guys  
despite such shortcomings  the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles  
richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary  yet nice guy  who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale  
melinda dillon was  on the other hand  nominated for  oscar  as a struggling mother  yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as nearys longsuffering wife ronnie  
apart from visual wonders of this film  spielbergs semiofficial composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music  this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot  and as the basis for his score  
the aliens  who are the main subject of this film  were visually very convincing  
too convincing  one of my acquaintances in the uforesearching circles said  
according to him  the depiction of extraterrestrials as greyskinned little people with big eyes was so accurate  that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos  
so  they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien  this time designed to be anything but the real life  
the result was e  t   for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times  yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts  
anyway  whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos  close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie  and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema
