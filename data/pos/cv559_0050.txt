every yearevery year at the festival  i wait for that film to come along  that one that just pulls me out of my seat  sticks its face up next to my nose  and roars  surprise   
into my bewildered visage  
its almost always a surprise  
it sure as niflheim was this time  
amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale  of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason  
and  in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film  it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale  where we roll our eyes occasionally  smirk to ourselves  and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a  boy  i wish that could happen  sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash  
another e  t  
another short circuit  
this film floored me  for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept  the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough  and presents itself well enough  to make it more of an american folk tale  with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time  
america has always had its mythical heros  its paul bunyans and john waynes  this film presents us with more general  but still universal  ideals  the honest  innocent children who have their own inner wisdom  the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage  honor  and love for their respective sport  the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding  but has the grit to get things done when they need doin  does the latter sound familiar    
amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters  but it never leaves you with the feeling that its artificial  that it stands behind glass  or that any sharp breezeor  more importantly  sharp thoughtwill shatter the wax facade of the panorama  
this is a very sturdy scenario  
the principals are always given dialogue  and always give performancesalways  it just blows me away   which made them seem real  yet enforces their particular mythic role  
the writerproducer  david field  seems to literally take all the  yeah  but in real life  this would have happen  thoughts you get in your head  sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading  in a stronger way then before  
astounding  
he uses obstacles to the plot to  enforce  it  
i am truly impressed  indeed  envious  with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay  its so very unusual  especially in a hollywood film  
i dont want to give too much away  but the basic premise is that chuck  joshua zuehlke   the little league pitcher  decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons  
his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete  a boston basketball player  alex english    amazing  grace smith  and  well  im leaving it at that because i wouldnt spoil this film for you for the world  
let me just say this  though  i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply  
i dont give a rats ass for the political pointofview this film expresses  one way or another  im recommending you go see this film because  and only because  its an excellent story  told with excellence  
no  i dont believe what happens in this film could happen in real life  while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted  i believe in careful negotiations  mutual verification  etc  screw what i think  
the point is  this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen  
this is the natural and moreall the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion  and a much better script to boot  
it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhoodand  more importantly  without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of selfconsciousness  
special kudos to  both zuehlke  a reallife little league pitcher who was picked for the part  and english  a forward for the denver nuggets  for their seamless personification of their characters  jamie lee curtis  who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazings manager and friend  william l  peterson  in a  big  change from his role in to live and die in l  a   as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it  and gregory peck  as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was  and who some numbskulls still probably think he is
