plot  a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesnt quite know what she wants out of life

she starts with the people around her  but when she suddenly falls for her own guy  she cant act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature  
critique  a clever  quirky  original french flick set in a picturesque paris  featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination  much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone  
this is a  feelgood  kind of movie  a fairy tale for grownups who are bummed out about life  
it doesnt pretend to be deep  it doesnt weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters  its basically just a  cute movie  in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward  with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions  and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year  a sham on so many different levels   you might as well slap this film up for consideration also  since its quite a bit better and much more original than the former   
one thing that this film isnt though  at least according to me  is the best film of the year  it was bestowed the honor of  best  in at least  different film festivals so far this year   
it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long  its a little over two hours but it felt even longer   with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters  all of whom werent as interesting as the lead  and a lot of indecisiveness from ms  amelie herself  which got frustrating  
thankfully  this film doesnt bog itself down with too much of that stuff  and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes  to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kindhearted french girl  
on the whole  its a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man  
the lead  audrey tautou  is perfect for the role  and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film  
unfortunately  the rest of the cast isnt as welldeveloped  and even though most of them are pretty appealing  a couple couldve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plotwise  by the films end  what happened to the guy in the caf  who was spying on his exgirlfriend the whole movie    
now i havent seen too many recent french films  i will admit  but if this is the kind of  scene  that theyre developing over in  le pays du vin   i wouldnt mind catching more of their flicks in the future  crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year  which i really liked ironically  that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz  who is the costar in this film   
granted  the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times  i speak and understand french also  but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head   especially since the films visuals were so intriguing that you just couldnt help but constantly gawk at them  but the general idea  the background music  the nifty french neighborhoods  the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the storyline from the start  were all very easy to appreciate  and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world  
in fact  id recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol time at the movie house  with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination  a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts  
and this guy directed alien  resurrection  
get outta here   
note  i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loveshates of everyone with exact mentions in the film  
it was very original  very well shot and very nostalgic  as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described  
good stuff  
wheres joblo coming from  
chocolat     crimson rivers     ghost world     like water for chocolate     o brother  where art thou     pay it forward     rushmore     woman on top
