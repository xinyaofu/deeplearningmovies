for a movie about discoera excess     comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late s and early s manhattan dance club  
think of it as a sort of  boogie nights  lite  where that similarlystructured and set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goingson and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift     leaves the kinkier details to your imagination  
it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter  but it thankfully never resorts to preaching  either  
in fact  were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment     would be about as feathery as the time periods popular female hairstyle  
studio  was a haven for the rich  famous and generally goodlooking before it closed its doors forever in   
inside  anything went and  we are told  everything did  
the films fictional main character is shane oshea  ryan phillippe  the jerky jock from  i know what you did last summer    a freshfaced yearold who dreams of venturing beyond the clubs velvet rope and coming facetoface with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines  
his wish comes true when studio  owner steve rubell  mike myers  spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in  and permits him passage  but not before he doffs his hideous shirt  of course  
once inside  shane becomes seduced by the clubs dizzying vortex of sex and drugs  
he has such a good time that he doesnt want to leave  so he seeks employment as a busboy  
he quickly becomes friends with greg  breckin meyer  and anita  salma hayek   a married couple who work along side of him  gregs a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio  bartender  while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own  
after rubbing elbows  among other things  with a renowned socialite  sela ward  and gaining the personal interest of rubell  shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of   
but fame doesnt come without a price  
    s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players  at a slim hourandahalf  the film is too short to take on such a multicharacter focus  and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act  
alleged lastminute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction  since    sometimes feels like its missing a scene here or there  
nowhere is this more apparent than in shanes relationship with soap opera actress julie black  neve campbell   a frequent studio  patron whom hes long admired from afar  
the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special  
that    works despite these limitations  then  is largely due to the competence and energy with which its assembled  
sure  its shallow  slick  sanitized portrait of a bygone age  and sure  weve seen the ragstoriches story gazillions of times  but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio  hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision  
the film boasts some fine comic creativity  the pinnacle of which is disco dottie   the wedding singer  s ellen dow   an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public  but slides up to shane behind s closed doors and asks for a  funky little treat   
the solid  sexy cast smooths out  if only while youre caught up in the film  any rough spots belonging to their alteregos or the plot  
newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat  he and campbell  as fetching as ever  look so good together its a shame their subplot goes nowhere  
meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in  clueless   he was the stoner with the jokersmile   while hayek simply sizzles  especially when leading a dance class with the mantra   one  two  three  attitude   
sherry stringfield  unidentifiable under big s hair  takes on her first bigscreen gig since she left  er  as rubells accountant  but shes criminally underused  
as the droopyeyed  drugaddled steve rubell  myers is worth the price of admission alone  
when hes not playing the life of the party  the ex  saturday night live  comedian strips away all of rubells confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty  unhappy life with exorbitance  its a moment worthy of pity when  while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening  he attempts to seduce one of his employees  
and while his performance is largely serious  myers mixes the empathy with a delicate  austin powers  esque wink  thus keeping consistent with    s overall feel  gaudy  largerthanlife and satisfyingly ornamental  not unlike a giant disco ball
