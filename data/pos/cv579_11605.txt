in   an insiders look at a scandalridden run for the democratic presidential nomination  closely based on clintons  campaign  was written anonymously  former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship   
now  the book  primary colors  has been made into a movie  directed by mike nichols  and  in light of recent presidential scandals  seems to be more relevant than ever  
but the film is more than a diatribe against  or a paean in praise of  the president  
it is a fascinating look at the political machinery  and the ethical quagmire  that surround modern politics  
jack stanton  john travolta  is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination  
he is charismatic  but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign  and strains his relationship with his wife  susan  emma thompson   
the film is told from the point of view of henry burton  adrian lester   grandson of a civil rights leader  who is swept away by stantons ideals and helps to organize the campaign  
he joins political strategist richard jemmons  billy bob thornton  looking an awful lot like james carville   and campaign advisor daisy green  maura tierney   
governor stantons past repeatedly pops up to haunt him  a fact that his chief rival  lawrence harris  kevin cooney   consistently uses to his advantage  
to help clean up the stanton campaign  jack and susan bring in an old friend  libby  the dustbuster  holden  kathy bates   
the acting throughout primary colors is superb  
it would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone  
she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance  
travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton  although his accent does stray a little  
emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who cant let anything show that might hurt the presidential run  
the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other  or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom  
primary colors treads lightly on this issue  
though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat  and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans  the movie touches on few actual political issues  
in fact  most of the  bad guys  are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house  
rather than issues  the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control  
although the film strays into some obviously nonclinton territory  it is difficult to completely separate it from reality  particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the presidents current troubles   
primary colors chief problem is its length  
it runs about  minutes too long  
there are some scenes which could have easily been cut  
for example  midway through the film  the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists  
the scenes only apparent purpose is to establish stantons character  which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film  
the extra length isnt long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying  but it mars an otherwise excellent film  
republicans  democrats  and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors  
its a funny  and at some times shocking  look at the modern political process
