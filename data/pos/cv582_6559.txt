note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
milos formans first film since the illfated valmont  columbias the people vs  
larry flynt  is a vastly entertaining  if not particularly enlightening  biopic of hustler publisher and selfmade millionaire larry flynt  who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late s and early s  
the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order  we open with young and dirtpoor larry flynt and his brother jimmy  peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky  
cut to forward in time  where the two flynt brothers  now young men  are running the struggling hustler gogo clubs in cincinnati  
the strip clubs are in a dire financial state  and in a lastditch effort to salvage the operations  flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter  
this evolved into the adult periodical hustler magazine  creating larry flynt a vast financial empire  and the rest is history  
what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material  and who railed and preached against him  flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt  and his driven  singleminded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression  regardless of personal cost  
the people vs  
larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynts true love  althea leasure  whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries  and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations  
considering the serious nature of the films theme  the importance of the united states first amendment  the people vs  
larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully lighthearted and humourous  
much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynts outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances  some of his chosen apparel is hilarious  and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points  such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity  
the films focus is on the flynts many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech  but the heart of the people vs  
larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea  
larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff  harsh  and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues  but with althea  we see his loving  affectionate side  
theres a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking  
ultimately  the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors  but from the strength of flynt and altheas love for each other  
woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a careertopping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt  
harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience  and a very compelling protagonist for the film  
courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn  completely raw and impulsive  
its a very solid performance  brash and naturalistic  and love is extremely compelling  its difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen  and her chemistry with harrelson is deadon  
edward norton  as flynts straight  levelheaded lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier costars in the people vs  
larry flynt  much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes  but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film  
one can sense the frustration that nortons character feels when harrelsons freetalking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind  and this results in a heightened emotional punch when nortons isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges  
milos forman keeps the film moving  although it runs over two hours  it never drags  and his direction of the film is very effective  eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic  
theres also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot  which is both clever and extremely entertaining  
two minor quibbles with the film  it certainly seems like the people vs  
larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme  with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech  
consequently  the first thirty minutes of the film  introducing and setting up the characters  seem unduly rushed  perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting  but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion  
it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters  the film clearly shows what flynt  althea  isaacman  and rev  jerry faldwell did  and on a superficial level some of their motivations  but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level  
for example  why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton  president carters sister  to be bornagain is a mystery to me  
then again  perhaps it was to him as well  
these two points dont detract greatly from the film  
the people vs  
larry flynt is certainly among the very best studioreleased films of   and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression  and as a touching love story
