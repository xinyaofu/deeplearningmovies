until i saw the night of the hunter  it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie  
forget the others and the deep end  which veered toward strained dramatics   the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie ive seen so far this year  
even though the movie is nearly  years old and theres a not drop of blood to be seen  
luckily  the night of the hunter  charles laughtons first and final directing gig  has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being rereleased in october   
so  theres still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place  
robert mitchum stars as harry powell  a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash  
his newest target is young mother willa harper  shelley winters   whose murderer husband ben  peter graves  has hidden    somewhere  
powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs  harper after hes released and ben is hanged  
but finding the money isnt easy for powell  who must contend with his stepchildren  billy chapin and sally jane bruce   who know where the money is  but arent telling  
the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments  thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time  
how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies  
what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin  
  no  im not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem   
yes  there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter  
powells  love  and  hate  knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing  remember radio raheem    
and powells black suit  with black tie and white shirt  could have shaped quentin tarantinos early visual style  
seeing the night of the hunter for the first time  i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact  
you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club  
he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears  
hes like the senior class president with an evil streak  
if i ever need to stay awake  ill just picture him crooning   leaning    
leaning      
any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah  
and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez  who create a series of haunting  surreal shadowy images over the rural depressionera backdrop  
its a testament to both men that theyre able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline  kids harassed by evil guardians  by sticking to the old maxim that were more scared by what we dont see  
screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters  the drunk birdie  james gleason  whos haunted by his wife  and the spoons  evelyn varden and walt spoon  whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act  
the only lapse is the movies third act  when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly  biblereading mrs  cooper  lillian gish   
her showdown with powell is memorable  a battle done with dueling hymns  
however  the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone  but its still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun  
do yourself favor and dont miss this if it comes to a nearby theater  
note  a series of revealing  but overlong  outtakes preceded the movie  
the highlights included the legendary laughton  who sounds eerily like mr  pitt from seinfeld  running winters lines with mitchum  and the adorable  tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile  
hours more of such footage exists  as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling  
screened as part of the  new york film festival retrospectives  feature story coming soon
