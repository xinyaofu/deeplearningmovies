whenever writerdirector robert altman works in a specific genre  he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms  
he made the west dirty in  mccabe and mrs  miller      he parodied hardboiled detective stories in  the long goodbye      and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with  popeye      
the same holds true for his most recent film   the gingerbread man   which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years  the john grisham movie  
by the time  the gingerbread man  was completed  there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham  
theres no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise  matthew mcconaughey  chris odonnell or matt damon  and it doesnt feature a great showdown in a courtroom  
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession   the gingerbread man  is a rainsoaked  southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters  a twisting plot line  black humor  a somewhat bleak ending  and even altmans trademark fullfrontal female nudity  
the central character of the film is rick magruder  who is unlike any of grishams other lawyer heroes  
he is older  experienced  and rich  he drives a cherryred    mercedes that never gets dirty  even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah  georgia  where the story unfolds  
rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife  leeanne  famke janssen   and he rarely gets to see his two children  jeff  jesse james  and libby  mae whitman   
a reason is never given for the divorce  but it isnt hard to surmise that ricks womanizing had a large part in it  
whenever hes late to pick up the kids on his visitation days  leeanne always assumes its because hes been  screwing around   
after an office party celebrating another of his court victories  he hasnt lost in eight years   rick becomes involved with mallory doss  embeth davidtz   one of the catering waitresses  
he drives her home because her car has been stolen  and they end up in bed together  
rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father  dixon doss  robert duvall   a grungy  stringy  barefooted old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers  
it was actually dixon who stole her car that night  and when rick asks why  mallory replies that he always does  weird  stuff like that  
as another character puts it  dixon is  a few beers short of sixpack   
rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency  
he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell  a private investigator friend  robert downey jr    and testimony from mallorys begrudging exhusband  pete randle  tom berenger   
dixon is put in a mental hospital  but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out  
from there  the story delves into kidnapping  murder  doublecrossing  and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action  
altmans cinematographer  changwei gu  gives the film a dark  soaked look  
if it isnt nighttime  at least its raining  
gu shoots the interiors  which are almost all dark wood paneling  with a minimum of light  
a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods  which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability  
in the city there is danger enough  but when rick has to venture into the woods  you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world  
altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre  from westerns to epic dramas to comedies  
but  no matter what the genre  he is always sure to give it the altman stamp  which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings  
  the gingerbread man  is no different  although his style is much more restrained here  
however  without those little touches  the film could have easily slumped into a routine actionthriller  
a great deal of the credit for the films success can be given to the actors  especially branagh  who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction  
here  the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl  while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic  
rick is an extremely flawed man  but branaugh brings real humanity to his character  
without it  the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling ricks pain and frustration  
the supporting actors also put in fine performances  including embeth davidtz  who is probably best known for her heartbreaking role as the jewish maid in  schindlers list      
tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief  and robert duvall spends most of his onscreen time just looking weird  
it doesnt seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue  but watch him closely during the films one courtroom scene  his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language  and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing  
while  the gingerbread man  isnt in league with altmans greatest works like  nashville     or  the player      it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking  which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career  
some critics love to stamp films like this as  commercial   as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and dont make money  
altman has done something much better  he took what could have been a generic movie  and by investing artistry and effort  he made it into something more
