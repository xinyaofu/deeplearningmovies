  remember what the mpaa says  horrific and deplorable violence is ok as long as you dont say any naughty words

filmmakers jump on reallife controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell  
the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up  and already someones made a movie about it  and its not  thank god  a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy  
instead we get a sharp  biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed  
based on a popular  and controversial  cable tv show  south park  bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights  
the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian rrated movie and learn some naughty words  
when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms  they decide to  blame canada   wage war against the neighbor country and execute  terrence and phillip   the flatulent actors in the obscene film  
the kids form an alliance they name  la resistance   with the accent on the third syllable of  resistance   to save their favorite thespians  in a hilarious spoof of  tribute to   
les mis  rables  
in a subplot  one of the characters  kenny  who else   
dies and goes to hell where he meets satan  
satan and saddam hussein are lovers  you see  
satan is a benevolent soul  while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex  
apparently  too  if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth  
aside from being a brilliant satire  south park is also an allstopsout musical  with unforgettable numbers like  shut your f    ing face uncle f    er  and  cartmans mom is a big fat bitch   
almost invariably its funny stuff  often juvenile but always funny  
the same can be said for the rest of the movie  its intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner  i  e  
toilet humor  endless profanity  etc    
not that theres anything wrong with that  vulgarity  when done right  is my bag  baby  
trey parker and matt stone  the twentysomethings behind the film and the show  paint a bullseye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it  
cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaas rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities arent uttered  the auteurs throw some nasty oneliner insults their way  
the ratingsaplenty association isnt the only target of this unsparing banter  people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game  with the  blame canada  plot being a notsocheap shot at them  
the distinctively lowtech  cardboard  animation is oddly effective  even more so than the state of the art  deep canvas  technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan  
its more pleasant to look at  less intimidating up on the screen  and most importantly it doesnt detract from the films concept as much as disneys admirably aweinspiring work does  
the shows popularity has been waning as of late  and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings  
perhaps not  
having seen the show on numerous occasions  i can say that its not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie  
the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years  
parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask  must the show go on
