i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one  folks  
i loved the wedding singer  
but it gets worse  
if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence  
  
  
hell  same paragraph as the wedding singer  im bound to be lynched  
well lynch me then  because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory  with titanic as the only exception  
right away  youre ready to discount my review  arent you  
youre thinking that i cant possibly know what im talking about  
after all  this is adam sandler right    
well  theres more  
  
  
i actually got choked up  and more than once  
yes  the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes  
but before you shrug me off as an imbecile  i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself  
the wedding singer is the story of robby hart  sandler   a  rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so  
but when his own wedding results in a noshow for the bride  angela featherstone as linda   robby begins to reexamine his life  and wonder why true love doesnt exist for people like him  
in the process of performing at these receptions  robby meets a waitress named julia  played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore  whose reputation is anything but this character  
julia too is engaged  and when robby finds himself without a wife  his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding  seeing as how her fiance  the  miami vice  loving glenn  matthew glave   doesnt seem all that interested  
as the time goes by  we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding  hes merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup  something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women  
its obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her  but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for  
this isnt sleepless in seattle  but id actually compare it to that before id compare it to happy gilmore  
while the wedding singer maintains some of that postsnl cornball humor  its sincerity and charm carry it a very  very long way  
sandler is great in his role  and yes  if you allow it  you can take him seriously  
barrymore seems perfect along side him  and although the two more likely represent genx moronism and partygirl ditzism  respectively   the two go together like bread and butter as a mideighties couple  
one scene in particular  where julia ponders the future in a mirror  is so well done  i was on the verge of tears  
unfortunately  sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a nobrainer  but its got so much surprise substance packed inside that im encouraging everyone to go see it  
in fact  the entire theater applauded when the film ended  and laughs were so consistent  some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar  
the  setting was milked for everything it was worth  and for those of us that are old enough to remember it  it was a bodacious trip back  and done very well   
sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm  or is it anticharm    
while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit  grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars  
its hilarious  and its touching  
its got that great cheezy humor  but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected  
this is one to see again and again  
is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of   
my  magic ball  predicts it is certain
