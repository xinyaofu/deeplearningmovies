in  magic town   jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a  perfect  town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only polltakers care about  
however  as time progresses  and he finds himself falling in love with the town  and a woman   he begins to see that what hes doing is wrong  
the plot is standard stuff  but thats not important  
in a film like this  its the calibre of the actors that make or break it  
obviously  since stewart stars  thats practically a nonissue  
hes great in the film  as usual  
theres just something about him that always manages to be endearing  even when hes deceiving the town folk  
youre always on his side  and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition  
the film was directed by a longtime frank capra scriptwriter  and it shows  
this is the type of feelgood picture that capra is famous for  
by the time  the end  shows up on screen  everything has been wrapped up very nicely  
there are no loose ends  and virtually every character gets a happy ending  those that deserve one  anyway   
in this age of cynicism  its refreshing to see a movie so upbeat  
  magic town  is a delightfully entertaining motion picture  
if you believe all old movies are slowpaced  youd be welladvised to check this one out
