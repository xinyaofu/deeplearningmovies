kevin smith is like a big kid  
his humor is that of a sophisticated juveniles  
he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books  having also written a few  
he also has a cult following  mostly composed of teenagers  college students  and smiths own fellow adolescentminded grownups  
smith is hilarious in person and in writing  but when he tries to be earnest and moralize  that is when he goes wrong  
kevin smith is a better writer than director  and hell be the first to tell you that  
that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavyhanded  
great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them  
this was true in the overrated chasing amy  and it is true for dogma as well  
that is not to say smiths message is a bad one  
in dogma  smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and gods desires is superior to anyone elses  
basically  dogmatism is bad  
changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible  and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight  they also know what is best for you  whether you like it or not  
this is not exactly a new message in movies  see inherit the wind   but i have no problems with recycling old ones  particularly since dogmas protesters are proving smiths point  
smiths own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book  
but this is smiths personality  and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible  or koran  etc   correctly  or if there even is a correctly  and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns  
the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany  linda fiorentino  being chosen by voice of god  metatron  alan rickman   to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels  bartleby  ben affleck  and angel of death  loki  matt damon   
along the way  forgotten thirteenth apostle  rufus  chris rock   stripper muse serendipity  salma hayek   and slacker duo jay and silent bob  jason mewes and kevin smith himself  come to bethanys aid  
fallen muse  azrael  jason lee   proves to be the behindthescenes manipulator for all the chicanery  
the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smiths points  and in itself  has little dramatic momentum  
among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman  jesus was black  and the bible was written by a bunch of racist  misogynistic white men  
of course  kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself  
they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic  
smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie  
when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes  smith thought it might give validation to protesters claims that the film was sacrilegious  but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke  
the films humor is uneven  
some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burningbush kind of entrance  
but many of the films jokes just bomb  as in virtually anything involving salma hayeks serendipity  
also  some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away  
still  smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace  
among the actors  fiorentino and rickman stand out by far  
fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight  
damon and affleck are fairly lackluster  
rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith  
but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob  who recur in all of smiths movies  are much more in line with smiths brand of humor  
bud cort  george carlin  janeane garofalo  guinevere turner  and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances
