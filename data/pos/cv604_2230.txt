brian depalma needs a hit  really  badly  
since scoring big with the untouchables in   depalma has seen casualties of war  raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames  
consequently  it would be easy enough to consider carlitos way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma  reteaming with al pacino  scarface  and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes  
it doesnt hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn  
carlitos way  while hampered by depalmas characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism  is a truly tense and engrossing drama  
carlito brigante  pacino  is a lifelong criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance  
in   carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality  
he declares himself reformed  tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas  
among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld  penn   carlitos crooked attorney and childhood friend  and bodyguard pachanga  luis guzman   
carlito rediscovers old flame gail  penelope ann miller   and seems ready to retire in peace  
old ways die hard  though  and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he cant seem to shake  
carlitos way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film  
in the first  carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat  the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station  
both highlight depalmas gift for choreographed mayhem  and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely  
yet for all the viscera  i found the character study even more compelling  
carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him  an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit  
but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera  theres more of an immediacy to carlitos way  an everpresent sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion  
you sense that theres no way  after so many years  that carlito can stay out of trouble  
indeed  he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart   you dont get reformed  you just run out of wind   
pacino captures carlitos dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy  
sean penn is even better  turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld  
a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys  kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder  
he could have been simply pathetic  a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league  but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct  
he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink  making the moment he goes over quite jolting  
as compelling as the narrative is  viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu  
depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors  this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas  
he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms  like a  degree swing around a kiss  vertigo via body double  and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables  
from a story standpoint  theres an obligatory love story with a cliched longsuffering girlfriend character  
penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesnt do anything new with the role  and eventually she becomes just a distraction  never integrated fully enough into the story  
still  its easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid  
the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention  one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldnt break  
carlitos way plays like a tragic novel  deliberate  confident and powerful  
those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well rewarded
