a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings  
a prime example of this is s  things i hate about you  which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school  
less successful was last years adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp  here the setting was the corporate world of new york  
now comes o  a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeares tragedies  
like  things i hate about you  the stage is a high school  a private prep school where odin james  mekhi phifer  is the oncourt general  the basketball teams standout player  
julia stiles  featured in  things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawkes hamlet  plays desi brable  odins girlfriend  whose father also happens to be dean of the institution  
josh hartnett  pearl harbor  is on hand for the villainy  playing the scheming hugo  who sets the tragic wheels in motion  
o was actually filmed a couple of years ago  but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy  
the movie  directed by tim blake nelson  best known for his costarring role in o brother  where art thou  
 and written by brad kaaya  is very grim  
an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits  
and that is how it should be  
of all of shakespeares tragedies  othello is the most harrowing  not because of any body count  but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago  whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery  
kaayas profanefilled script  after all  these are high school kids  does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts  
the young man considers himself the basketball teams prime utility man who does a little bit of everything  pass  shoot  rebound  but is constantly in the shadow of odin  
plus his father  the teams coach  played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen  showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood  
the script follows the familiar lines of the classic  
hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desis fidelity  eroding the stars confidence in those he considers closest to him  affecting both his relationships and his game  
it all ends in blood  of course  which is why the movie was originally shelved  
the performances in o vary  
phifer is at first cocky and selfassured  emotions he handles with ease  
he also does quite well displaying odins darker side  his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution  his growing distrust of those he loved  his rage and the erosion of his belief system  
hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit  turning friend against friend  and lover against lover  
stiles seems a bit stilted  but occasionally also rises to the occasion  moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight  
the film does contain a few missteps  a subplot involving hugos theft of the school mascot is left hanging  
also desis actions concerning michael  andrew keegan   odins former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugos machinations  is puzzling  
why she would continually be seen with michael  however innocent the circumstances  when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back  
it is irrational  
but these are minor carpings  
overall  o is a stylish and faithful adaptation  
if nothing else  it may encourage some people to read the original text  and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature
