originally launched in   this popular film was reintroduced in  to a whole new generation of moviegoers  
based on the mighty successful musical from broadway  grease was followed in  with the less stellar grease        
starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles  
plot  highschool musical set in the s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the tbirds  travolta  and the innocent and pure sandy olsen  newtonjohn  from australia  
the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song  dance and humour  
critique  funloving  energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler  
this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the s  with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers  
admittedly  i am somewhat biased in this opinion  since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth  grease was one of schmoes first bigscreen experiences  and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubblegum card collection   and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time  
but apart from the nostalgic vibe  i was still extremely impressed by this film  as it continued to amuse me  despite my previous dozen or so viewings  
this film took john travolta from a dimwitted  sweathog  on tvs welcome back kotter  and transformed him into a moviestar of spectacular proportions  saturday night fever      in  confirmed that sudden popularity   
unfortunately for the rest of the cast  his popularity was not terribly contagious  despite their effective showings in this classic movie  
on the down side  some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off  like when sandy sings about  drinking lemonade  and  staying out until   with danny in  summer nights    and the plot isnt exactly the most elaborate storyline ever created  but despite these small reservations  this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid  minute running time  and believe me    i 
am not a fan of the musicals     
make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player  as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the films absolute highlights  
and dont forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards  so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever youre feeling a little blue  
little known facts  henry winkler  of tvs happy days fonzie fame  turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career  
both travolta and conaway were smitten by newtonjohn during the filming of this picture  
conaway eventually bowed out of the woofest  and married newtonjohns sister a year later  divorced after five years
