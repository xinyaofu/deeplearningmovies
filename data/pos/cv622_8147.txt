did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet  
or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extraterrestrial  
i used to think that about my th grade english teacher  ms  carey  
but after seeing this movie  they may have confirmed my suspicions  
as the story goes  at any time  there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth  
the men in black  mib  are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens  guardians of our beloved planet from nastytempered aliens  and secret service to the stars  
based in new york city  where weird is the norm   the mib organization gives human form to our spacefaring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed  
but to enforce the laws of earth  the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast  
they carry otherworldly technology to erase peoples shortterm memory when common folk see the mib in action  
and their best leads on cosmic thingsgoneawry are the supermarket tabloids  
little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v  evil going on in the depths of space  
one of the aliensashuman on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious  
it holds the key  literally  to universal peace  
a giant cockroachlike alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this key  
in the wrong alien hands  flippers  
mandibles  
tentacles    it can be used as a weapon  
therefore  it must be recovered and returned to its rightful owners  
otherwise  to ensure universal safety  earth will be destroyed  along with the key  
now  its the mib who must prevent this catastrophe  
the mib agents on the case are  k   played by tommy lee jones  
he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore  
the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes  
he is accompanied by a flippant rookie   j   played by will smith  
but  despite this shootemup  protectearthfromdestruction premise  this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie  
and  this isnt an independence day knockoff  
rather  this is a stylishly offbeat scifi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies  that there are real aliens that live here  and that the government does its darndest to cover them up  
but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe  there must be some kind of earthhangsinthebalance scenario  
yet  this movie is very appealing  
the abundance of wierdness  talking aliens  peewee atomizers  a mortician who lives for her work  and lots of yucky bugs and slimesplattering galore   is played straight  like as if this were normal  of course  we are in nyc   
it gives it a deadpan feel  which makes it all the more funnier and odder  
jones plays the venerable seenitall agent with seriousness and maturity  
smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones straight man routine  
they click like dorothys ruby red shoes  
the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld  the addams family   
this guy has a knack for gothic comedy  and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen  
and  an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors  
the story moves well  and before you know it  the end credits are already rolling  
the result is  minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs  aaaahhhs and wows  
let the men in black protect and color your world
