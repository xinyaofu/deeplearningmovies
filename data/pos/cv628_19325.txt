title  tarzan beautiful to look at  easy to follow  
review  disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story  
the basic premise is the same as every other tarzan story  a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding  or even noticing  that hes human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends  
the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala  voiced by glen close   a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism  
her mate  kerchak  henriksen   is a mean  conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzans extended family  
he refuses to acknowledge tarzan  voiced by alex d  linz during the childhood scenes  as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous  wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts  
i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and its funny how the adults fail to comprehend this  
later  as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a fullgrown man  voiced by goldwyn   he is encounter by a party of three humans from england  jane porter  driver   a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist  her father prof  archimedes q  porter  voiced by nigel hawthorne  who is also a scientist  and their slick and cunning  yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton  blessed   
its easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesnt seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for childrens enjoyment  
sure theres a lot of cliche stuff here  like claytons smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane  the goofy supporting characters  voiced by rosie odonnell in full brooklyn accent   and wayne knight  hello newman     
theres also a lot of fun action such as tarzans swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks  
its just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks  those mcdonalds commercials really prove this point   
ultimately  you get exactly out of tarzan what you expect    
and i mean that as a compliment  so have high expectations  
pros  animation and sound are a feast for the senses  story is lighthearted  breezy and not dumbeddown  no stupid singalong songs to get stuck in your head  
cons  surprisingly violent  should have been rated pg  
young children may not understand some of the more adult themes  parents  be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way   
running time is a bit short  
would you recommend this to friends  
not to my friends  but to the moviegoing public i would  
score  or with no  rating
