casting  doogie howser  star neil patrick harris as mindreading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of  starship troopers   a hugely entertaining  megabudgeted scifi yarn directed by paul verhoeven  whos making quite a recovery from his  gstring epic  showgirls   
sure   starship troopers  qualifies as cinematic junk food  but thats forgivable when the junk food is this tasty  
everyone needs a highcalorie changeofpace from falls onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait  and  troopers  does the job admirably despite its flaws  
for its first hour   starship troopers  plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of  saved by the bell  and  g  i  
jane   
in the distant years ahead  high school grad johnny rico  casper van dien  signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen  denise richards   he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot  so the couple is broken up  
but theres temptation awaiting both of them  johnnys is in the form of an old friend  dina meyer  also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush  while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor  patrick muldoon   
personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final  minutes  when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america  killing johnnys parents and destroying his home  
our weakening  lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry  and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens home planet  where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good  
but the enemy is far smarter  more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for  and after an initial walloping  they must reexamine their strategy  
the exposition  played like a futuristic soap opera  is silly  but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans  
once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous  but never boring  training sessions   starship troopers  really kicks into high gear  
its last half is all gruesomely violent action  a fury of severed limbs  decapitations  disembowelments  brain removal  explosions and other joltinducers that are really going to please the  and yearold boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly rrated show  
the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected  and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic  imaginative high point  
its nice to see intergalactic beasties that arent too derivative of the titular menace from  alien   
these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights  especially the arachnids  a spiderscorpioncrab combo thats all sharp talons and even sharper legs  
they attack in packs of hundreds  and its a funny  scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl  jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined  gooey mess  
it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind  ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot   these sequences of insect warfare are numerous  bloody and immensely satisfying  
the occasional dramatic moments  one cast members death  the final resolution to johnnys love triangle  are botched  a testament to how  starship troopers  fails to create any strong  outstanding characters  
these bland kenandbarbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arms length  but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la  star wars   where even the slightest aliens had definite personality  
the acting is decent  but never spectacular   most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory  smallish roles on  beverly hills   andor  melrose place   and it occasionally shows  
van dien  for example  is limited but perfectly likeable  
in smaller parts are the aforementioned neil patrick harris as johnnys best friend and jake busey  garys son  as johnnys sidekick  the latter excels at playing creeps  see  the frighteners  or  contact   but seems offkilter as a second banana  
  starship troopers  is based on the novel by robert heinlein  a scifi writer who hasnt exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with s howler  the puppet masters   
but the overall familiarity to the  alien  trilogy  and the promise of great gobs of gore  could act as a crowddrawer  
its own possible influence  however  might well work against it when the franchise continuation  alien  resurrection  opens in a few weeks  
we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall
