if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child  would you do it  
  gattaca  is a film which presents a future where society has answered  yes  to this question  but then ponders if this was actually the right decision  
  gattaca  came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature  the lovable dolly the sheep  and with this in mind  the film only becomes more frightening  
the way the realm of genetics is heading  it may only take a couple decades until the future  gattaca  presents becomes true  
contrary to the misleading trailers   gattaca  is not a scifi thriller  in the way that theres lots of murder  hitchcockian suspense  and chase scenes  
this is a quiet  sad film about intelligent theories  
in fact  the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley  the latter whos novel  brave new world  featured genetically engineered children   
its a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia  which is exactly what  gattaca  presents    and the main reason i dug it so much  
the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman  ethan hawke   a man with high hopes but a  chance of heart problems  and a prospected life span of around  years  
as a child  he was put down because of the threats of genetics  while his younger genetically perfect brother  anton  loren dean   was promised whatever his heart desired  
vincent yearns to be an astronaut  but when he gets a job at a giant space company  its as a janitor  ernest borgnine plays his boss    
but one day  he finds out that its probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist  or something   german   wings   tony shalhoub  who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in    men in black    a life less ordinary       whos client is a genetically perfect man  jerome morrow  jude law   who has unfortunately been crippled  
fortunately  though  theres no record of the accident  and hes willing to give someone else his life  
since vincent looks a bit like him    
after a couple alterations  some minor  some really major   he has donned the life of jerome  and is doing his job  
there  he meets a genetically imperfect woman  irene  uma thurman  whos genetically perfect in real life anyway  hee hee   and the two begin a kind of relationship  albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a mans stats are  
however  a murder of a highlevel worker at his office is killed  and one of vincentjeromes eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semiwily inspector  hugo   alan arkin   and none other than vincents long lost brother  anton  who hasnt seen him since they were teenagers  
we know vincentjerome didnt do it  but with his older picture being posted everywhere  not only vincentjeromes in trouble  but also the real jerome  whos as much in it as he is  
however  there isnt many big suspense set pieces  which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in  the film would lose its message and descend into just being a scifi thriller a la william gibson  
the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin  
while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening  there are no big distractions from the point of the film  much to the dismay of commercial audiences  
what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created  
irene has no real spunk in her life  and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people  
and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man  claiming that his accident was really no accident  
what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that  and the ending is shocking as its a definite work of dystopian propaganda  but doesnt have the down ending of other works of this kind  
the production design of this film is probably the best ive seen this year  its stunning  very pleasing to the eye  but still very cold  
since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement  the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity  and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery  
and the sequence of all the highlevel workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliamesque feel to it  showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombielike life  
the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy  
the acting from everyone is great  with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance  and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway  interesting pointless fact  uma and ethan started dating after this film  and currently she is pregnant with his child   
but the best performance belongs to jude law  who steals every scene hes in  and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden  
i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child  but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something im not sure of  
  gattaca  warns us not to go any farther  chiefly because well create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy  and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are  
and when i see a possible future featuring a fingered piano player  well folks  that just creeps me out
