plot  during a week span in london in the fall of   jack the ripper  a man whose identity was never uncovered  committed five ritualistic  grisly murders of prostitutes  
this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the centuryold mystery  
critique  awesome  
i love dark movies  i love stylish movies  i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp    so 
yes  i really dug this movie  
the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance  out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously  and this movie  my friends    is 
very serious  
in fact  its also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell  
it aint for the kids  ill tell you that much  
and if any of those recent hack directors of twobit screamesque slasher flicks want some advice on effective  kill scenes   do not look any further  because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner  especially when compared to their generic sliceanddice contrivances  
in fact  most of this films structure is very creative  the actors  all solid  the atmosphere and  feel  of the picture  remarkably real  gotta love those  unfortunates    and the descent into darkness  well honed by the filmmakers  
you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time  
but its also an impressive mystery film  based on the truelife tale of jack the ripper  a man whose identity was never discovered  
the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel  from hell  written by alan moore and presents a compelling story  which despite being a little oliver stoneish  did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely  and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem  sexual depravity  drug usage  insanity  murders and love  
yes  the brothers even managed to slip a little  love  story in here  and despite not truly being developed  i guess it couldve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already  
thats right  theres no real need to put any  romance  in a film about a mass murderer  
but that aside  you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp  who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities  to center this movie all the way through  
sure  hes just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow  but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one  
i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film  i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie  but she was fine  and how little the dreamsfantasies of depps character had to do with the films development  from what i had seen in the trailer  i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story  but thankfully  it wasnt   
on the downside  the film doesnt really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development  
but then again  a story about the most mysterious serial killer of alltime is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement  
i mean  the less i knew about each person  the more suspicious i became of each ones motives  reasons  etc    
in fact  i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end  and that was in part  due to the distance to which id been held from the films characters    or 
am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention  
perhaps  
overall  this is an extremely creepy production  with glorious cinematography  reminiscent of coppolas dracula and burtons sleepy hollow   a grim score and solid acting  
but its not for everyone  
some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events  and even though the murders arent shown as graphically as you might think  theres enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors  
but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable  gothic atmosphere  and this flick is just that and plenty more  
and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the rippers haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon    brrrrr  
wheres joblo coming from  
the crow     dark city     dracula     jfk     the nightmare before christmas     the ninth gate     the others     quills     shadow of the vampire     sleepy hollow
