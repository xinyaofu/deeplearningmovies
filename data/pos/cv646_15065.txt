vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element  substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject  but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents  
and  unlike any of the more outlandish myths  the vampire holds some realworld probability  one study claims    bloodsuckers exist worldwide  and places  in los angeles   
but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys  john carpenter would like to remind us that they are  and always have been  a truly frightening element of the thriller genre  
and remind us he does in his latest film  vampires  
there was some question  as halloween weekend approached  of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinemas immensely successful blade  released in august  
the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue  and dont even agree on some basic points of the slaying method  
  for instance  blades main weapons are silver and garlic  whereas main character jack crows technique is a wooden stake to the heart   
blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization  while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate  
both have their advantages  and here  carpenters style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered  
when its all said and done  though  the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish  the level for gore is indeed set to maximum  
this time  our hero is vaticansponsored slayer jack crow  james woods   
hes a cynical  battleworn veteran  and the best of his bunch  
he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest  and after exterminating a nest one night  they run up against a supervampire  termed a  master   named valek  thomas ian griffith   
valek kills all of jacks team except for his partner  tony montoya  daniel baldwin   and as the two regroup  they learn that valek is the original vampire  now over six hundred years old  
apparently  valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime  
so with the aid of a priest named adam  tim guinee  and a bitten hooker  sheryl lee  as bait  they track valek down for the final confrontation  
the script for vampires  written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel  is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year  
crow  in particular  is a fun source of oneliners  and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism  
baldwin  lee  and guinee are all fine supports  adding to the character pool  but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffiths bad guy  
griffiths intense expression is perfect for the role  and the only downside is that hes got to talk sometime  
luckily  hes got few lines  and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance  
all said  fans will surely be impressed by this picture  and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one  
certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters
