james cmaerons breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok  
for those of you who do not know the plot  in  machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race  
human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed  
however  some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor  
to stop connor  the machines send a terminator  arnold schwarzenegger  back to  to murder connors mother  sara  linda hamilton   and thus prevent connor from ever being born  
in response  the humans send a protector  kyle reese  played by michael biehn  
images of machines and of humans reliance on machines dominate the film  
even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of  will become the ruthless hunter killers of   humans continue to use the machines  
in the climax of star wars  luke relies on the force alonehis own spiritual powerto destroy the death star  
in the terminator  however  sara must use another machinea giant hydraulic pressto vanquish her enemy  
cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapableand hes not happy about it  
unabated technological growth brings about the terminators other obsession  the apocalypse  
we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon  thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la  
children watch the flames in a burning television  
when the terminator arrives in  an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him  
even though the  future is not set   there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie  the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence  
all sara can do is await it  
  cameron doesnt wimp out like he does in terminator   
the end of the world is the human races own fault  too  
after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place  
back in   when the cold war was still in full effect  the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war  another obsession of camerons   
these days  one can read a criticism of machinelike behavior in humans  
true  humanizing touches are put into paul winfields and lance henriksens detective characters  but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected  
cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in  la  
from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done  
arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonistunstoppable  merciless  obdurate  
we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzeneggers later works  eg  commando   but fear him  
cameron and hurds script basically depicts a one hour and fortyfive minute chase  taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot  
while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for  there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reeses intentions  
cameron directs the film at a rapid  kinetic pace  
either the camera is moving or something within the frame is movingusually both occurs  
the violence is not particularly graphic  temple of dooms heartpull scene outgrosses the terminators   but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective  
for a low budget film  the terminators special effects and art direction  especially in  la  are remarkably well done  
special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton  
it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen  
one thing that doesnt hold up after all the years  however  is linda hamiltons hairdo
