i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didnt need a sequel  
beloved by kids and their parents  respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs  that first movie remains a landmark of recent history  the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzledazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting  
if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game  toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions  and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply   it didnt show  and as distributor and partowner of the property  at least it had a piece of the action  
toy story  was greenlighted as a directtovideo project  disneys standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film  
as someone who doesnt believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing  granted  they usually are a bad thing  but thats because theyre made for the wrong reasons   i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking  
fortunately  disney claimed to have been so knockedout by early animation tests that they let pixar go fullspeed ahead with a theatrical sequel  
lucky thing  too  like the first movie  this one is a joy to behold on the big screen  and technically  it improves on its predecessor on just about every level  
  from a business standpoint  the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar  while the previous films elements are shared between pixar and disney  a sign of the production houses new cachet in hollywood   
visually  the main shortcoming of this fully computergenerated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly  making them look a little creepy  
fortunately  that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie  where the secret world of toys is more immediate  and arguably more attractive  than the world of the humans who surround them  
as before  the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy  and  indeed  all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children  come to life in the childs absence  
while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves  the real joy of a toys life is to mean something to its owner  
one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned  left on a shelf to gather dust  and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors  
most often  those toys are packed away in dark spaces  safe from sunlight and humidity  and often theyre not even removed from their packaging  
imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder  and youll understand the attitudes of the collectors items that show up in this movie  
sheriff woody  voiced by a noteperfect tom hanks   the longtime favorite among andys toys who was challenged in the previous goround by the arrival of flashynewthing action figure buzz lightyear  tim allen   suffers an injury early in the film  when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart  revealing the stuffing inside  
this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys  who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy  and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence  
those anxieties are crystallized when andys mom tears through his living room  collecting old toys for a yard sale  
and theres an ironic twist to the tale  as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum  
the rest of andys toys  who owe him quite a debt  resolve to rescue him  
that this film manages to turn a box marked   cents  into a symbol of doom  or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma  is a testament to its skill at metaphor  seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys  
operating on this level of abstraction  toy story  tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness  
  the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan  who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark   
sometimes i think toy story  tries too hard  
theres somewhat less of the seatofthepants loopiness that energized the first film  allowing it to surprise and excite on a nearconstant basis  and more philosophizing about toys  collectors  the nature of happiness and the meaning of life  
while that leads to fewer bellylaughs  it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion  
  just dont ask why andys favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in    
where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at als toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers  buzz lightyear action figures  
forget the selfcongratulatory science fiction of the matrix  this is a fundamental mindbender for buzz  and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight  
here  as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish childrens tv show that originated his character  we see our protagonists come facetoface with god  
in sly ways  then  toy story  can be read as a film about mortality  a metaphorical consideration of aging and death  
significantly  the films very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our openingnight crowd in a nearuproar  
and toward the end  when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys  one of them observes  with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking  that it will be fun while it lasts  
so toy story  joins the tradition of childrens stories  largely neglected of late  that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence  
whats really striking is that both toy story films  and  to a lesser degree  pixars a bugs life  are kids movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts  not to mention whatever piece of totfriendly eyecandy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer  
it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros  animation  
im not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention  they love traditional narrative too much  but  boy  it makes me wonder what they might come up with next
