hollywood has a   
batting average with elmore leonard adaptations  
last years touch was illconceived and just plain odd but get shorty  jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies  
steven soderburgh  master of sex  lies and videotape  now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery  prison  doublecrossing  uncut diamonds and  oh yeah  true love  
george clooney is the protagonist  a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker  but for once i didnt want to slap the taste out of his mouth  
he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary granttype perfected in hitchcock movies  the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other  
nowhere present is clooneys usual aintisexy sneer  theres just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style  
clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty  
clooney plays a man whos robbed about  banks without ever using a gun  
in the opening scene  he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm  
of course  he gets caught  so its not all good  
its while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmates  albert brooks in a frightful bald wig  collection of diamonds in detroit  
clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score  while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans  
meanwhile  theres jennifer lopez  
unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda  shes finally graduated to a worthy role as the u  s  marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes  
rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car  and lopez makes it a threesome  her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney  
hes covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck  and its a little cramped in there  but they manage to make a love connection anyway  probably because its a movie  
the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie  and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noirish crime story  
the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime  and this is no exception  
although theyre not really germane to the plot  lopezs relationship with her father  dennis farina of get shorty   rhames relationship with his christian sister  you could call her sister christian  and a popin cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it  
out of sight spans at least three years but has a nonlinear structure  focusing on the jailbreak  brooks score and flashing back to earlier times  
this is a movie with a brain  as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves  
the entire cast does the material justice  clooney and lopez coming into their own  and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites  
heres hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch  
serving america for almost th of a century
