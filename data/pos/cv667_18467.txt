the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes  and the greedy trade federation has used its armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo  
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboos ruler  the young queen amidala  natalie portman  to sign a treaty giving the federation control  
however  the galactic republic has sent jedi knights quigon jinn  liam neeson  and obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade  
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi  and the first battle begins  
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me  the love for george lucass trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time  
were the fans  not the freaks  
we wont go dressing up like darth vader  although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool   and we wont incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations  not all the time  anyway   but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest  were throwing down  
all right  stop looking at me like that  
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting  
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  
you see  the trilogy is not just a set of movies  but a religion of sorts to we  the faithful disciples  and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  
unfortunately  it is not our savior  
for weeks beforehand  i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good  stupendously good  miraculously good  
anything less and itll be the biggest disappointment of the century  
i didnt want the doomsaying prophecy to come true  really i didnt  but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  
character development is virtually nonexistent  
with the possible exception of quigon  most of the films characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  
none seem very affected by their experiences  and few even show any passion at all  
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks  a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo  in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  
jar jars life is saved by quigon early in the film  and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh  or supposedly so   
his speech mannerisms are so  cuteified  that i couldnt understand a third of what he was saying  and the slapstick he performed was just distracting  
his head gets caught in an electronic field  his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast  he describes being in trouble as  deep doo doo   and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport  
therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors  
in star wars  we had obiwan telling us mos eisley was a  wretched hive of scum and villainy   
in the phantom menace  we get doo doo  
the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story  a long time ago in a galaxy far  far away      
this film  on the other hand  constantly reminds me that its only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience  
perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition  its kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses   and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy like play by play  
i liked the pod race  it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension  but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters  
the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction  
this aspect  coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me  
i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer  but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all  
didnt millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in  over and over again  
didnt the action figures still sell like hotcakes  
of course they did  and its only poor judgment that allows the mosteagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults  
one aspect that will appeal broadly  however  is the use of special effects  
the people at lucass industrial light and magic  the worlds premiere effects house  outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computergenerated images and reallife footage  
some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed  especially the shots of a land battle between the federations robot army and jar jars countrymen  
the space battles are also impressive  although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer  
this  however  is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today  
john williams is back  of course  providing a score for the film as only he can  
his music is pervasive throughout  as rousing and as dramatic as ever  always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately  
since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nineepisode story  star wars  the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four  five and six  respectively   the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already  in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar  
as a result  attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin  
it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obiwan  for example  but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover  it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films  
one of the new characters is darth maul  hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this films release  
in spite of the hype  darth maul is a character which almost didnt have to be in the film  his role is so insignificant  
he has maybe three spoken lines  believe it or not  a second actor voices the character  and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean  
with that working against him  he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment  
lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe  something which has been prominent throughout  
however  he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible  offering an easy out for storywriting and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a reallife connection  
oddly  while trying to capitalize on spirituality  lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little forceloving parasites in your bodys cells  
this only serves to demystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection  
dont let me mislead you too far  
the phantom menace  by most standards  is a good film  
it contains a lot of visual treats  sets the stage for an epic story  gives us a bit of excitement here and there  and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends  
its just that when held up to its predecessors  and to not do so would be unrealistic   this film simply pales
