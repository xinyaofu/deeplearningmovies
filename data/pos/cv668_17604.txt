in december of   a little movie called  scream   was released  became a boxoffice smash  and resurrected films targeted at teens  
first  it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad  both  scream  movies   i know what you did last summer    urban legend   etc    but just recently  the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre  a la s john hughes   starting with last junes  cant hardly wait   
it may be the first week of april in   but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the andunder market almost every single week   varsity blues    jawbreaker    cruel intentions    simply irresistible    the rage  carrie    and  the mod squad   
coming april  are two more of this type   never been kissed  and  go   and on april   weve got the teen satire  election  and the teen horrorcomedy  idle hands   
jeesh  
out of all of these moves  however  the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation    things i hate about you   is this past januarys mediocre  hohum  shes all that   
although similar in plotting  ok  darn near identical     things i hate about you   a modernday version of shakespeares  the taming of the shrew    shes all that  got its inspiration from  pygmalion    is an infinitely superior film in every department  from the smart direction by firsttime feature director gil junger to the charming and wellwritten screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast  who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since s  the breakfast club   
and to top it all off  in the inevitable climax set at the prom  at least we didnt have to once again suffer through a goofy  inappropriate dance sequence  who could forget  or want to remember  for that matter  this ludicrous development in  shes all that     
the day wideeyed  shy new student cameron james  joseph gordonlevitt  starts school at seattlebased padua high  he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore  bianca stratford  larisa oleynik   
although he doesnt know french  he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her  but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father  larry miller  wont allow her to date until her bitter  unconventional older sister  kat  julia stiles   a senior  decides to  
kat  of course  has sworn off the likes of boys  but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her  which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona  heath ledger   
complicating matters  camerons dorky friend  michael  david krumholtz   decides to use a wealthy jock  joey  andrew keegan   who also has his sights set on bianca  as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him  and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey  
as you can see    things i hate about you  includes a huge number of characters  some of which i havent even mentioned  such as kats shakespeareobsessed friend  mandella  susan may pratt  and biancas materialistic comrade  chastity  gabrielle union   
at a short  but wellused running time of  minutes  all of the characters are perfectly handled  satisfyingly developed  and  for the most part  are not treated as caricatures  another flaw of  shes all that   where the bad guys  and gals  ran around constantly saying   youre vapor    
since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters  and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective  i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained  
aside from a good screenplay  its the performances that can make or break a movie  and director junger has really hit the jackpot  
aside from joseph gordonlevitt   rd rock from the sun    who gives his strongest performance to date here  none of the actors are that wellknown  but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings  
as the main character of kat  julia stiles  last seen in the miniseries  the s   is marvelous and always believable  and certainly has a bright future ahead of her  
even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hardedged  it was easy to identify with kats way of thinking  she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath   and i completely admired her individuality  
no one  i think  could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does  
heath ledger  as the infamous badboy of the town  injects much life into patrick  and has a lot of chemistry with stiles  
one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who  with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith  is able to turn bianca into a person with multidimensions  even though she is accurately selfcentered at the onset  
in one truthful scene  cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish  and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes  she has  
one offbeat element of the film  and a source of some hearty laughs  is the way that the schools staff act  which is strikingly unformal  
allison janney  as the guidance counselor ms  perky  who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel  is comic dynamite  as is daryl  chill  mitchell as the english teacher  who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and  at one point  sends kat to the office because  for once  she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good  
although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning  most of it actually works  especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters  
in one very funny scene  chastity asks   i know people can be overwhelmed  and they can be underwhelmed  but can people just be    whelmed   
at another point  bianca and kats father  a standout larry miller   who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant  only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion  before she leaves  she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what its like to be pregnant  
   things i hate about you  once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre  and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the s  
it also helps that the movie has a perfectlyassembled soundtrack  mixing indierock with new wave s songs  and with  thank goodness  no rap   
by the films end  it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together  and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up  especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca  kat and her father  and a flawlesslyacted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class  this is where the title comes from   
luckily  i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about   things i hate about you   but the positive aspects of the film far outnumber ten
