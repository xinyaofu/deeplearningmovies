in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see  
i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike  
but in the case of american beauty  i must make an exception  
if you havent yet seen it  go see it  
now  
stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex  then after youve seen it  come back  
ill wait here  
welcome back  
if you followed my advice  and i see no reason why you should not have  do you    
im sure youve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life  
american beauty is an extraordinary film  a powerful  jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream  
its humorous but it isnt funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production  
mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended  and by god  it works  making it one of the years very best  
lester burnham  kevin spacey  has entered the mother of all midlife crises  
he is living life without a purpose  
he is bored  depressed and sick of his sheltered  insignificant existence  
he barely ever talks to his family  has no sex life  is stuck at a deadend job and thinks he has no reason to live  
but one day  when he and his equally troubled wife  annette bening  attend one of his daughters  thora birch  cheerleading performances  he sees something that makes him come alive  
what he sees is the performance by his daughters friend  the head cheerleader  
he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl  an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature  
but for the first time  lester feels that he is actually living  
this crush is only the beginning  
lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life  buying the car of his dreams  cursing off the boss and quitting his job   today i quit my job  told the boss to f    himself and blackmailed him for     would you pass the asparagus please     
buying drugs from the voyeurnextdoor  ricky fitts  a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be  beauty   and refusing to be docile in family affairs  
his new attitude further alienates his daughter  only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be  and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor  
and the burnhamss neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum  
ricky fitts  wes bentley  serves as the films thematic center  providing the obscure  powerful meaning of the title  
colonel fitts  the father  is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie  even considering his limited screentime  
kevin spacey has never been better  and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel  
he never plays his droll character as a freak  rather  he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic selfexploration by his dissatisfaction with life  
spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime  
equally astonishing is young thora birch  who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness  
at two hours and ten minutes  american beauty didnt feel nearly long enough  
its a complicated  unforgettable film that  like the ice storm two years ago  dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life  
powerfully and cynically  it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream  
it claims that this pictureperfect image is just that  an image  and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it  
the dark  deeply ironic ending  though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie  stays with you for weeks after its all over  
american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released  even more so considering its a masterpiece
