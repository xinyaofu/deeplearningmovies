it is an understood passion and an understood calm  
bud white walks into the home of lynn bracken  a prostitute  cut to look like veronica lake   
hes one of l  a  s finest investigating the murder of fellow cop  and one of the leads takes him to her home  
its understood that he is quiet thunder  a guy whos calm voice is more powerful than his arms  
its understood that shes supposed to be beautiful  but underneath her face is pain and scraped out lines that say her life could have been so much more  
you know without having to be told  
  youre the first guy who hasnt told me i look like veronicca lake in under a minute   she says  
  you look ten times better   
he says it without thinking  
like he knows without her having to say anything  
whites face doesnt turn  it doesnt blush  
you see his eyes  and you believe him  
its a perfect moment in a near perfect movie  
l  a  confidential is the best movie of the year  
it is grace and poetry  a richly layered work of pure entertainment  
it is a portrait of police and morality as it works its way through characters that are so real on screen that you believe that they might have a soul  
in a phrase  it is everything  
it is funny  it is exciting  has enough action and adventure and mystery and grace and suspense  
it is the pinnacle of a movie  a complete work  a flawless film  
its hard to tell you about the plot  because its about so much more than plot  
besides  theres too much to describe  
sure  its about police and searching for corruption and who fights for the right reasons and the definition of justice  
but its also about what you feel when you look into the eyes of the characters in the film  
director curtis hanson has perfectly framed each character  letting you see into them  rooting for them one moment  doubting them the next  
the actors work with their lines  but in this movie their most important weapon is their eyes  
you can tell what each person is feeling just by looking into their eyes for one moment  
russell crowe plays bud white  a muscle cop with a beef for wife beaters  
his movements are fierce  
when he strikes  you jump  when hes calm  you know it wont be for long  
his intensity oozes out of the screen  
you follow his character through the movie afraid of him  but in sympathy of him  because you know how good his heart is  
hes looking for a way to solve crimes  youre just never sure how hes going to do it  
his counter is ed exley  played with a chisselled face by guy pierce  
you feel for him  for his character  because of all the cops in the movie hes the one thats actually trying to do the right thing by going by the book  
you know that he must face the reality of breaking the book  and you love the way he gets there  
ive seen l  a confidential twice  immediately after it was over  i wanted to hit the rewind button and watch it again  
i didnt want the theater experience to end  
its been a long time since i actually experienced a movie  feeling like i got something after i walked out  
thats why i love movies  the great ones can be too rich and powerful to describe  
watch l  a  confidential  after you leave the theater  you feel like you just watched a classic movie  
thats why la confidential stands as the best movie of the year  
l  a  confidential  directed by curtis hanson  
starring russell crowe  guy pierce  kevin spacey  james cromwell  and kim basinger
