for the first reel of girls town  you just cant get over lili taylor  
is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student  
harder still  can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part  
with the sure  showy expertise of a de niro  taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuckyou confidence she can muster  
its a deeply felt  deadon performance  and by the halfway point youve forgiven taylor her own maturity  
for all its verite pretenses  girls town is less about a bunch of highschoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writerperformers examining their own feelings about rape  relationships  and american womanhood  
the movies opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smartsassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation  patti  angela  bruklin harris   emma  anna grace   and nikki  aunjanue ellis   
but about  minutes into the film  we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life  
the remaining girls manage to smug nikkis diary out of her grieving mothers home  and page through it at pattis place  investigating the root of nikkis despair  
what they find is cruel and galvanizing  nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned  and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen  
shellshocked by the truth of the matter  the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives  
emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player  
pattis barely sympathetic  wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jocks car  
and anyway  pattis had her own share of guys who wouldnt take no for an answer  
pained  acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry  angry about the impossibility of saying no  and angry with themselves for being weak  for being naive  for putting up with it  
  why do we put up with it   
emma finally asks  once the argument has reached a fever pitch  
  we try to talk about it  and look what happens  
we fight for  minutes   
theres the admirable crux of this picture  
girls town is a political film  in that it calls for action  
but its incompleteits never quite sure how to justify that action  or what form it should take  
the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity  and its surely one of this years most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passengerside window of that damn jocks car  doing the right thing    
they hang out in the bathroom  chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall  
  subvert the patriarchy   emma writes  and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to  
the girls silence their hecklers  take revenge on the deadbeat father of pattis child  and eventually come facetoface with nikkis tormentor  
still  the movie has a desperately unfinished quality  and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying  
  you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls  but nobody thinks of it   
perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand  the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah   who you callin a bitch     
the points are well taken  but they should have been unnecessary  
long on characterization but a little short on story  girls town is less than it could have been  and too selfcongratulatory for my own taste  
director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r  e  m  s 
michael stipe  he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band   and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking  
the movie was created and scripted by committee  but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when  predictably  the group couldnt secure funding  
then again  girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film  
the movies slapdash quality is key to its significance  
truth be told  all three of the leads look too wise for high school  but thats ok  theres a onceremoved quality to their fine  spontaneous performances  as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were  the girls they wish they had been  or some combination  
for all its flaws  this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place
