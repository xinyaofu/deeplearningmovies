it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of  the horse whisperer   the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to  projection difficulties   
robert redfords film version of nicholas evans bestselling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december  going headtohead with  titanic   but is only now making its much anticipated debut  
this  strategic   
delay has allowed  the horse whisperer  to compete  sans fanfare  against some smaller  unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office  
no matter  
redfords film stands head and shoulders above james camerons oceangoing tragedy  especially in the writing and acting departments  
whatever the reasons for its postponement   the horse whisperer  supports the old adage  better late than never   
redford has taken evans book and given it the big screen treatment  
while parts of  the horse whisperer  are epic in scope and vision  especially the aerial  travelogue  that maps out this great country of ours  its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast  
when her daughter  grace  is involved in a terrible riding accident  harddriven fashion editor annie maclean  kristin scott thomas  devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and graces beloved horse  pilgrim  
refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down  annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faithhealing cowboy of sorts called tom booker  redford   who has a way with horses and  perhaps  with people too  
undeterred by toms initial reluctance to get involved  annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him  and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal  
redfords film unfolds slowly and lovingly  echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds  
the films a little long and  even if you havent read the book  its pretty obvious where its headingbut these are minor complaints  
redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other  but its scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role  
dianne wiest  chris cooper   lone star    and sam neillbetter than ive seen him beforeround out the respectable supporting cast  
and the directors respect for horses is clearly in evidence  
one word of warning  however  while brilliantly shot  the accident scene  involving an outofcontrol truck  is extremely disturbing  
redfords canvas is huge and exquisite  
he doesnt hesitate to incorporate vast  sprawling vistas of the american northwest  spectacular  snowcapped mountain ranges  azure skies  and shimmering fields of wheatall are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardsons viewfinder  
veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity  since  the horse whisperer  is  dances with wolves  by way of  out of africa   oscar winners both for barry   
fortunately  barrys replacement  thomas newman  contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate  human conditionssonorous  stringladen passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic  introspective movements ripe with nuance  
  the horse whisperer  is that rare kind of movie  it looks good  it feels good  and by golly it does you good  
the wait  it turns out  was well worth it
