alchemy is steeped in shades of blue  
kieslowskis blue  that is  
with its examination of death  isolation  character restoration  and recovery from loss  suzanne myers new independent film echoes the polish directors internationallyacclaimed  release  
language aside  the principal difference between the films is that  while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main characters world  alchemy keeps its viewers at arms length  
as a result  while were able to appreciate the films intellectual tapestry  it is emotionally distant  
alchemy is divided into three chapters   charity    faith   and  hope   
while there are common themes and story elements running through all three  the single constant is the main character  a sculptorrussian translator named louisa  rya kihlstedt   
when the film opens  shes living with her painter boyfriend  whom she believes to be cheating on her  
following his sudden death in an automobile accident  louisas life is thrown into turmoil  
events swirls around her  and she cant find a source of stability  
in her quest to make sense out of her loss  she befriends her late boyfriends mistress  visits her ill sister  and  eventually  abandons her old life by joining a  backto nature  cult  
alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues  
in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one  it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process  the meaning of love  and the nature of art  
does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar  
are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life  with all of its various distractions  to the fullest  
myers challenge is to make these subjects  art film staples  engrossing in a new context  
through louisas struggles  she succeeds  
while alchemy isnt always emotionally appealing  it never loses its fascination  
even when were not connecting with louisa  who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fullydeveloped personality  theres enough material onscreen to hold our attention  
the cinematography is stunning  
city scenes are tinted with blue  adding a cold  bleak dimension to the films early portions  
later  when louisa reaches the  wilderness   were treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor  brightlycolored leaves in the trees and on the ground  
its a startlingbuteffective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisas life as she travels the road back to emotional stability  
the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith healers who use  alchemy  to provide for the needs of the body and soul  
and  although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine  its ultimately love and companionship  not alchemy  that brings solace  
her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is lifes ultimate goal  
even though louisas final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character  its still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch  
alchemy isnt pure magic  but  especially during its best moments  its close
