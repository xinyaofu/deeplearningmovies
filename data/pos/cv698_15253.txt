a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nationstate against another  
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy  the violence continues  
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone  even total innocents   anywhere  at anytime that gives the figure his label  
edward zwicks the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  
youd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad  and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  
however  unlike the reallife tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin ladens camp and manufacturing facility  the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  
in retaliation  the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  
unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agentincharge anthony hubbard  denzel washington   who works out of the bureaus new york office at one federal plaza  
while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple  he encounters cia agent elise kraft  annette bening   also trying to uncover information  
generally  the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s   while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  
hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory  but as the two form a tentative professional relationship  hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government  
the original tagline for patriot games was   there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil   
however true  it was pulled before the movies release because it sounded too much like a dare  
revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states  the siege is almost an invitation in itself  because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america  
admittedly  the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive  whos going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by twothirds    but the basic premise is still valid  
i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic actionthriller fare of good guy gmen against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order  
it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arabamerican population  and that in an effort to find the terrorists  the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself  
in fact  about halfway through the film  when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city  the liberties of all americans are put at risk  
although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign  the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups  
throughout  the film maintains a conflict between hubbard  who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law  and general devereaux  bruce willis   who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully  
what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act  utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides  
it actually gets rather heady at times  but its a credit to screenwriters zwick  lawrence wright  and menno meyjes that they dont underestimate the intelligence of the audience  
i dont know if its his tone or inflection or something else  but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great  
this  combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the midlevel authority figure  makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable  
annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character ive seen recently  and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable  
its somewhat unfortunate that her characters fortitude is broken at a certain point  but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range  
bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a toughguy role  always standing straight  and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face  
however  the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the films development  
notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad  a lebanese immigrant  
the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage  and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society  
difficult to say the least  shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch  
perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom  wings   shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night  
whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwicks favorite actor  he directed washington in glory and courage under fire   james horner seems to be his favorite composer  
i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific scorewriter graeme revell  seven films this year already  over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabianthemed music  and horners record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irishsounding at most  
revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole  
its nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films weve been getting throughout the year  
missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes  
for example  its pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick  
unfortunately  theres a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions  obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eyecatching  
in the middle of the city  and against no real opposition   zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than  feet from friendly troops  
verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point  
the film also gets a little preachy toward the end  focusing on the ability of different races to get along  
a noble gesture  the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously  
these flaws are glaring  but they dont detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class
