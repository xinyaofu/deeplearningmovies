the characters in  palmetto  collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie  and its just the right way to capture the films ripe atmosphere of sensuality  tension and even farce  
this humid floridaset thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself  which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke  
as far as setup is concerned  the movie is nothing we havent seen before  but be patient   palmetto  spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really dont see coming  
its not a classic by any means  but it sure is quite an engaging surprise  
harry barber  woody harrelson  is fresh out of prison  where hes served a couple of years for a crime he didnt commit  
even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials  harrys first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina  gina gershon   
while searching for work  he catches the eye of rhea malroux  elisabeth shue   the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire  
rhea proposes a scheme thatll get harry    easy  to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette  chloe sevigny   
  you do like risks  dont you  mr  barber   
rhea alluringly coos  
boys  form a line behind me  
part of  palmetto  s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue  who demonstrates here that her oscarnominated turn in  leaving las vegas  might merely be foreshadowing great things to come  
shues a seductive  campy delight  and pulls off a barbara stanwyckgloria swanson combo with admirable relish  
the other actors form a solid ensemble around her  including sevigny   kids    tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease  as well as the everlikeable gershon  cast a far cry from her extreme roles in  bound  and  showgirls   
harrelson is still doing fine followup work to  the people vs  larry flynt   
  palmetto  does have its share of grievances  
harrelsons narration is needless  i suppose  and gershons nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is  
one of the plots unexpected angles  that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which hes involved  could have been played a little better  
there are moments when you question the tone  but its never so unstable that it deserves the reproach its been receiving from most other critics  
if  palmetto  didnt want to be laughed at  would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a liveaction  who framed roger rabbit   
although a few elements can be questioned  the movie works well on its own terms  
thanks to a juicy cast  especially shue  and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff  you remember him from last summers suddenly repopular  the tin drum   right    
everything runs smoothly  
and for fans of revelationheavy endings  this films got a few shocks in store that i wont even dream of revealing  
  palmetto  is a generous amount of fun to watch  and thats all you need to know
