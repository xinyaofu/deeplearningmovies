the reunion film is not an original idea in any way  shape  or form  
its been done throughout film history over and over again  and has become one of the many subgenres  like the prep school subgenre  the angstfilled teen subgenre  and the slasher subgenre  
what makes  peters friends  so remarkable is not how it doesnt follow the rules of this subgenre  but how it follows it so well  and creates characters that i wouldnt mind hanging with  
what are the rules of the reunion subgenre  
well     
  you need a group of friends  most of them married or at least dating  and sometimes even married or dating eachother  
  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  
  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  
  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by   
  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic  
  the reunion has to bring them together  seperate them with little crises  then bring them back together because  after all  theyre friends  
  there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited  
  eightly  theyre all unhappy or marginally so  
  theres some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them thats built up over the years  
  the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts  sometimes internationally so  
  the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends  sometimes causing them to get together in dancesong  
since it follows these rules so closely  it will probably be  and has been  coined off as just a  british big chill    
and in some ways it is  
both follow the rules  as i said  and both feature lots of bitching  big confessionals  and broken relationships  
but while  the big chill  was  at least to me  a tad too whiny and unsatisfying   peters friends  hits its mark  making this film funny  dramatic  and poignant  
the friends of peters were all in the same theatre group back in   performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them  the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus   
after peters  stephen fry  wealthy father  richard briers  hardly on screen enough to register  but oh well  dies  leaving a giant mansion to him  he has to decide whether or not to keep it  
not sure what to do with it immeadiately  he decides to throw a giant reunion party  inviting back all his old chums  
of course  all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule  
andrew  kenneth branagh  also directing here  is an actor whos unhappily married to a tv star  carol  cowriter rita rudner   
maggie  emma thompson  is a successfuly publisher of selfhelp books  but looks like she needs them more than her customers  as she is lonely and unhappy  
roger and mary  hugh laurie and imelda staunton  who were also married in  sense and sensibility   are married  and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk  but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died  
and sarah  alphonsia emmanuel  is as promiscuous as ever  having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian  tony slattery  whos married and wants a divorce because of her  giving her doubts  
as for peter  things seem okay    
the film features lots of innerfriend jokes  and even some old theatre anecdotes  which i at least find a lot of fun in  as ive done lots of theatre myself   
and there are big confessions  brawls between the friends  and by the end  almost everyone is unhappy  even though some have resolved their problems long before the end  which i kinda dug   
the final twist would seem forced an anticlimactic  but for some reason  i felt the same way the rest of the friends did  
maybe its because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique  
thats really what makes  peters friends  so lovable  the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes  but when someones in crisis  can come together wonderfully for one another  
its when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends  and these people are true friends  
not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the s  a decade i grew up in  unfortunately  without taking us outside of the s  
there are some s classics and anticlassics like tears for fears  everybody wants to rule the world   but unfortunately no stupidfun s songs  i think if i ever did an s reunion film  id put some crap go gos song on  or at least some good old  come on eileen    but this is the british s were talking about  
oh well  
but anyway  the direction is pretty good  although nothing amazing  
branaghs forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical  but at least hes very good with making a less ambiguous film like this  
the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman  with lots of good oneliners  and even some really bad but good puns  to mock the fact that andrew lives in l  a   peter  while cutting some logs  asks him is he has wood in l  a   and andrew says   no  but we have hollywood   punishment like that   
the actors  as in most speaking movies  are better than their material  though  with some standout performances to the six friends  as well as the outsiders like slattery  rudner  and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peters mansion  
a little note should be made about hugh lauries performance  as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this  i mean  ive never seen him actually act this dramatically  
  peters friends  is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion  although i dont know what kind ill have  like most people  i dont look forward to my high school reunion   
because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation  i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that
