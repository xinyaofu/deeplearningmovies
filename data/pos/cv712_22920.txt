when i first heard about scream in   i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies  
from the master of the horror himself  wes craven  it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them  by making the teenagers do what they know theyre not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them  dont run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door  never say  ill be right back   etc    
when i first heard this description  i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie  
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  
was this wes cravens remedy from making  real  bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn  
it just seemed cheap to me  
then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes  involving drew barrymore and a nailbitingly intense phone conversation  completely changed my attitude  
scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick  its also a pretty scary movie  
if youve seen a million of these kinds of films  you know exactly what is going to happen  
this is part of the fun of watching scream  
the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent  attractive teenagers  
to those who rarely see these types of movies  scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film  
theres nothing wrong with that misjudgment though  
i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience  the newbies to horror and the fanatics  
their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive  
from these varied reviews  i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories  
films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed  in my opinion  if it was not for the outstanding success of scream  
the low  budget  gem may  alongside pulp fiction  be the most influential film of the s  
this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs  tingle or television programs such as dawsons creek but to others such as myself  we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors  screenwriters  and directors  
scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quicklypaced script by kevin williamson  
within the film are characters who tell other characters  as well as the audience  the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie  
mainly from the rants of randy  jamie kennedy  and stu  matthew lillard   we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well  the virgin always survives  have sex and youre dead meat   
not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors  
the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own selfsatisfaction  
in this case  williamson finds these errors for the audiences satisfaction and amusement  
i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream  which is a spoof of scary movies  
i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than screams perfect subtlety  
however my last gut feeling about this stuff  scream  was dead wrong    
so who knows
