its not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts  
but thats just what happened to me at uhf  weird al yankovics big screen debut  
uhf is a television parody a la airplane  and like airplane  the movie is extraordinarily stupid  
but its dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb  its so silly and outrageous its hilarious  
the movie stars weird al as george newman  a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination  the type who fantasizes hes indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns  
george is basically a loser  his daydreams and smartalec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks  
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel  in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station  
george revives channel  with innovative programming  shows like  wheel of fish  and movies like  conan  the librarian   
as the stations ratings rise  it comes into competition with channel   the leading vhf networkaffiliate  
as r  j  
fletcherchannel s illnatured  hardnosed ownerveteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy  he really hams it up with his snorts  grimaces  and scowls  
uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television  including game shows  tabloid talk shows  childrens shows  dizzy news women  and movieseverything from rambo to close encounters  
the funniest scene  the one that made my head spin  is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed  
like most movies in its genre  uhf is hit or miss  
for every gag that works  at least one fizzles  
for instance  weird als mock video of  money for nothing  by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt  although it does have some nifty computer animation   
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail  we know another gut wrencher is on the way  
in fact  uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplanetype movie since    
well  since airplane  
much of the credit goes to weird als exceptionally inventive script and to the movies winsome cast  
weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning  but because hes not afraid to look silly  he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character  
the real standout is michael richards as stanley  the dimwitted janitor who becomes the host of his own childrens show   stanley spadowskis playhouse   
stanleys offbeat  mixedup personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an overnight star  
he is an endearing mixture of goodnatured innocence  highenergy enthusiasm  and puppydog cuteness  
and above all  hes a good janitor who adores his work  
another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips  
the cast also features gedde watanabe  the chinese foreignexchange student in sixteen candles  as the karate master who hosts the hit series   wheel of fish   
also aboard for the ride is fran drescher  who plays pamela finklestein  channel s roving reporter  
unfortunately  as weird als girlfriend  victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering  whining  and sulking  
her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether  
while uhf is not an absolute mustsee  its definitely the ticket if youre looking for a wild and zany  whackedout comedy  
the movie is good enough to see in the theaters  but it may work even better on television  the very medium at which it pokes fun
