after indecent proposal and up close and personal  redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last  
redford may look great onscreen  but over the past few years  hes proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera  
ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteeneighties  and it was the first picture he helmed  
while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magicrealism with    um  
realism  and ive never been much of a fan of a river runs through it  to the chagrin of many   quiz show was dazzling  energetic and convincing  
the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that subgenre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery  
scottthomas plays annie maclean  an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace  johanssen  loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi  
graces horse survived  but barely  and has gone mad  
annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery  believing that if the horse heals it will mend graces newlybroken spirit  
eventually  mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker  redford   a famed  horse whisperer  who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches  leaving busy husband neill behind  
eventually  they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of toms family  and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana  including  naturally  tom  the wise and lonely trainer  
the horse whisperer is delicately made  
i dare say lyrical  since to many peoples ear  that word is synonymous with boring  
hardly  
the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise  but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch  especially in the final third of the story  
scottthomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter  and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell  especially since d  p  
robert richardsons photography casts montana as heaven on earth  
  a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana   
the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt  emotive performance as the niceguy husband  who is as authoritive and likeable as tom  
he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist  lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a shortcut for explaining away the cheating spouses motivation  
unfortunately  one of the horse whisperers only flaws is the chemistry between wouldbe lovers scottthomas and redford  
i liked both of them  but i didnt necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish  even if the countryside air thawed her slightly  
luckily  and curiously   this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesnt quite mattertheir adultery seems like an afterthought  the obligatory subplot that ties many of the characters complex relationships together
