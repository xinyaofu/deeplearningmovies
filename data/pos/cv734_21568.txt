i remember making a pact  right after patch adams  to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality  
but darn it  music of the heart is just layered with feelgood material and bright characterizations  
its hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with its manipulation  
in addition  its also a terrific family film  
this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari  who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools  
it could also be described as mrs  
streeps opus  
yes  meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari  and that brings both good news and bad  
out of the gate  possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing  it is relatively difficult to identify with robertas character and grasp her academic pointofview  
she is very strict with her students  but what insight does that create into the story  
slowly but surely  we begin to recognize the intentions of the character  and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied  
one thoroughly interesting fact about music of the heart lies with the unlikely presence in the directors chair  horror veteran wes craven  
after leaving an impression with the scream films and the original nightmare on elm street  craven has attempted a precarious crossover to drama  
at first  his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious  but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material  
it doesnt carry the heartwarming courage of mr  
hollands opus  but music of the heart is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth  
the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate  
yes  oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep  but its the solid ensemble cast that makes music of the heart work  
angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams  the principal at an inner city school who initially doesnt hire roberta because of her lack of experience  
blueeyed adian quinn is endearing  as always  playing a new love interest  
gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive secondgrade teacher  and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force  
its like a schoolteachers version of thelma and louise  in a restrained but effective manner  
the movie tackles more issues than just guasparis teaching of violin  
theres some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons  who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman  
in its dramatic buildup  the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth  
its a good movie for anyone to see  although missing out on the experience would not be a lifealtering decision  
its commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult crossover  and also for achieving his intricate goal  
watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments  who may ask yourself  this is the guy who directed scream  
of course  when the third installment of that series comes around in february   with craven directing   you may find yourself wondering  this is the guy who directed music of the heart  
mission accomplished  wes  
thankfully  there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film  
in its entirety  its a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family  despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile  
the child actors are cute and perform up to par  even if some of their problems are clich  d and predictable in the extreme  
the mother who doesnt want her son to be learning white mans music  the unexpected casuality    
basically everything is there  
it doesnt strike the perfect chord  but music of the heart is highly convincing  
the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better  but music of the heart is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals
