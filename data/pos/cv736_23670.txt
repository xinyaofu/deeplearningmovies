the premise of the new teentargeted horror film final destination causes a recollection of a memorable simpsons halloween episode  
after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster  lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable timemachine  
after a trek into the cretaceous period  homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world  
again and again  homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it  
the characters of final destination have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence  their design  
someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake  
that someone is death  
you see  alex browning  devon sawa  and six others have cheated the grim reaper     
but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve  
for a high school excursion  alexs french class is traveling to paris by airline transport  
alex  tense and neurotic  has a shocking premonition after boarding  he sees the plane  and every passenger on it  spontaneously explode in midair  
in a panic of sheer lunacy  alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft  
after a handful of others  including one teacher  follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane  the unwitting  survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky  
the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize  
but death wont be cheated so easily  and one by one  the survivors of flight  are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances  
the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi  
before i delve into the meat of the review  id just like to confer     
is that one helluva premise  or what  
final destination  creepy beyond rational comprehension  probably reads more like an unsettling xfiles episode than the simpsons  therefore  the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong  
on familiar turf  the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong  and the opening  minutes of final destination reflects that  
unlike most thrillers  the setup is crisp and cool  
you just deeply  sincerely hope that the momentum wont unspool  leaving us with a secondstring effort with nothing but cheap  derivative shocks  
young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration  what with i know what you did last summer and sequel  idle hands and  a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil  urban legend  
after the setup  when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair  i started to really have fun with final destination  
low and behold  a teen thriller that is actually unsettling  actually suspenseful and  yes  actually intelligent  
some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside  this film is among the most refreshing and allout enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cuttingedge scream in   
final destination stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the bloodspattered slasher crap weve endured throughout the past few years  
not that the characters are that good  
sawa is game as alex  a connectthedots personality that we never fully comprehend  
in addition  the survivors are endearing geek tod  chad e  donella   jocky controlfreak carter  kerr smith of dawsons creek   carters ditzy girlfriend terry  amanda detmer   the nonetoosubtly named billy hitchcock  seann william scott  supplier of lukewarm comic relief  and a lone teacher  the emotionally delicate ms  lewton  kristin cloke   
aside from alex  the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter  varsity blues   playing an abstract character named clear rivers  what were her parents thinking      
the personality of clear is written with such a vague  nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flashcard saying hello  i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main characters plight   
toss a few stereotypical fbi agents  daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith  and a     ummm    
spiritual mortician  former candyman tony todd  into the mix  and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing  dicing and assorted disembowelments  
not so  
final destination has no slicing and dicing  or at least none dealt by a human killer  and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening  
the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying  murdererontheloose concept  with assistance from a shrewd  intelligently paced screenplay by morgan  wong and jeffrey reddick  
the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity  listen up  reindeer games   
but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination is the murder scenes  
creative  resourceful and breathlessly inventive  the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a characters demise  
what will trigger the accident  
will it be the john denver record  just put on to play rocky mountain high  
  yeah  sick humor   
will it be the leaking toilet  
the falling fishing reel in the corner  
the murders are startling and largely unforeseen  including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward  
a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach  
it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes  but who cares  
its fun  
in that simple regard  final destination is my cup of tea  
this stylishly executed thriller  although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue  is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side  
after the show  it will also have an frightening impact on you  
when will your  design expire  
is death waiting around the corner  
the final effect is a major case of the heebiejeebies
