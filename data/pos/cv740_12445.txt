a couple of months ago  when i first downloaded the faceoff trailer from the net  my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold yawn  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key  not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this pisspoor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     mustsee  
well  i thought still skeptical  i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
here  of course  was still three months away  
ill admit  when i trotted off to see this film  the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
id heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled  but his films were definitely not on my mustsee list  
that  let me tell you  has changed completely  
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film  after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick  
seriously  
ive never been a big john travolta fan  but he  like cage  perfectly suited his role in the movie      sorry  
make that roles in the movie  
even travoltas great performance  however  paled in comparison to cages character portrayals  
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hasslers hideout  
half drugged out of his mind  he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his sons death from castors perspective   doesnt it just break your heart   he mutters coldly  
now dont go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie  its not  
thats what really makes this movie unique  
its an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters      not a common mix at all  
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though      thats 
the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around  rounds at each other     and 
never hit  
several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press rewind and watch it over again  
the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a doublesided mirror is just plain brilliant  
whilst cages and travoltas performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies  the lesser characters are just as intriguing  
joan allen  who usually sticks to the straight drama movies  plays her part perfectly as archers long suffering wife  
i like the fact that her character didnt end up toting a gun at the end of the movie    it 
would have wrecked her potrayal  
gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troys mistreated girlfriend      make that  one of  castor troys mistreated girlfriends  
other movies would have used her character as just window dressing    a 
sex object  but instead her character is very strong and independent  
dominique swain  who plays archers daughter  also does a nice job  though her character is not as explored as much as allens or gershons  
faults  well    there were some i have to say  
first  the movies ending  whilst being very good overall  was a bit too drawn out for its own good  
after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you cant help but think   geez  are you guys nuclear powered or what    
there were certain bits that werent handled properly  like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platformprison  more explanation here would have been nice  
overall  this movie was not perfect  
but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect  
many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made      i 
certainly hope so
