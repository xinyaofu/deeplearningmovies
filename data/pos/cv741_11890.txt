those print and television ads trumpeting that  grease is still the word  are right on the money  
to celebrate its th anniversary  this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like  star wars   a welldeserved  redcarpet rerelease  
thats fantastic  especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up  who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie  didi conn  being serenaded by her tellitlikeitis guardian angel  frankie avalon   
or the hardnosed principal  eve arden  reminding the student body to  be an athletic supporter  by rooting for the home team  
or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine  edd byrnes  flirting with marty  a pre  empty nest  dinah manhoff   
and these are all probably considered minor moments    
a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newtonjohn have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson  and their pairing still ranks as one of screendoms most effervescently charming  
for those eight of you who arent familiar with the story  heres a brief recap  greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their  senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer  both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started  but both were wrong  
sandy tries to rekindle their relationship  but dannys too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his tbird buddies  including jeff conaway   
so sandy hooks up with a gang herself  the pink ladies  headed by sassy  sexy rizzo  stockard channing  just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time   and danny  who still really feels love for her  attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back  
the drag race finale is yet something of a drag  and i never have thought much of  greased lightening   the films big  guy  number  that choreography  ack    but  grease  s flaws amount too few to carp  
the movies first showpiece is  summer nights   where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their funinthesun romance  
not only is  nights  tremendously catchy  but its also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes  
there has yet to be a liveaction musical sequence that rivals the onetwo punch of  youre the one that i want  and  we go together    grease  s euphoric cappers  
all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller  quieter moments  the oscarnominated  hopelessly devoted to you  is a lovely showcase for newtonjohn  and channings lamenting ballad  there are worse things i could do  is one of  grease  s most unjustly overlooked tunes  
the soundtrack is remastered  though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of  nights   and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously panandscannedout choreography  but nothing else has changed  no computergenerated backgrounds  no outtakes or new musical numbers  no jabba the hutt cameos  
and its a testament to  grease  s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed  its the same allaround blast its always been  with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music  
to s viewers   grease  will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doowop and poodle skirts  
but regardless of what decade it transports us to  we can all agree on one thing  without a doubt   grease  is still the word
