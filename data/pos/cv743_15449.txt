once again  the battle is dreamworks versus disney  earlier this year  the mammoth companies fought to the death with their endoftheworld asteroid flicks  deep impact and armageddon  
here we are now  just a few months later  and theyre at it again with dueling bug movies  antz and a bugs life  
what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution  
i mean  come on  what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computeranimated films about bugs  
as was the case with the meteor movies  disney has come out on top  though antz is a likable movie  a bugs life is far superior  
in fact  this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz  i became immersed in the world of a bugs life  while antz just made me scrutinize everything  
but its not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison  
a bugs life is a remarkable film in its own right  and deserves to be seen apart from any other computeranimated film about bugs  
in fact  its one of the best films this year  its smart  subtle  and funny  but its also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining  
i havent had such a good time at the movies in months  
it tells the story of an ant named flick  voice by dave foley   hes a nice guy  but hes also a troublemaker  
the ants spend all season putting together the offering  a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers  
just before the grasshoppers come  flick accidentally knocks over the offering  and ruins everything for the entire colony  the grasshoppers leader  hopper  kevin spacey   is enraged  and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer  or theyre all dead  
flick  feeling responsible for this  sets off to look for help  he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them  
he heads to the city  the city being a house a few miles away   where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs  a ladybug  denis leary  who is spectacular   a black widow  bonnie hunt   a caterpillar  joe ranft   a butterfly  madeline kahn   a rhinoceros beetle  michael mcshane   and a stick  david hydepierce  also giving a hilarious performance   
flick doesnt know theyre actors  and they dont know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers  so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position  
the most obvious element of a bugs life is the quality of animation  
created by pixar  the same people who brought us toy story  a bugs life has some of the most amazing visuals ive ever seen  
the bugs seem to inhabit a threedimensional space  and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action  
this is a lush  colorful world  full of life and imagination  the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives  matches  bottlecaps  tin cans  etc   and make them active objects in the bugs world is innovative  
the film is also mercilessly exciting  particularly in a superblystaged scene involving our heroes escape from a bird  a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening   
but the makers of a bugs life know where the importance lies  story and characters  
flick  with solid voice work from foley  is a great guy to lead the story  
but the real treat comes with the circus bugs  theyre such a likable group of characters  the standouts are the stick  hydepierce is so good   francis the ladybug  and the big fat caterpillar  
all of these bugs have more than a token personality  which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs  and it also keeps the tearjerking scenes from seeming obligatory  
in my review of antz  i said that the film is a clever copout because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an antlike existence  
in concept  a bugs life is basically the same movie  except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didnt like about it  
with such strong work in both animation and script  a bugs life is nothing but a joy to sit through  
it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie  but a bugs life is so good that im sure it will find its audience  
after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies  its downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty
