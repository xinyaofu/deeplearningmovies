  dimension films   scream   s distributor  has asked press to say extremely little  if anything  about the films twisty plot  
thats no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here  but i will do my best to be vague  now  theres a first    
  the first one was good  but all the rest sucked   said a cinematicallysavvy teen in last winters wes craven thriller  scream   her statement referring to the films of the  nightmare on elm street  series but really putting down franchise overkill in general  
the comment certainly carries clout  for every truly great sequel  there appears to be a couple of duds  making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas  
but like it or not  along comes  scream    and believe it or not  its a doozy  a slick  sinister  madly subversive good time at the movies  as intent on sending up hollywoods sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions  
  scream   is definitely that rare movie thing  a followup that can stand along side its original with pride  
its been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munchesque getups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro  california  
those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives  
plucky heroine sidney prescott  neve campbell  is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college  her pop culturewhiz pal randy meeks  jamie kennedy  has tagged along  
trash tabloid reporter gale weathers  courteney cox  has written a bestseller based on their ordeal  the basis of which has been turned into a  very bad  movie called  stab   
and dewey riley  david arquette   still suffering from wounds inflicted during  scream   has left his job as a police officer for a while  
life is tranquil    
at least for a while  
several sudden murders bring sidney  randy  gale and dewey together again  but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings  if these four people learned anything from the past  its to trust no one  
thus  the possible victimpotential killer list includes said quartet  as well as  derek  jerry oconnell   sidneys new beau  cici  sara michelle gellar   a chatty sorority gal  joel  duane martin   gales cameraman whos not too thrilled with her bloodsoaked past  hallie  elise neal   sidneys sassy roommate  debbie  laurie metcalf   a local reporter who gives gale some nottoofriendly competition  and mickey  timothy olyphant   randys good friend and fellow film student  
cotton weary  liev schreiber   the man sidney wrongly accused of her mothers murder in scream  also shows up on campus  but why  
like the first scream  craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang  
this time  its an extended sequence that finds an africanamerican couple  jada pinkett and omar epps  attending a sneak preview of  stab   making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat nonroles of blacks in slasher cinema  
before tragedy ensues at the screening  the moviewithinamovie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments  including a scene from  stab  which turns screams nowfamous drew barrymore prologue on its ear  
   b  hang up the phone and star his a   
pinkett yells at the screen   
its funny  creepy stuff  i dont think ill ever feel safe in a movie theater again  that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road  
another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phoneassault of the killer on randy  dewey and gale in broad daylight  it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters  
there are other superb set pieces  but explaining them risks ruining their effect  
there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count  
its something of a tradein  the new characters are too large in number to be as fullydeveloped as the original  scream  gang  but this movie packs in knowing performances  especially by kennedy and cox  and more death for your dollar  
it can be argued that  while the original might outclass it by a tad  scream  is both scarier and funnier  
it certainly doesnt skimp with shocks  a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart  i actually questioned craven and williamsons judgment here  considering how much this person has added to these films   
sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab  the two scenes were shown are deadon  but for film fans  there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like  the usual suspects    aliens  and  the empire strikes back   
still   scream   does so many things right  its petty to quibble  
its penchant for parody is irresistible  discussions of the merits of film sequels and all  
the attractive  solid cast is a definite bonus  
and the denouement  while not as shocking as  scream  s  is priceless  the films final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in  scream  with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper  
all this and a  scream   is in the works  
knowing the series tendency for selfreference  perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice  
mentioning  scream   ll help them in their argument
