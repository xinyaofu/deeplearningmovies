scream  has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well  
during a filmclass discussion  windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are  and why sequels never live up to the originals  
a few rare exceptions are noted  but they left out one  
  
  
scream   
s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america  
a sequel was unavoidable  but luckily the reteaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment  
in fact  at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream  i would say that scream  might even be the better film  
sidney prescott  neve campbell   the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro  ca in the original scream  is now two years older and off to college  majoring in theater  
meanwhile  tv journalist gale weathers  courtney cox   who covered the murders in the first film  has since written a book about the dreadful events  a book titled  stab   which has been developed into a major motion picture  
as scream  opens  a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of  stab   and before long  a young couple are butchered to death  unnoticed in the midst of hysteria  
this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown  copycat  sets out to repeat whats been done  
  
  
and finish what hasnt  
of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film  and yes  movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as heshe goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds  but this  is  a sequel  and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies  
this is in large part due to williamsons deliciously written script  which will easily leave you satisfied  
as much as the film condemns the use of cliches  it is riddled with them  but it is done so effectively  and with skillful direction by craven  that youre not bound to complain  
i will note  however  that the  whodunit   
did wind up being the first person i suspected  but believe me  i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie  
all the actors outdo themselves here  
were not talking oscar performances  but cambell  cox  david arquette as dewey riley  and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing  
the characters remain true to their roots  and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years  
we can see how the events in the first film has affected them  but we dont lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place  
the nice thing about scream  is that it doesnt seem offkilter from its predecessor  
its a natural  smooth  and believable  as far as horror films go  transition from film to film  
we skip two years  but there doesnt seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks  
it flows so well that you feel more like youre reading chapter two of a book  long chapters  eh   
than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces  
while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels  scream s entire plot structure correlates  completely  with the first  making for immediate fondness and absorption  
as i said before  scream  easily lives up to  if not surpassing  its precursor  
the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream  is because it was the first  
this doesnt mean that it overcasts the unique  whimsical humor or overall caliber of its sequel  it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked its own while maintaining its soughtafter qualities  
if ever a film followed its original so well  it would be scream   and it makes this a definite mustsee for all those unbridled scream fans out there  
scream  fits snugly alongside scream  and will hopefully receive as many high remarks  
it would top off the series quite well  if it werent for the fact that two movies dont really make a series  
its unlikely to assume that a scream  wont appear in the next few years  but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horrortrilogy  lets hope they can keep up the fantastic work  
like they say  dont mess with perfection  
  
  
but when a moneymaking smashhit is almost guaranteed  whos gonna listen
