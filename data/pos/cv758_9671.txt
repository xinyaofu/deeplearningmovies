devotees of robert a  heinlein  be forewarned  paul verhoevens starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinleins novel than it is a literary satire  
the authors jingoalltheway militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless  faceless parade of carnage from the film version  
and i suppose thats exactly what verhoeven delivers  with sometimes hilarious results  
heinleins basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement  while their strengths become the stuff of highenergy entertainment  
outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor  since its basically a big bug hunt    aliens in broad daylight  
sometime in the future  humanity is threatened by giant  malevolent insects which have evolved into twentyfoottall action figures  arachnids with superimpaling spikes  beetles that spew forth lava  dragonflies with guillotine legs   
among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires  conflicted rich kid johnny rico  casper van dien   his math whiz girlfriend carmen  denise richards   dizzy  dina meyer   who secretly carries a torch for johnny  and carl  neil patrick  doogie howser  harris   who notsosecretly carries a torch for dizzy  and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets  
while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence  johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry  their various battles intertwining with romantic subplots out of a third season episode from  beverly hills    
so if starship troopers is another movie where onedimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens  what makes it any better than  say  independence day  a movie where onedimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens  
for one thing  you sense that the filmmakers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material  
the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate  not just fiscally prudent  
if starship troopers had been turned into a tvmovie  aaron spelling would have produced it  
its a story which requires emoting  not acting  its a prime time soap opera with big guns  played for all the dopey melodrama its worth  
the noname cast also plays into verhoevens treatment of heinleins most controversial conceit  
in this society  we learn  one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service  military for most  
verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service  then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads  named after the world war iiera  why we fight  series  in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms  or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches  
these characters really are just  fresh meat for the grinder   as one character puts it  which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting  
its not that starship troopers is antimilitary  because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big  violent video game  
in fact  the characters are living the propaganda  particularly johnny  who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends   
verhoeven is actually having it both ways  hes making fun of gungho boosterism even as he fires his freshfaced recruits into battle on a gungho booster rocket of visual effects  
if that makes starship troopers hypocritical  at least its enthusiastically staged hypocrisy  
there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film  but it moves like nobodys business  
verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences  sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping  
it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget  i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasnt perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings  
i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers  but it didnt work out that way  
that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material
