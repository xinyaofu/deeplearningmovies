the  italian hitchcock  and acknowledged master of the giallo murdermystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena  
this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino  jennifer connelly   a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects  
sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland  she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the schools population terrified  
a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist  donald pleasance  leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift  
phenomena is an imaginative  original thriller  
writerdirector argento creates several sequences of surreal  haunting beauty here  including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifers beckoning  
the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killers identity is genuinely shocking and surprising  
the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden  exrolling stone bill wyman  and argentos favourite gothicelectronic outfit goblin  
but it gels surprisingly well  
the films opening music reccurs several times  an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone  
argento fans beware  the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form retitled as creepers  
this deleted nearly half an hour of footage  mainly of key dialogue scenes
