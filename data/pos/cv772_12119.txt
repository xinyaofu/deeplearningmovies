true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle headon  which is probably why so few of them do it  
even the most religious directors  like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman  usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms  
so its not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get  the apostle  onto the bigscreen  
as a matter of fact  even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing  and he ended up paying for it with  million of his own money  
he also wrote the script  directed the film  and starred as the central character  a fiery texas preacher named euliss  sonny  dewey  
few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial  technical  and creative responsibility singlehandedly  and its testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall  
and  thankfully  every bit of that personal investment translates onscreen into power and honest emotion  
sonny is an energetic  pentecostal preacher who has been speaking  actually shouting  from behind the pulpit since he was twelve  
he spends much of his time traveling about the country  evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals  
unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers  sonny is not a phony or a swindler  and the films purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church  
duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says  although like all humans  he has weaknesses  
one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that  not only does his longsuffering wife  jessie  farrah fawcett   want to leave him for another man in the congregation  but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher  
faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately his church and his family  that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper  
at his sons baseball game  sonny snaps and smashes his wifes lover in the face with a baseball bat  inflicting a wound that may be fatal  
not knowing what else to do  sonny disappears  
he throws away his identification  drives his car into a lake  and takes a bus to louisiana  hoping to start over again  
in the tiny  mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte  sonny once again finds his calling  
after befriending a simple auto mechanic  walt goggins  and tracking down the towns exminister  john beasley   sonny sets up his own church  the one way to heaven temple  
rechristening himself as  the apostle e  f    he quickly draws together an eager congregation  and together they realize real change in each others lives  
but  always  sonnys past is lurking a step behind him  waiting to swallow his progress  
duvall has made his intentions in making  the apostle  clear  
in a recent article in  newsweek   he wrote   filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit  and when they do  it tends to be patronizing  full of charlatans and snake handlers    
but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe  and to portray it in an accurate way   
the strength of duvalls convictions turn out to be the strength of his film   the apostle  always rings true  even in the most painful moments  because we know hes being sincere with the subject matter  
after fifteen years of traveling the country  listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said  duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual  
his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to  
  ive always called you jesus and youve always called me sonny   he says  
when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs  sonnys mother  june carter cash  just hangs up on them because she knows theres no sense trying to interrupt him  
the main theme to emerge from  the apostle  is the fact that good can come from any situation  
sonnys act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing  and duvall never shrinks from that fact  
however  that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte  where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him  
in his short time in louisiana  he does a world of good  and when the police finally show up to take him away  he goes quietly  knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him  
and  as a scene during the final credits shows  he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment  
it is that strength in sonnys character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others  he is flawed  but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws  
weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves  
watching duvall onscreen  its not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting  
as sonny  he completely inhabits the character  and his performance is certainly the best of the year  
because he spent so much time absorbing the traits  methods  quirks  and personalities of real preachers  duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human  
as a director  duvall feels that less is more  
his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it  with very little intrusion  
there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive closeups  
duvall knew that the power of the films characters  enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly nonprofessional churchgoers and actual ministers  didnt need to be artificially enhanced  
in this way   the apostle  almost plays out like a documentary  not only in its technical simplicity  but more importantly  in its sense of reality
