note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
the teaser trailers for my best friends wedding scarsely gave reason for hope  it looked like the sort of goofy  lighthearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight  but little more  id frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often  
it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friends wedding was such a success  a strong  bouyant romanticcomedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects  featuring a triumphant performance from ms  roberts  
the heroine of my best friends wedding is julianne potter  julia roberts   a successful new york restaurant critic  and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes  rupert everett  that years ago  she had made a pact with her dear best friend and exlover michael oneal  dermot mulroney   a sports writer  that if they both hadnt married by the time they reached   they had promised to marry each other  
both julianne and michael are both single  of course  and when george inquires about michaels age  julianne realizes that hes mere weeks away from his th birthday  and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day  
however  she finds herself even more distraught when michaels call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace  cameron diaz   and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding  julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael  and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary  
the setup for my best friends wedding  then  is a fairly conventional one  and in many ways the films storyline is formulaic  but only to a certain extent  the film was directed by p  j  hogan  whose first feature  muriels wedding  had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting uglyduckling story  and the same holds true for my best friends wedding  which confidently combines traditional romanticcomedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour  
the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr  hogan  
for example  theres a heartfelt  emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film  with a trio of teenagers  inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks  harmonizing in the background  
my best friends wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film  and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect  it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allens everyone says i love you  id even assert its a more successful one  
my best friends wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well  
in a typical romanticcomedy  kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty  conniving ice queen  and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps  this film is smarter than that  here  kimmy is sweet  sincere  and innocent  julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmys life  shed actually like her too  
the george character is almost a staple of recent film  the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason  but in my best friends wedding  he gets to have a playful  mischievous and charming personality  
throughout the film  the formulaisms one often sees is romanticcomedy are given little twists  and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion  
there is a lot of smart writing in the wellpaced screenplay by ronald bass  were given four interesting  vivid  and likeable characters  with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments  
my best friends wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts  who turns in a topnotch  confident and reassured performance as julianne  
this isnt the sort of role one usually associates with ms  roberts  the julianne characters neurotic  fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role  but ms  roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here  remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience  if not entirely sympathetic  even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable  
even better than ms  roberts though is cameron diaz  who turns in a shining performance in my best friends weddding  
with a smile which lights up the screen  she effectively conveys kimmys insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner  and never hits a false note in the film  
she even sings  i wont soon forget her charming serenade of  i just dont know what to do with myself   
rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george  and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film  
his george is a bit of a devilish rogue  entirely affable  and mr  everetts performance is a delight to watch  hes clearly having fun  and his joy is infectuous  
dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role  unlike the other characters in the film  hes not given a lot to do  but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms  roberts and mr  mulroney  and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic  
when julia roberts lustre began to fade  and she was usurped from her title as  americas sweetheart  by sandra bullock  i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile  
while that didnt quite work out  its nearcertain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in   the romanticcomedy  will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game  
my best friends wedding marks a return to form for ms  roberts  and cements p  j  hogans reputation as a skilled director of comedy
