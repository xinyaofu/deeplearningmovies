cinema has been around for about a hundred years now   
its not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film  but id like to think that im beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  
recently  ive seen the films of hitchcock  capra  fellini  godard  kurosawa  chaplin  lang  and many others  
  those men were talented artists  and their films reflect their genius   
they are likely to be remembered for  
  
  
well  quite a while   
i like this film  too   
yes  its a disasterslashaction movie   
true  its budget is a lot more money than ill ever see in my lifetime   
and theres not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money   
in fact  i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film  had they thought it wouldve been more profitable  
i certainly dont care what their intentions were  because michael bay  the rock  is such a skilled director that i doubt hed ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  
of course  skillful direction doesnt complete the package  but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  
the story is wellthought out  and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place   the acting is terrific  the script is sharp  and  get this  there are characters  
yes  you read that right  
armageddon actually has characters you can care about  
if you dont like this film  then you have a problem with the genre itself  armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  
if youve seen deep impact  then you know the basic framework for the story  
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film  
so  its up to the u  s  government to stop it  
  why the u  s  is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated   
their plan  to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid  drill down several hundred feet  and detonate a nuclear warhead within  
the head driller is harry stamper  bruce willis   
his group of men is a colorful bunch  including a  j  
  ben affleck   chick  will patton   and rockhound  steve buscemi   
theres also an interesting triangle formed between a  j   harry  and grace  liv tyler   who is harrys daughter  
a  j  
and grace are  of course  romantically intertwined  and dad isnt too happy with the situation  
its absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is youd like to call armageddon  
its not about story  its about viscera and action  and thrillsaminute  and all that stuff  
its incidental  really  that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable  because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens  
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case  for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better  
i think most of the budget went to cameras alone  because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles  
take the spectacular opening scene  for instance  in which a meteor shower obliterates new york  
a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building  which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars  
the action itself might take five seconds in real life  but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways  
i like his quickedit style  because its abrasive and exhausting to watch  
its also very loud  and obnoxiously noisy at times  
but its fun to be obnoxious sometimes  
the special effects in this film put every other  blockbuster to shame  
deep impact  visually  has absolutely nothing on armageddon  and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable  
special effects are very important in a film like this  if theyre not good  then the image is not convincing  and the film doesnt work  
everything here looks bright and explosive  from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers  all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid  
the effects that dont look totally real are still a pleasure to behold  and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nicelooking that it actually qualifies as art  
of course  all of this would add up to little more than an aboveaverage light show  if i didnt get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action  
the film is two and a half hours long  and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action  
much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots  
i wont suggest that these are complex characters  but their problems are real  and the emotions arent put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way  
in fact  there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up  and thats a lot more than i can say about deep impact  which was banking on the feelgood parts of its story  
bruce willis is terrific  and im glad to see him bigger than life again  recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing   
tyler and affleck are great together  and make a convincing couple  all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level  
patton  who is a magnificent actor  thankfully is not wasted here  and the minor subplot revolving around his exwife and son is very moving  
the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare  who plays a crazy russian astronaut  is nifty  and keeps the film lively and funny  
i wasnt challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon  and i dont mind too much  
but the film doesnt insult my intelligence  its pitched perfectly to entertain  which is what all it really wants to do  
its not mindless and escapist  but wellcrafted cinema  
it might have been created for the wrong reasons  but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good  in spite of the producers and the budget  
im not saying that films like this are risky moves  
what i am saying is that armageddon is a big  loud  expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms
