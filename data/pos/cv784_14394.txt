its no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office  
a poorlywritten script can be bested by a superb acting corps  and a wellwritten piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs  
in directing his latest actioncomedy  director brett ratner  money talks  takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all getout buddy cop movie  
in addition  rush hour serves as a firstclass example of directing a movie with conservative attitude  a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types  
the two lead names share equal screen time here  mostly because they spend it together  
jackie chan  in his first completely american production  makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts  
the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago  knock off  stands no chance against the content of this one  
chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise  and theres no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldnt believe their eyes the first time  
chris tucker  on the opposite side  relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chans performance  
he works perfectly with the script  and its quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines  
almost essential to the action genre  the plot is nonexistent  
were quickly introduced to detective james carter  tucker  is a maverick officer for the lapd  
cut forward to another scene where the daughter  julia hsu  of the american chinese consul  tzi ma  is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters  
the fbi is quick to the rescue  but the consul insists that one of his men  detective inspector lee  chan   be brought on the case to help  
the fbi resists  but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective  
its here that carter and lee hook up  and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up  
rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up  but it doesnt quite reach the top tier of actioncomedies like last years grosse pointe blank  
there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to  and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan  this might be a major drawback  
also  some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride  and others are there simply to look menacing  
however  none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background  
almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another  whether its tuckers toneddown routine or chans tight rein on his action sequences  and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types  
a recommendable visit to the theater  indeed
