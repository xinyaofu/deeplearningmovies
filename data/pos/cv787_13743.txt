if chris farley had strapped some fake muttonchop sideburns to each side of his head  spoken with a thick irish accent  and tried his damnedest to play it straight  he wouldnt have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in  i went down   
gleeson  whos not dissimilar to the late  saturday night live  alumnus in terms of physical attributes  plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film  
bunny is sent to county cork to  retrieve  one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french  well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle   
bunny is to accompany git hynes  peter mcdonald   recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies  
that tom french is a mean bollocks  
he wants frank back  
and a small matter of some     that toms wife was supposed to have given to frank  
for this he wont break anyones thumbs  
maybe  
inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach   i went down  follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs  dimlylit pubs  and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble  
mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that  but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies  most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity   the butcher boy   
even if you cant comprehend half of what theyre saying  gleeson and mcdonald together make  i went down  a trip worth taking  
the film is in many ways reminiscent of another  little  independent feature  s  highway    
that film  too  was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcphersons tale  whimsical observations on life  carefullycrafted vignettes  deadpan conversational asides  and scenes thatll make you laugh out loud  
witness the episode in which our goodnatured protagonists bind frank  played by peter caffrey  to a hotel bed  leaving him with only the tv remote for company  
that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in  highway    
whats also charming about  i went down  is how the relationship between buddy and git develops  
their trip becomes an education for both of them  but the way its handled is neither sappy nor labored  
the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation  via flashbacks  of the relationship between frank and tom  
its a little too hollywood  and what makes  i went down  so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies  
sure its grittymake that grubbybut its also pretty goofy  
although  i went down  emphasizes the comedic elements of disorganized crime  there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter  
dont let these deter you  though   i went down  is a little gem  
its only playing at one philadelphiaarea theaterand i suspect it wont be there for longso catch it while you can
