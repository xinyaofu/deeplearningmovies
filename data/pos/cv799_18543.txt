veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime  his latest directorial effort  
when steve everett  his newest character  gets angry at someone  he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes  furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear whos just lost his cubs  
eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time  but everett could just take the cake  
he gets my vote  at least  partly because ev is a drunken affairaweek womanizer who has many relationship problems  very few of which are with his wife  diane venora   
when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies  everett must take over for her at a vital interview session  
the interview is with frank beacham  isaiah washington   a deathrow inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk  
eastwood furrows his brow  
as everett gradually finds information  he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent  
he interviews a key witness  michael jeter   who claims that he burst in the door at pocums foods because his car had overheated  only to see beacham standing over the dead womans body  blood on his suspenders  gun in hand  
but everett protests  how could he have seen the gun  which was lowered by his side  with the potato chip rack in front of him  
jeter doesnt know what hes talking about  
eastwood furrows his brow  
crinkled expressions and all  clint is the centre of energy of true crime  
the film is by no means a standard actionsuspense yarn  but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shootouts  
isaiah washington has a breakout performance as frank beacham  and scenes with him and his weary wife  lisa gay hamilton  are truly heartfelt moments  
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him  
denis leary  as everetts editor and boss  has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger  you see  ev is sleeping with his wife   
but hands down  the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera  
playing the big boss alan mann  woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laughoutloud punchlines  
when true crime opts for a highspeed chase to the governers house at the finale  the quality of filmmaking takes an abrupt nosedive  
eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didnt need to switch lanes  
true crime is a tensionbuilding  intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star  
this is a road block he could have easily dismissed  i furrow my brow
