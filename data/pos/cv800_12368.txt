those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugos novel les miserables  
i dont know if a lot of people have  though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel  
i havent even seen that  
going into this film  i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters  i even expected the film to be a musical   
walking away from it  im kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material  
writerdirector bille augusts film version is a straightforward  beautifully told film  
liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean  in the beginning  he has just been released from a year prison sentence  
he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior  
the priests words of wisdom influence him  and he makes a vow to change himself  
nine years later  we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo  nobody knows his real name  and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago  
conflicts arise when inspector javert  geoffrey rush  is assigned to vigo  
valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him  and javert remembers jean to be a convict  
javert is hellbent on upholding the law  and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice  
along the way  valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman  fantine  uma thurman   and vows to take care of her daughter  cosette  played later by claire danes   
les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture  
the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast  and the sets dont look like sets  they look like real towns and villages   gabriella pescuccis costumes are noticeably spectacular  
basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually wellplaced  though it does get a bit heavy at times   
many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality  such as the climax  which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening  
augusts keeps the story simple  which i hear is a good thing  since the novel is so complex  and easy to follow  
he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately  
i was also impressed that he didnt go overboard with flash and style  which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days  such as baz luhrmanns vicious tragedy william shakespeares romeo  juliet   
this film feels solid and whole  and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested  
liam neeson is terrific in the main role  neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well  and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective  
thurman  in her small role  is very good  and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very nonglamorous role such as this one  
rush is absolutely incredible as javert  i dont remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here  he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances  and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense  
i cant be as charitable for danes  however  though i know she is a talented actress  here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit  
les miserables is  as ive said  a solid  intelligent motion picture  
my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy  and perhaps too staged  
each scene is grand and huge  and exploding with poledouris score  but i didnt always want them to be  
for the most part  les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture  
its a good movie  and tells its story well  but august tends to handfeed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle  
however  in a film this exciting and wellproduced  a few minor flaws are easily overlooked
