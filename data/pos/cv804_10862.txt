satirical films usually fall into one of two categories    longterm satire where everything  including the jokes  is somehow related on a large scale  i  e  
  dr  
strangelove     situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene  i  e  
  men in black    
whats unique about  wag the dog  is that it doesnt necessarily fit either of these descriptions  and yet is both at the same time  
the result is a clever comedy based on an original  smart premise  even if the focus does tend to wander a bit  
if theres anything that affects americans the most its politics and showbusiness  
in this age of information and technology  weve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things  its gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it  
we need the media to bring us the most uptodate news  but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking  
this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas  and then presents an interesting scenario  if politics  the media coverage of politics  and the entertainment industry are so closely related  couldnt someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all  
thats the idea conrad brean  de niro   a professional washington spin doctor  comes up with in order to restore the presidents good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election  
brean  along with the presidents top advisor  winifred ames  heche   fly to california to meet up with hotshot movie producer stanley motss  hoffman   
they pitch him an idea to  produce  the image of a war with albania  its a country no ones heard of so they people will buy it   
soon the wheels are in motion and the films riffing satire comes into play  
were inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation  such as a folk singer  visual and sound effects technicians  and a modern style expert known as the fad king  leary   
the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv  in the movies  or in the news  
the characters dialogue is witty and funny  although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcomesque  
for example  one scene shows motss and breans production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee  
motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry  but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs  
since its all computerenhanced anyway  she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later  
this demonstrates the films ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise  
but then theres the gags and oneliners that  although are humorous  seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actresss name  or  whenever a problem emerges  always responding with   this is nothing   
by the time the film makes it to the midpoint  everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens  
the first act is quickly paced  while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film  
every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with  and its always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it  
the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems headon in realistic manners  
however  it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject  
as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture  
what had started off as a brilliant  somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie  
still  the situation comedy is quite funny  especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt  
willie schumann  a war hero motss and brean concocted  
truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time  but think about afterwards and  wag the dog  at least succeeds in this respect  
however  in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done  namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes  
then again  its a valiant effort
