mars attacks  
     c  jack nicholson  glenn close  annette bening  martin short  danny devito  rod steiger  pierce brosnan  sarah jessica parker  michael j  fox  jim brown  pam grier  joe don baker  natalie portman  christina applegate  lisa marie  tom jones  
this is director tim burtons finest film to date  
many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day  but even though the stories are similar  they really are two distinctly different films  
however as a whole  mars attacks is much more entertaining than id  and i loved id  
you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film  
it is completely wackedout and unlike anything youve ever seen  
once the silly tone of the film is set  its easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just dont mix  
the plot is simple  martians invade the earth  
but its different than any other invasion film  
usually its the evil aliens versus the heroic humans  
this time however  its the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans  
the martians  who are all computer generated  are just about the funniest things ive seen in a long time  
they look funny  they move funny  and their  language  is hilarious  
and about the special effects  
the effects in mars attacks  
are just about the most flawless ones ive seen to date  
the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem  real  
there are just a couple of scenes that dont work  mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship  
also  glenn close overacts tremendously in her  thankfully  very limited screen time  so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise  
but there are many big laughs in the film  as i said  if you are in the right mood  
could it have been funnier  
certainly  
was it funny enough  
yes  
was i entertained  
absolutely  
on a personal note  id like to thank whomever cast rod steiger  my favorite actor  in the film as warcrazy general decker  
finally  after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles  steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see  
while hes not given the type of role that you can give a real  performance  in  he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue  
the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him
