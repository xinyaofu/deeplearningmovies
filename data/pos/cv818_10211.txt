it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festivals palme dor  a  millionplus box office gross  and an oscar nomination  all for his sophomore outing  pulp fiction  
since then  the talented film maker has been virtually invisible  surfacing briefly as a codirector of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampirefest  from dusk till dawn  
in between  he has moonlighted as an  actor  with several decidedly unmemorable performances  
now  with much fanfare and anticipation  tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort  jackie brown  
and  while this motion picture  adapted from elmore leonards novel  rum punch  offers solid entertainment  those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed  
for the most part  jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie  
the story  which starts out slowly  develops into a twisty affair  with doublecrosses and triplecrosses  
and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks  witty dialogue  unexpected gunfire  s pop tunes  and closeups of womens bare feet  
yet  for all of that  the production is something of a letdown  
the sheer  inyourface exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent  
the mostlystraightforward chronology of jackie brown doesnt match up favorably to the nonlinear style of tarantinos previous efforts  an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives  
and there arent nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around  
theres a samuel l  jackson monologue about guns  a jacksonchris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk  and a jacksonrobert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jacksontravolta material from pulp fiction  but thats about it  
jackie browns lone  innovation  is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives  
this isnt exactly an original technique  it has been done numerous times before  most famously in akira kurosawas rashomon and most recently in edward zwicks courage under fire  
however  while in those two movies  and others   there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple pointsof view  tarantinos sole purpose for using it appears to be because its unconventional  
had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages  nothing would have been lost  
as a result  this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity  
for the second picture in a row  tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a s icon  
this time around  instead of john travolta  its blaxploitation queen pam grier  foxy brown has become jackie brown   
in one of many nods to the most famous segment of griers career  tarantino uses a s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits  
there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre  although grier never does any buttkicking   
grier is jackie brown  a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states  
shes working for gun dealer ordell robbie  samuel l  jackson   but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning  despite pressure from ray nicolet  michael keaton   a federal official  
no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie  ordell arranges for a bail bondsman  max cherry  robert forster  tvs  banyon   to post the necessary     then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal  
jackie passes ordells test  however  and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle    of ordells money into the united states without tipping off the feds  
soon  just about everyone is after that money  including jackie  max  ray  ordells perpetually oversexed and druggedout girlfriend  melanie  bridget fonda   and his righthand man  louis  robert de niro   
unsurprisingly  the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l  jackson  but ordell isnt nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction  
in addition to looking fantastic  pam grier is also quite good  although hers is not an oscar caliber performance  although she might get a nomination   
robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their toughguyswhorarely smile roles  
bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons  to look sexy in a bikini  to provide a little twisted comedy  and to satisfy tarantinos foot fetish  
robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking  middleaged actor  
the film  which clocks in at several minutes over the twoanda half hour mark  is probably too long for the material  but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout  although the payoff is a letdown   
tarantino keeps things moving along nicely  with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction  but  on the whole  this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself  
when it comes to recent caper films  like the grifters and bound   jackie brown is a secondtier effort  
its an entertaining diversion  but not a masterpiece  and certainly not an oscar contender
