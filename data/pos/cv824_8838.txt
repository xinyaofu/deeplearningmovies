in may of   just  years after steven spielbergs success with jaws and  years after francis coppolas the godfather  a risky  ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success  
little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film  
in january of this year  lucas rereleased star wars on its th anniversary  
in this new  remastered version  the added effects  which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computergenerated jabba the hutt  dont do much but call attention to themselves  
other than these  the film is exactly the same  
why pay to see it in the theaters  you might ask  
simply because when this movie was released  most of us were a few years short of being born  
we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience  especially if you havent seen it  
the plot is basic but in the same way  complex  
it has many themes  but the one rotates around luke skywalker  mark hamill  and his quest to become a jedi knight  
his mission begins when a droid named rd plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia  carrie fisher   which tells him to contact the mysterious obiwan kanoby  alec guiness   
he and kanoby then  joined by two intergalactic renegades  hans solo  harrison ford  and chewbacca  and skywalkers two droids d and cpo  the voice of anthony edwards   wage war upon the corrupt empire  commanded by an evil general  peter cushing  and the traitorous darth vader  the voice of james earl jones   
skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger  the force  
the film is obviously quite starstudded  
but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones voice would appear so many more times in the future  
it just happened to work out for him  
the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalkers triumph is symbolized by the audiences sense of becoming something larger than life itselfa universe of fans  young and old  recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever
