strange days chronicles the last two days of  in los angeles  
as the locals gear up for the new millenium  lenny nero  ralph fiennes  goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips  
he pines for his exgirlfriend  faith  juliette lewis   not noticing that another friend  mace  angela bassett  really cares for him  
this film features good performances  impressive filmmaking technique and breathtaking crowd scenes  
director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it  
but as a whole  this is an unsatisfying movie  
the problem is that the writers  james cameron and jay cocks  were too ambitious  aiming for a film with social relevance  thrills  and drama  
not that ambitious filmmaking should be discouraged  just that when it fails to achieve its goals  it fails badly and obviously  
the film just ends up preachy  unexciting and uninvolving
