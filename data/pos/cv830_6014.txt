for more than a decade  anjelica huston has been one of americas finest actresses  
in her directorial debut  bastard out of carolina  based upon dorothy allisons largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south  huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well  
the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright  nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth  in postworld war ii south carolina  
through voiceover  narration done by laura dern   we find that she nearly didnt survive birth  as her single mother anney  played by jennifer jason leigh  was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident  
thats just the beginning of her troubles  
bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate  a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come  
anney meets and weds lyle  a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident  
anneys brother earle  played by michael rooker  introduces her to glen  played by ron eldard  a coworker at the mill  
glen  the black sheep of a wealthy family   when are you gonna make your daddy proud  
ill tell you when  never   
hes told  and filled with bitterness  courts anney and eventually wins her  despite warnings of a violent temper  
when anney miscarries with his muchprized baby boy  glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone  beating and abusing her  while the lovedependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour  
things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment  
while set several decades ago  this story remains completely relevant in todays society  where abused wives return to their husbands  and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other  
the real star of this domestic drama is not topbilled jennifer jason leigh  but child actress jena malone  who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance  
her work is of awardcalibre  and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged  kirsten dunst  tina majorino  anna paquin  natalie portman  christina ricci  elijah wood   malones performance stands up well  
leighs performance in bastard out of carolina is fine  although shes not really given much to do  and ron eldard work is very solid  skillfully manouvering his characters moods in and out of explosive rage  
one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressurecooker ticking away  
of the supporting cast  special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rookers performance  
theres a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste  from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms  to the familiar sight of a driedup uptight wise old granny  played by grace zabriskie  sitting on the porch rocking chair  to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance  
still  it cannot be denied that anne merediths screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power  
hustons direction of the film is surehanded and impressive  giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast  particularly the young malone  
her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hardhitting emotional  rather than graphic  manner  and are very effective  
hustons talent with camera positioning is wonderful  from a visually striking shot done through a fan  to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile  
the film has the toneddown feel of a television production  bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station  who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience  
perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant  but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing
