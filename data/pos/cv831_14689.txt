official release  halloween

you think you know all about vampires    believe 
me    you 
know f  ck all   
with these words  we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver  played by eileen daly   
made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake  she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being  
so  whats an undead girl to do  except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible  get out her guns  seduce a few guys  and kill a few people for money and blood  
with that out of the way  let me say this  
this film is bad  
this film is really  really bad  
yet somehow  it is strangely enjoyable  
with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick  buxom babes  gore  cheesy dialogue  and bad acting  any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade  
still  it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film  
agreed  it might be  but is far from being the best vampire flick ever  
period  
razor blade smile has some rather high production values  shown by the nice overall tone to the film  
the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore  with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating  doesnt sleep in a coffin  but leaves one next to her computer   and sees religion as the opium of the peoples  hence  immunity to crosses   
but aside from that  it doesnt stray too far away from horror film conventions  
that is  unless that is intentional  
razor blade smile literally goes for the throat  then pumps the wound full of processed cheese  
you cant help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle  
youll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations  to distract two female guards  lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number   
youll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably  
and then  theres the sudden twist ending  i have enough heart not to give it away   
the film refuses to take itself seriously  which is a good thing  as by the time lilith zips up her skintight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage  youve most likely forgotten the main point of the story  
but in case you really care  shes been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the socalled illuminati  and shes leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find  
as much as my criticisms  this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups  
almost destined for cultstatus  the films campy  cheesy overtones actually work towards the film  
while this may not necessarily be the film youd want to be seen watching by yourself  it makes for a fun time at the movies
