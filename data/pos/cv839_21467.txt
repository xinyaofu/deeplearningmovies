assume nothing  
the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the s  as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be  
the phrase especially goes for oscar novak  an architect who is the main focus of three to tango  a delightful  funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself  
novak  matthew perry   a shy  clumsy  chicago based architect  along with openly gay partner  peter steinberg  oliver platt   fights for projects day in and day out  
one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman  dylan mcdermott   a rich  wellknown businessman  
charles immediately takes a liking to oscar  as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor  
seeing oscar as someone he could trust  charles asks him to watch his girlfriend  an unpredictable  adventurous girl named amy post  neve campbell   who makes a living by blowing glass  
charles wants to know who she talks to  what she does  and where she goes  
the point  
to make sure shes not seeing someone else  of course  
oscar gladly takes the job  and meets amy at an art show of hers  and sparks fly between the two from the get go  
oscar feels he has found the one meant for him  and he is content with the idea of being with amy  
well  another popular phrase of the s is  all good things must come to an end   and this stays true for oscar as well  
charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night  as oscar and amy have become great friends  but he doesnt seem to mind  
why is this  
he thinks oscar is gay  
hes not afraid to share this with him either  
oscar stands in shock after the words   i swear if you werent gay oscar  id have to kill you   are muttered flamboyantly from charles mouth  
the word spreads instantly through town  
will oscar  come out  of his supposed gayness  or will he tell everyone that he isnt  
one would immediately think he would deny the fact  but numerous occurrences come to oscar  which result in the fact that if he denies the fact  he could lose his job with charles  
matthew perry doesnt escape his character as chandler on the already classic t  v  
comedy  friends   as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless  shy  and sensitive  
nonetheless  perry is hilarious here  and shows that he can handle drama  as obviously  his character suffers quite a bit here  
its wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie   she was the star of scream  and   and the upcoming scream   as she handles comedy superbly here  
her voice  smile  and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies stay with this genre  neve  
neve is delightful as her conflicted character  who feels love for oscar  but knows  based on rumors  that he is gay  
as usual  campbell is likable as her likable character  
unlike the other two leads here  dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue  and is never convincing  
when his character his present  mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting  
stick to the t  v  
drama  the practice  dylan  
the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano  
no originality or technique is used whatsoever  
three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy  or else the film would have been a disaster  as it is just plain boring to look at  
three to tango is a film done many times before  as the plot is suspiciously close to s the object of my affection  but the plot has never been completed so well  
three to tangos script  written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun  fast  and funny  delivering not only original  hilarious gay jokes  not your run of the mill material   but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling  
unlike last summers south park  bigger  longer  and uncut and s in  out  three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar  
the script is wise to take this route  as gays cant  i dont think so  anyway  be offended by this light  playful comedy  
  to prove this  a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly   
three to tangos climax is a hilarious  clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romanticmistaken identity comedies  
three to tango is a gem  
the bottom line  three to tango is a light  sharp  snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending  and great stars  
one of the better romantic comedies of
