lets face it  since waterworld floated by  the summer movie season has grown  very  stale  
with no new eyecandy for four weeks straight  weve had to sustain ourselves on the quasinutritional value of cheatin husbands  traveling chocolate salesmen  and computer generated serial killers  
sigh  
thank god for desperado  
the freewheeling sequel to el mariachidirector robert rodriguezs notorious  debutstars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name  
hes a man in black with revenge on his mind  and an arsenal in his case  
  the woman he loved was killed in the first film   
so  he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers  sort of a texmex version of the punisher  if you will  
there isnt much of an emotional core to desperado  
rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo  
  and sergio leone    
and sam peckinpah     
some may wince at the body countat least  graphic killings is a fair estimatebut its all played for laughs  
big  broad  hispanic laughs that  for me  recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films  
sick  slick fun
