if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie  from dusk till dawn would probably be it  
scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez  desperado   the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence  and is incredibly fun to watch  
it starts off as a pulp fictiontype crime story  with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store  
because this is a tarantino movie  however  its not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot  its a case of a hole being shot through someones hand  a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away  
the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie  everything overdone and nothing as it seems  
clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it  
harvey keitel plays the backslidden expreacher and juliette lewis his daughter  whom registered sexpervert tarantino eyes endlessly  
you know youre mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive  although shes not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn  
the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border  clooneys strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet  
it does its trick  the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind  never noticing clooney or tarantino  
once they get to mexico  its time to wait at the rendezvous point  a topless bar called titty twister where were once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper  
finally  after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him  the stripper turns into a vampire  
soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back  
thats right  weve come all this way to see a vampire movie  
but like everything else  tarantino takes this ageold genre and twists it to his own ends to produce overthetop entertainment  
so we get holy water condom balloons  heads rolling  quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes  a lap dog of satan   
the from dusk till dawn dialogue is  tarantino  hovering between absurd and disgusting  as when theyre entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister   but always entertaining  and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more secondrate gorefest  
clooney  keitel and especially tarantino are so overthetop with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious  ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously  
stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie  but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people  even if theres absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn  
pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason  but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment  
from dusk till dawn isnt the classic of modern cinema that pf is  but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie
