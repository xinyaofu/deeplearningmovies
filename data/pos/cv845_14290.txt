when i saw the trailer for this film  i laughed harder than i had in quite some time  
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it  i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good  
im happy to say that theres something about mary is not one of those trailer letdowns  
in fact  watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours  
the film opens up in flashback to   at a high school in cumberland  rhode island  
ted stroehmann  ben stiller  is a social reject who cant seem to get a date to the upcoming prom  until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren  w  
earl brown   whos being harassed by one of the school jocks  
it seems warrens sister is the campus queen  mary jensen  cameron diaz   who is impressed with teds willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother  despite a very real chance of getting beaten up  
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom  
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name  
unfortunately  prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper  at which every man in the theater will wince   and is sent to the hospital  
fast forward to the present  where ted has cleaned himself up  now writes for a magazine  but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past  years  mary  whom he hasnt seen since that fateful day  
with the help of his friend dom  chris elliott   ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy  matt dillon  to track down his only love  
however  when pat finds mary  he falls for her too  and soon the both of them are competing for her affections  
theres something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly  who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin  
not exactly intelligent comedies  they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or coworkers to think you had such a great time watching them  
with their current film  the farrelly brothers have come up with something youll not only enjoy  but also wont mind talking about the next day at the water cooler  
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles  from the subtle to the ridiculous  and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some  seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films  they almost all work  
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on  
one minute youll be laughing at something ted says  and the next youll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of marys apartment  
one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller  
he is perfectly cast in the role of ted  because hes a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation  
teds a nice fellow and tries to do his best  but for some reason or another things just dont always work out  
its comical  but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top  
actually  ive liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mideighties  
the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruisepaul newman film the color of money  entitled the hustler of money  
in it  stiller played wince  not vince  who is taken under the wing of an older man  played by john mahoney  to become a bigtime bowling hustler  
it was parody at its finest  more of which showed up in the shortlived  the ben stiller show  on the fox network in late early   
like  the critic   which aired on abc  then fox   i still mourn that shows cancellation  
cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film  although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates  and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paperthin at times  
however  diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm  that you can still see why shes got guys just falling over each other to be with her  
heck  i even found her laugh to be cute  even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week  
my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesnt change  and you know  its really true  
he and ralph macchio must hang out or something  
maybe they live in dick clarks pool house  
anyway  heres another good piece of casting  as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into marys heart  
the supporting performances are also good  
chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss  yes  check it out next time   and less annoying than in cabin boy  
lin shae  who plays marys neighbor magda  and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin   provides some good laughs  especially in scenes with her benjilike dog  which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film  
lee evans  as marys friend tucker  displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist  
the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j  strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there arent any noticeable times where the film drags  
the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes  
they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plotrelevant information right toward the camera  
its a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film  
after that it got a little annoying  and its unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow  
fortunately  filled with sight gags  humorous lines  and solid comedic acting  theres something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater
