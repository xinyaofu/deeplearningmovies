clint eastwood  in his ripe old age  is cashing one talent in for another  
midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwooddirected film clint isnt even in  and its damn good  
adapted from a bestselling john berendt novel based on true events  this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah  where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head  
and thats just the mayor  
as director and producer  eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent  minutes  neatly balancing drama  suspense and humor  
like all great movies  midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves  and not from some contrived  juvenile intrusion  
the acting  from bigtime stars john cusack and kevin spacey  is as good as youd expect  but its the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm  
cusack plays a freelance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town  country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spaceys parties  
lots of food  beverages and gunplay  
yes  an employee of spaceys has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead  
it seems like a simple matter of self defense  the guy threatened spacey  shot at him  missed  then spacey took him out  but being a movie  theres much more to it than that  and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder  a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in  
the weird circle of entertainment  
this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in  
theres the requisite sexy woman  alison  nepotists daughter  eastwood   the strange piano player  the voodoo woman and the transvestite  
miss chablis deserves a paragraph of hisher own  as the stealer of every scene she appears in  what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony  
chablis  playing herself  is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul  but never seems exploited as the movies comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie  
there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes  which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie  but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating  
certainly the characterizations of the judge and spaceys lawyer both help immensely  as does having the flyguy as the jurys foreman  
its here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spaceys homosexuality  
yes  spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man  before he shot him  of course  
midnight in the garden of good and evil isnt a classic  but it is one of the better celebritydirected  truestory bestseller adaptations out there  
likewise  no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations  but the performances are all great  
in fact  id almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category  
serving america for more than th of a century
