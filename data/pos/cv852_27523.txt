being the selfproclaimed professional film critic that i am  i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia  coming soon to dvd  until only recently  
after all  its considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean  who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai  and doctor zhivago  
so one day  a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it  
i was initially skeptical that something made almost  years ago would be able to keep my attention for the buttnumbing   hours of its duration  
but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against  the winner of seven academy awards in  for best picture  director  editing  cinematography  art direction  music  and sound  
after watching the film again  i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen  
based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t  e  
lawrence during world war i  lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence  played by thenunknown actor peter otoole  as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever  
bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building  lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be reassigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army  
lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i  
shot in panavisions famed super mm format  the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic  
it is absolutely breathtaking  
using stunning cinematography  costuming  and direction  shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth  i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in  and watch this story unfold before my eyes  
every shot is choreographed as a portrait  a living tribute to a great land  
david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed  and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time  a far cry from its pathetic  uncreative existence today  
after watching the film  the first thing that came to my mind was   ive got to do a remake of this film   
but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modernday movie executive   okay  its going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert  
we are going to need to blow up a fullsize train because computergenerated effects probably wont do it justice  
and we are not going to use any big stars  and wont have any female actors since theres no love story   
yes  my friends  the velvet curtain fell on the goldenera of hollywood a long time ago  
but at least we still have the proof to show all wouldbe producers and directors out there just how good a film can be
