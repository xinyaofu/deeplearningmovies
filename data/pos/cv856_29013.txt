colleague norm schrager nailed session   brad andersons throwback to spooky horror films from the s  
it worked as an eerie homage without being selfreferential or smugly postmodern  
genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubricks the shining and george romeros dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative  i  e   a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum  unspeakable dread ensues   
in a doublewhammy for   anderson shoots and  mostly  scores again with his eclectic riff on timetravel episodes from the twilight zone  appropriately titled happy accidents  
much like session   the cards are played very close to the vest here  
is boyish  eccentric  sam deed from dubuque  iowa  a futuristic voyager from the year  or just your runofthemill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the presentday streets of nyc  
as played by wonderful character actor vincent donofrio  full metal jacket   its up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted  
the question proves to be moot  at least for a time  
even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion  one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend  ruby  marisa tomei    hes a freak  but he sure tells a good story   
neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters  the junkie  the fetishist  the artist  the frenchman  etc    but isnt quite sure how to handle  sam deed  when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm  his elaborately constructed fake identity  his pathological fear of dogs  his ability to speak five different languages  and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on times alternate realities  
  dont ask   
its all a bit much to take in  
rubys close friend gretchen  cuz ya cant have a love story without the token friend  though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth  chalks it up as a sexy roleplaying game  but her cautious therapist  holland taylor  warns her that codependency is rearing its ugly head again and shes in over her head with yet another doomed relationship  
who ya gonna believe  
despite her winning an academy award  marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence  one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents  
her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear  cute  to her adoring fans  
being loud and flashing a  disingenuous  smile does not necessarily equal  substantial and sexy   
it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality  
then theres that damned voice  which strains to be ohsoadorable  
look  this stuff is purely subjective  
some people feel this way about richard gere  others cannot bear to watch robin williams hyperactive schtick  
for my money  its m  tomei with a bullet  
happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys  or  more appropriately  chris markers la jetee  especially with those still framed  memory  photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout   
modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly  vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logans run  
as the stranger in a strange land  donofrio walks slightly outofstep  wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment  
this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion  though it often falls into the scifi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition  we want deeds  not words   
at least twenty minutes too long  happy accidents eventually gets around to a raceagainsttime scenario that puts  sam deed  to the ultimate test  
no movie can live in ambiguity forever  but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives  
  lets pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened  shall we   
there are also some slow  repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not hes crazy  
the premise is strong enough to sustain interest  but its enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in halfhour time slots  commercials included
