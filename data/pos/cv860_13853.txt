the verdict  spinechilling drama from horror maestro stephen king  featuring an outstanding  oscarwinning performance from kathy bates  
geez  french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this  
sorry  nonbritish readers may not be familiar with french and saunders  my apologies  
the pair are british comediennes  jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in  absolutely fabulous    who did a series of film spoofs a few years back  including alien  the exorcist and misery  
needless to say  amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates  the resemblance was quite uncanny    dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunders legs  
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch  and although ive now seen the film a couple of times now  that  hobbling  scene was no less disturbing  
im still left screaming at the telly in revulsion  
that may be the most memorable scene  but its certainly not the only worth watching  
stephen king  whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality  strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale  
its a nicely crafted psychological horror  which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon  james caan   
rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes  bates   who introduces herself as the writers  number one fan   he soon becomes her prisoner  
both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance  for which she won an oscar  work arminarm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruitcake  or is that fruity as a nutcake    
bates relishes her demanding role  and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece  
at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour  at times shes a rather tragic character  and more often than not shes just damned scary  
this is basically a very simple tale  but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity  
its an involving  engrossing experience  and considering its basically a twohander  mainly set in one locale  its a remarkable piece of cinema  
there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences  this one relies solely upon rob reiners stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan  
oh  i havent really mentioned caan yet  he does a good job as the writer whos a prisoner of his own success  annie is obsessed with him and his books   
but  as you no doubt gathered from the above  bates is well and truly the star of the show  
along with the pig  of course  
anyway  the tension is builtup with masterful aplomb  and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense  
theres the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerveshattering lengths to poison her wine  
he succeeds  but    she 
knocks the glass over  
i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well  
in the immortal words of homer j  simpson   doh    
other nervewracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house  
we cut to annie in her car  shes on her way home    he 
realises this and tries to get back to his room    cut 
to the car again  shes getting near    will he make it  
ok  so these sequences arent exactly original  nor perhaps unpredictable  but they work  
boy  do they work  
if a film has you on the edge of your couch  biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense  then its doing something right  
of course  the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned  hobbling   
annie realises her captive has been out of his room  and shes going to stop him once and for all  
cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer  and    i feel ill just thinking about it  
nasty  
it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand  and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho  
and then were given one of the most ridiculously overthetop fight scenes ive ever seen  
she gets hit over the head with a typewriter  set on fire  head smashed against the wall  and she just wont die  
sheldon isnt in terribly good shape either  
if it werent so gorey it would almost be laughable  
but its a terrifically effective film  and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked  
misery is a tight  tense  intense and chillingly entertaining thriller  
the directing is firstrate  and the performances  bates in particular  contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem  
wonderful stuff
