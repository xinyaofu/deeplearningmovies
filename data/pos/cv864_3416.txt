after a successful run in australia last year  and with much critical praise heaped upon it  muriels wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america  
muriel heslop is a withdrawn  overweight young woman living in porpoise spit  australia  
she is often the target of her fathers frequent rants at the family  and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage  
her selfloathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success  marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired  
after her four cliquey friends dump her  muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls  and muriels wedding unfolds from there  
toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance  conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted  
collette gained a frightening  pounds in order to play the chubby title character  
she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma  easily winning the audience over with an honest  painful performance  
collette basically carries the film  appearing in almost every scene  
muriels father  bill  the battler  heslop  is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politiciandeveloper  
while chumming around with young fans and crowing you cant beat progress  his slogan   bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments  
rachel griffiths plays rhonda  who becomes muriels cheeky new friend in the film  
she has good chemistry with collette  and the film suffers when griffiths is offscreen  
muriels tormenters  played by pippa grandison  rosalind hammond  belinda jarrett and sophie lee  are twodimensional caricatures  all saucy  vain and bumblingly spiteful  though that is probably due to hogans scripting 
muriels wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm  
hogans use of abba tunes  which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack  is interestingly appropriate  although its repetitiveness tires after awhile  
hogans script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriels earnest quest for acceptance  and the gorgeous scene with muriel windowshopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her  
the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch  
muriels wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming  if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p  j  hogan  
on my four star scale  i give muriels wedding three stars
