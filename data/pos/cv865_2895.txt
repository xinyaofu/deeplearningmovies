every once in a while  a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise  
i dont necessarily mean in terms of quality  rather  im referring to the mere knowledge of its existence  
usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance  but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo  
it has slipped rather quietly into limited release  and appears destined to slip out just as quietly  
thats a shame  because princess caraboo is a delightful fable  romantic  gentle and very appealing  
whats more  its surprisingly insightful and provides a sharpwitted lesson in english social history  
princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early th century england  involving a young woman  phoebe cates  who is found wandering the countryside  
apparently unable to speak any english  she is taken in by goodhearted gentlewoman mrs  worrall  wendy hughes   
her banker husband  jim broadbent  is nonetoopleased about this strange houseguest  until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island  the princess caraboo  
this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr  worrall  and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs  worrall  
however  local journalist john gutch  stephen rea  is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be  and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo  
as a social satire and comedy of manners  princess caraboo is a winner  
it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars  and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing  
but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr  worrall  a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude  
he is worse than one of the idle rich  he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them  and since the house and money are all from mrs  worrall  he is a bit too close to them for comfort  
while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule  director and cowriter michael austin keeps the treatment too lighthearted to be heavyhanded  
he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes  as the princess becomes a  sensation  at court  
in one of the films best sequences  princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent  a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions   and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance  
it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in  sensations   an idea that takes on a timeless quality  and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show   
social commentary aside  princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment  
the performers are mostly delightful  particularly phoebe cates  who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime  
her supporting players are also appealing  wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs  worrall  kevin kline as frixos  the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler  stephen rea as the worldweary but ultimately romantic gutch  
only john lithgow is a disappointment  turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princesss identity  
the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt  without becoming gimmicky  
it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isnt given more time to develop  because the potential seemed to be there  
when it finally does blossom  it seems too quick to be plausible  
princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp  
still  it has both escapist and intellectual appeal  and is well worth seeking out  
it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewardinga hidden gem
