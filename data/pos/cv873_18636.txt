in roger michells romantic comedy notting hill  william thacker  hugh grant  leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends its name to the films title  
one day  american movie superstar anna scott  julia roberts  walks in to purchase a book on turkey  
quickly enamored of each other  the two embark upon an onagain  offagain love affair replete with romance  humor  and the occasional lump in the throat  
the film opens with a nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres  coming out of limousines  walking the red carpets and such  
without words  this sequence gives us a background to her character  
following  however  is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives  
i dont know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldnt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film  and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning  but there it is  
if there were ever a clear case for  less is more   this would be it  
the film is told nearly first person from williams point of view  as he is in every scene  
by nature of this arrangement  we get a very definite sense of what he is all about  and his nice guy personality wins us over easily  
in fact  much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis  
a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that hes even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator  
or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image  
william assures her he wouldnt say a word  then adds   well  ill probably tell myself now and then  but id never believe it   
great stuff  
the downside to spending so much time with william is that we dont get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible  
were constantly exposed to williams thoughts  feelings  actions and desires  but dont actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him  
there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest  but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what shes been thinking all the times in between  
this  combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two  makes this hugh grants film hands down  
he gets the great scenes  look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna   the great lines  and gives an overall wonderful performance  
julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film  ala sandra bullock in a time to kill  along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior  
anna doesnt get a lot of our compassion  
this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance  much of it supplied by grant himself  but with considerable help from the supporting cast  
most notable is rhys ifans as spike  williams eccentric roommate  who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh  
hugh bonneville  emma chambers  james dreyfus  and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family  particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner  and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst  
its a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation  
roger michells use of visuals doesnt sweep us off our feet  but does give us more than your typical movie of this type  
for example  there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass  
whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying  eight months later   michell presents us with more interesting cues  such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him  
another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air  
were generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so  but in this case  the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a birds eye view of the ground below  
music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes  and some of this might have been better toned down  but in other areas it works to full effect  
its kind of a mixed bag  but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video  
at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate  
notting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings  but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it  
for a couple of hours  you should expect to laugh more than cry  and thats not so bad  now is it
