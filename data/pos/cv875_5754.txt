every once in a while  when an exceptional family film comes along  i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been  with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children  it is remarkable how many nondisney films disappear in a couple of weeks  
now i see that in so doing  i have unfairly ghettoized these films  
so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents  but to anyone who wants to support smart  funny  energetic filmmaking  see matilda  
see it in a theater  rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video  
see the best film i have seen in   
not the best childrens film    the 
best film  
period  
based on a story by roald dahl  it tells of young matilda wormwood  mara wilson   an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents  harry  danny devito   a crooked used car salesman  and zinnia  rhea perlman   a simpleminded bingo addict  
the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists  and when they do  it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books  
when they finally do send her to school  it is to crunchem hall  a bleak place run by cruel  childhating miss agatha trunchbull  pam ferris   
but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher  miss honey  embeth davidtz   who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness  
matilda also discovers another special talent  the ability to move things with her mind  which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbulls cruelty  
it was this springs james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them  and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda  
and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton  matilda soars on the cockeyed direction of danny devito  
devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses  and he contributes some memorable images  
in one scene  an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pigtails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer  later  an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert  
matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale  
it is also characteristic of the best childrens tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost dont realize that they are learning them  
there is a hilarious moment when matildas televisionaddicted father snatches away the book she is reading  in a wicked joke  he thinks moby dick is pornographic  and forces her to watch an inane game show  hosted by jon lovitz  in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around  
matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment  and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child  that because  im big and youre little  im right and youre wrong   
more specifically  it has as its heroine an intelligent  selfconfident girl who struggles successfully against other peoples notions of how she should behave  
it is no coincidence that matilda was cowritten by robin swicord  who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women  
finally  matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment  it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word  
devito knows enough to make matilda fastpaced and appealing to children  taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy  including a great chase through her dark house  
the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable  with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character  
but there are also many  many delights for adults  including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matildas classmates recite in singsong fashion  there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matildas father  
i cant imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted  
matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling  
i will see it again  and years from now i will watch it with my children  
and now i will stop  because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin  and there is a seat in that theater you should be in  if you have a child or ever were a child
