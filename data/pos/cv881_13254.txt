the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all  
what does takes place is more based on character development  
the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people  nick  beth  carol and sid  
what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at  
nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield  arizona to butte  montana  
  and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different     
carol is nicks exgirlfriend and beths best friend  sid is a jointsmoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in  
obviously based on a stage play  the problem with the movie is that theres a lot of things left out  
its not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other  the reason why nick was fired from his job isnt mentioned  
and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery  when he hasnt seen them for many years  
set in a small  fictional   
town in arizona was a good move  since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings  
the name of the city is not important  this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future  
particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her  
not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with  but ill keep an eye on her in the future  
interesting trivia  this was rated r in the us but rated barntill  ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it
