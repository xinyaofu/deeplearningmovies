bob the happy bastards quickie review  
the mummy 
brendan frasers stuck in the past again  but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone    
fraser is the lead star of the mummy  the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers  who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising   
its a rough adaptation of the  film  and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages  like boris karloff was engulfed in  
but who cares  the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you cant get from  oh  say  godzilla or armageddon  
fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground  
basically  its a little sign from the mummy buried underneath a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress  
his plan wake back up and wake her up also  making him invincible  
of course  fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian  rachel weisz  and her brother  john hanna   along with a former buddy of his  deep risings kevin j  oconnor  and some  americans     and 
guess what  
yup  ihmoetep  arnold vosloo  awakens and wreaks havoc  
fire flies from the sky  flesheating beetles crawl about  and  well  ihmoeteps plan begins to unfold  
ok  so its not really all that new a story  but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough  
the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch  and the acting from fraser and weisz isnt half bad either  
the action is pretty intense  favorite scene  the sandstorm  and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horrorloving folks as well  
no  its no phantom menace beater  but if youre looking for a solid warmup to the summer movie season  you wont find a better film under wraps than the mummy  
if this doesnt give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man  then nothing will
