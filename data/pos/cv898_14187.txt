a cinematic version of one of john irvings novels is always cause for celebration even if  as in the case of  simon birch   the treatment is merely  suggested by   rather than strictly based on  the book  
suggested means that irving  author of the acclaimed  the world according to garp   sold the rights to his novel  a prayer for owen meany  to the disney machine for  million  but wouldnt grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names  
thats an odd decisionirving claims its to protect both himself and the novelbut its one that doesnt unduly harm the finished product  
irvings books are rich and complex works  full of intriguing  colorful characters  
  a prayer for owen meany  is no exception  it tells the story of an unusual boycalled simon birch in the film versionwho is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a highpitched falsetto voice   like strangled mice   
simon believes himself to be  gods instrument   placed on this earth to somehow effect gods plan  
simon is played by ian michael smith  who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which  among other things  prevents bones  ligaments  and joints from developing normally  
smiths debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for  simon birch   however  the producers unwisely favored form over functionsmiths acting abilities are limited at best  
another drawback is that in the book  simons condition is described the way irving describes any of his charactersin careful  loving detail  
watching  simon birch   however  creates a different feeling altogether  the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character  surely something irving would not have intended  
simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating  a combination of smiths rookie status as an actor and the precocious oneliners hes forced to deliver  courtesy mark steven johnson  the films director and screenwriter  
fortunately  simon birch isnt the real star of the film that bears his name  
simon is more of a catalyst  allowing his costars to shape the story  and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances  saving the film from an obsequious  manipulative destiny  
first and foremost is joseph mazzello   jurassic park    who is nothing less than remarkable as simons best friend  joe  
mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a  year old  ripe with laughter  pain  and tears  he is certainly an emerging talent  
ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca  joes single mother  and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend  ben  
david strathairn and jan hooks play the towns reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others  
theres even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from    
well  that would be telling  
perhaps  suggested by  the novel is the appropriate way to go after all  since  simon birch  only focuses on one chapter  one year  of simons extraordinary life  
the film also changes the books ending to one that is more melodramatic  yet necessary given simons lot  
the flavor of irvings original novel remains  howeverthe passions  friendships  and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown  maine  and the engaging oddballs  both big and small  who reside there
