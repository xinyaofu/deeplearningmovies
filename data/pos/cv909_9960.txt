gere  willis  poitier chase each other around the world 
the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman 
when the soviet union imploded  the western countries lost their shadow  
with the united states friendly with the russians  we no longer had an entity to blame for the worlds problems  
this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy  
its time to rejoice because weve found our new villain  
now its no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands  its the russian mafia  
a perfect solution  it combines the dread of organized crime and the stillpresent uneasiness with the former eastern block countries  
best of all  the villains are still foreigners  fear of the other always plays best  
so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal  bruce willis  to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid  
the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone theyre not sure even exists  
coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen  richard gere  who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston  sidney poitier  and russian major valentina koslova  diane venora   
mulqueens exgirlfriend basque terrorist isabella  mathilda may  is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal  
  presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met   
the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his  million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesnt slip away  
crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his minivan  the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers  
being very loosely based on the same book the  thriller  the day of the jackal   comparison between the two films is inevitable  
there is no doubt that the original is the better movie  playing the story for suspense rather than the current actionadventure  
as a mystery   the jackal  has enough holes in it to ruin the tale  but if you can accept it for what it is  theres entertainment to be had  
holes  lets see  a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up  
for a year veteran that can command the big bucks  the jackal is an incredibly poor shot  
the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police  but its just the two of them  
willis disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmers in  the saint   
  and lest you misunderstand  thats not a compliment   
but the three stars are fun to watch  
its good to see gere in something other than a business suit  
willis has a mixed history in picking projects  but his characters are always watchable  
poitier is by far the superior actor  but has limited screen time  
the problems in logic are flaws  but dont ruin the experience  
occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes  
this is one of them
