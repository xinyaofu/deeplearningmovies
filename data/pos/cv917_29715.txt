but whats this     
the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers     
you bet  
buckle up  dorothy    this is gonna be one bumpy ride  
critique  a good ol time at the movies  
heres a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesnt really bring anything  new  to the forefront  if youve seen flicks like duel and breakdown  youve crossed this path before   but still manages to entertain you gangbusters  with realistic situations  believable characters  funny moments  thrills  chills  the whole shebang  
lets give it up for director john dahl  who continues to put out solid films every other year  if you havent seen red rock west  do yourself a favor right now  and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience   
and much like that film  this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace  
it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters  and then shows you how one small prank  can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone  
paul walker really surprised me in this movie  since ive never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face  and damn  is it ever pretty or what    
but here  he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and thats always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters  
sobieski is also good  but she isnt in the movie for as long as youd think  but the man who really takes this film to another level  is steve zahn  
if youve loved this guy as the  goofball  in most of his previous roles  youll appreciate him even more here  as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings ive seen in quite some time   this is so awesome      
only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick  
and speaking of the ending  boy  does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final  clicks or what    
the arrow and i were practically in each others arms  well  maybe im exaggerating  but you catch my drift  as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn  took it all to an even higher level  
once again  kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity  suspense and tension  with a great score  editing  style and camerawork  
plotwise  i too did wonder how the  bad guy  was able to track them so well  but it didnt really bother me all that much  you can assume that he had bugged their car    
but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldnt help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance  
a great movie with an even cooler ending  this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year  
  this is amazing     
wheres joblo coming from  
american psycho     deep blue sea     eye of the beholder     the fast and the furious     final destination     the glass house     no way out
