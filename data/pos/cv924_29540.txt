the most amazing thing about paul coxs innocence is how unlike a movie it is  
i mean that as the highest compliment  
if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a yearold romance  id want to run and hide  
the sex scenes would be handled as a farce  producers would shed  years off the characters ages  so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star  and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence  
along with a charming romantic story  the australianbelgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable  
the romance gets started when former musician andreas  charles  bud  tingwell   learns that his true love  claire  julia blake   lives nearby  
they decide to catch up on old times  but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair  
complicating matters is andreas frail health  and claires longtime husband  terry norris   who cant understand why hes suddenly become obsolete  
in my mind  the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire  than the feelings of everyone involved  
john  claires husband  endlessly questions what he did wrong  
claire initially insists shes a grownup  but admittedly behaves like a child  a prospect that thrills and disappoints her  
andreas  an agnostic  begins to question his fate  a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence  
cox litters the movie with flashbacks  including the repeated vision of a roaring train  
its a reminder of andreas and claires past love  as young lovers  they met by train   but as it recurs  we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed  
a pall is cast on the whole affair  
a master of the understated  cox strings together a series of memorable moments  
in andreas dream sequence  amidst the roar of the train and conversations  we get the whole picture of andreas and claires love  
we also get glimpses into john and claires relationship  
during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward  claire admits to john about her indiscretion  telling more than any monologue could  
all thats heard is the scraping of forks against plates  
the characters are unlike anything ive seen  theyre people  
so many times  movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky  
or theyre reduced to comedic buffoons  
ordinary people with a pile of emotions  claire and andreas arent sure what the next step is  
they do want to be happy  which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what theyve known throughout their adult lives  
bravo to cox  who wrote the script  for not making john a monster  so that claires affair is automatically justified  
norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claires love difficult to accept  
we feel for him  
hes a decent man  
sure  he may have become complacent  but he never expected this  especially now  
with so much presented to the audience  its only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive  which it does  
however  in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers  cox displays a skill and  lan isnt likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon
