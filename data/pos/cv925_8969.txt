contact is a film that tries to do several different things  
it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like  to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life  to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation  and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr  ellie arroway  jodie foster  and the religious spokesman palmer joss  matthew mcconaughey   
the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals  
the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable  albeit less immediately engaging  than  say  the coldblooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tvs the xfiles  
the aliens in contact seem to be like usthey are more curious than anything else  
they know we exist  they want us to know that they exist  and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person  
the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly  and between the characters ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world  that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubricks   a space odyssey  
most of the film  however  takes place on earth  where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens  
scientists are enthusiastic  ultraconservative religious leaders are wary  and government officials are caught somewhere in between  
the debate is fueled largely by dr  arroways atheism  she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints  but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankinds representative to another species  
the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions  especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches  science and faith  could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed  
still  the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society  
the two  sides  are represented primarily by arroway and by farright fundamentalists  but in reality probably  of americans are neither atheists nor farright fundamentalists  
palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground  but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a lessthanideal spokesman for any ideology  
then again  the film does concentrate mostly on public debate  which does  after all  tend to be dominated by extremists  rather than on dinnertable or collegedormitory discussions  
contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues  then  but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself  
the films one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss  
for one thing  it resorts to the tired movie clich  that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together  as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction  
the romance rarely  if ever  sheds any light on the characters  although it occasionally tries and fails  josss explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement   i guess you could say im a man of the cloth  but without the cloth    for example  is more like a punchline to a joke than character development  
instead  the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments  
granted  this is a plot and ideadriven film and the characters are secondary  but this just seemed like laziness on the writers part more than anything else  
the successes of contact  however  far outweigh its failures  
even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether  which it didnt   the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film  
contact doesnt quite cover all the bases  but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a twohour film  and its rejection of bigbudget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable  
and i would not be surprised if  ten years from now  contact is mentioned in the same breath as  and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction
