this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated  
there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywoods most famous celebrities  some fabulous animation and a compelling story  
this is the best weve seen from disney since  beauty and the beast      
this film begins an unspecified time following the happilyeverafter conclusion to toy story  
in the aftermath of their earlier adventures  buzz  voice of tim allen  and woody  voice of tom hanks  are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony  content with their  lives   
one day  andy broke woodys arm off  while playing with him  
woody is now officially discarged and worthless  left with his nightmares  where he lies in a trash can with the other discards  
later andys mother decides to have a yard sale  and she collects a few old toys from her sons room  
since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang  woody goes to the rescue  leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back  
although his mission is successful  he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al  voice of wayne knight  spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale  
the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series   woodys roundup   
if he can acquire woody  al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit  
so  after andys mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy  al steals him  and its up to the other toys  led by buzz  to go into the city to save their friend  
and so  buzz  rex  voice of wallace shawn   hamm  voice of john ratzenberger   mr  potatohead  voice of don rickles   and slinky  voice of jim varney   go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend  they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys  
there are car chases  gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis  who  by the way  resembles darth vader   
meanwhile  woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family  a cowgirl named jessie  voice of joan cusack   a horse named bullseye  and a father figure called the prospector  voice of kelsey grammar   
they offer him another life  as a celebrity  a toy in a museum in japan  
he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while  before he grows up  and be forgotten  or be admired by children for generations  
the problem is  if woody escapes from als clutches and returns home  they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage  
a real effort is made in the technical department  
the animation is rich and colorful  with lots of wonderful details  the  cinematography  is also extremely improved since toy story  there are a lot of complicated swings  turns and closeups that really make an impression  
lighting and filters are used to create a mood  as in a surprisingly emotional moment  jessies remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy  the film contains a lot of inside jokes  such as the one about videogames   and entertaining parodies on  jurassic park  and  star wars   
the film ends with the  failed takes   the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv  
these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film  
but what in the end makes  toy story   a memorable experience is not the jokes  its multiple parodies or marvelous animation  
it is its heart and emotions  the story about the meaning of friendship  love and even life itself  
it is not difficult to predict that  toy story   would be a huge economical success  but its artistic achievement was unexpected  
unexpected because the first film wasnt much more than a demonstration of special effects  
but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasnt produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs  
but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film  making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that  years  
this is a big stepaway from the ancient laws of disneyanimation  
off course  this is not  antz   it is not as intelligent  this is not a landmark and no masterpiece  but i promise that youll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have  
whether this is the best animated film of the year  i dare not say  
my choice would probably be  the iron giant   but  along side with  american pie   this is the comedy of the year  
i almost lost my hopes for disney  but  toy story   proves that disney hasnt lost their ability to entertain
