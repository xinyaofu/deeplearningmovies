when i initially set out to review this film  my tag line was going to be  you too can believe whales can fly   
then it was going to be  you too can believe pastel triangles can fly   
then  it was going to be  you too can believe wood sprites can fly   
finally  i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    
theres a lot of flying going on in this film  
as our first host steve martin tells us  the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while  because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in   grossing somewhere close to    in its original month of release   
subsequent rereleases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved  and rightfully deserved   
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia  disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before  six stories high  
in an exclusive four month engagement  from january st to april th     fantasia  can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  
after the engagement is over  the film will be shown at regular theaters  
is the format effective for the film  
with a few exceptions  yes  
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethovens fifth symphony  
its hard to describe exactly what this segment is about  but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil  black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  
eventually  shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns to the butterfly things  
though this segment isnt very story driven  some of the images are very visually strong  especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things  who are all outlined in blood red colors  begin to overtake the skies  
the next segment is set to ottorino respighis  the pines of rome   
in this segment  some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  
he is finally saved  by another liberating shaft of light  and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the  oceans  of clouds  
again  visuals are the key with this segment  especially where the whales are involved  
reportedly the whales  as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences  are shown as actual size  
the cgi whales look incredibly lifelike  except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  
absolutely beautiful stuff  
the third segment  and the least of the eight segments  is set to george gershwins  rhapsody in blue   
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld  and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york  
theres a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer  an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having a job  a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm  and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife  
i wont go into how everything works out  but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending  
unfortunately  the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments  
segment four is set to dmitri shostakovichs  piano concerto no    and is an animated version of hans christian andersens  the steadfast tin soldier   
a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a windup clock ballerina  whom he assumes is also one legged because he cant see her other leg extended out behind her   much to the dismay of an evil jackinthebox jester  
the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina  
little does the jester know  the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from  
the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl  
although the ending has been altered from the andersen story   the steadfast tin soldier  is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short  
some children may find the jester to be a little frightening  but otherwise the segment is well made  
segment five is the funniest of the bunch  
set to camille saintsaens  the carnival of the animals   this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yoyo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number  
while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia  it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy  
segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original  fantasia  and its the one that people remember most   the sorcerers apprentice   
the story is the most recognizable  so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo  
unfortunately  the segment wasnt made to be presented on large format film  considering it was shot full frame  and exhibits large amounts of grain  
there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain  
similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately  but no one seems to notice for some strange reason   an anomaly common to many plus screen theaters  
segment seven is set to sir edward elgars  pomp and circumstance march no    and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character  
donald duck  stars  as an assistant to noah  whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark  
during the loading  donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didnt make it on the boat  
they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners  
despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece  it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tearjerkers foisted on audiences these days  
powerful stuff  
segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich   saving the best for last   
set to igor stravinskys  the firebird   an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape  
trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation  
when the sprite examines the formation  it awakens and becomes the titular firebird  
in a stunning spectacle  the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path  including everything that the sprite has worked to create  
some amazing animation is present here  and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone  although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film   
the host segments are largely  no pun intended  throwaways  although steve martins clip is pretty funny  
be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin  
penn and teller are usually funny  but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting  
the best segment comes from  of all people  bette midler  who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board  
pieces like flight of the bumblebee  a take on the four horsemen set to wagners  ride of the valkyries   and a strange segment prepared in the s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments  
for fans of visual stimulation or classical music  fantasia  is a perfect way to spend the afternoon  
the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material  
as i mentioned earlier in the review  if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film  fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters  
i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though  
then you too can believe that whalestriangle thingssprites can fly
