its tough to really say something nice about a type of person whos so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone  but by god   american history x  does it  and for that  i commend it  
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neonazi skinhead  a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone whos not what they are  and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  
the subject of this film is one of them  but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  
hes the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage  and then in another brilliant stroke  justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  
hes so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  
his name is derek vinyard  and hes played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks hes almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as  say  malcom x  when we first see him  hes clean shaven  with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast  a devlish goatee  and hes attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets  at least when he doesnt need them  
he so believes in his convictions that hes willing to put his beliefs to the test  even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison  if only for a couple years  
  american history x  is about derek  how he became a neonazi skinhead  how he rose to power  how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself  and how he tried to save others  namely his younger brother  from making the same mistake  
we see him at all of these stages  as a smart teenager  a vicious hate monger  a man having an epiphany  and the man who tries to correct what hes done before  and in all of these  we get a portrait of a man from all sides  
or at least  thats the intention  
the films framing device is his brother  danny  edward furlong  perpetually looking about    also now a skinhead  and how his principal  bob sweeney  avery brooks  who i just found out was or is the captain on star treks deep space    is trying to  correct  him  
when the film opens  danny has just written a book report on  mein kampf   landing him in trouble with sweeney  which causes him to make him write a paper on dereks life and how it has gotten him nowhere  
coincidentally  this day is the day derek is released from prison  and when we see him  hes cleanedup  not as buff  and has a full head of hair  
hes just as intelligent  but still very rough along the edges  but hes wisened up  
hes no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews  and tries to persuade danny  whos becoming what derek was before  to give up his lifestyle  
but danny wont  
he goes to a large skinhead beer bash  meets with the skinhead leader  stacy keach   and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neonazidom as he was for it a couple of years ago  
the film circles around this  then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks  all done in black and white  
we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead  living in venice beach  organizing vicious and quasisadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white  middleclass teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work  and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on  
to them  the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop  and he not only speaks elloquently  forcefully  and intelligently  but he backs everything up with political reasons  justifying their rage at least to them  
and frighteningly enough  much of what he says sounds true  
  american history x  is a collection of really great scenes and moments  rather than a cohesive  great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next  
in it  there are some of the best scenes ive seen all year  
one scene features a dinner between dereks family  and his mothers newest boyfriend  played with reserve by eliott gould   a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with dereks rightist views  launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience  goulds reaction to dereks final summation is unnerrving   
another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black coworker  guy torry  while folding laundry in prison  
and another soontobeclassic is actually divided in two  the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail  which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year  
theres much more to appreciate  like the acting  which is uniformly good  with standouts coming from avery brooks  beverly dangelo  as the longsuffering mother   and gould  who has one horrible line  but other than that  comes off with the best performance hes given in what seems like a really long time   
norton walks off with the film  though  coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble  
in only the fifth movie of his career  norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation  and maybe the best  
theres nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie  spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience  coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando  
that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing  
sadly enough  this isnt going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be  
its too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece  
the ending  especially  is pencilled in from other movies  tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon  
some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches  kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the  fat skinhead   whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more   and even the dramatic arc isnt as well travelled  
furlongs danny never seems to really be learning a lesson  since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view  and when he decides to make a change by the end  which was inevitable   it doesnt seem like it has actually arrived there  
even dereks descent into skinheaddom doesnt seem justified  
though his fireman father  william russ  the dad from  boy meets world   and dont ask me how i know that  is killed by a black junkie  and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently  there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs  
as such  one can see why the director  tony kaye  wanted to have his name removed  
sorta  
  american history x  is a very good movie  and i was very moved by it  but it could be a lot better  and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential  
somewhere  he claims  there lies a tony kaye cut  and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton  who then ordered another cut  and that is thus  
although he aimed for the directing credit to go to  alan smithee   the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director  it wasnt allowed to him  under the grounds that once you disown a film  you can not badmouth it  but really  thats the macguffin  no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval   
kayes right in that its not up to par  even if hes not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par  
this will not be a  do the right thing  for the late s  
yet it still gets its point across intelligently  and backs it up with its story  its message  that one cannot be so enwrapped in ones own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur  is literally said over the narration  unfortunately   
and even if it isnt perfect  at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison  and asks him if anything hes done has made his life any better  it realy hits a nerve  not only in derek  but also in the audience
