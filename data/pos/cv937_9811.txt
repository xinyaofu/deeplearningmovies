synopsis  as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces  a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case  
if she can survive the demanding s  e  a  l  
training  she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps  
throw in a lot of political machinations  sabotage  brutality  water and sand and you have an entertaining movie  
review  the title of this movie turned me off at first  
i mean gi jane        
the other titles which were considered were more promising  in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as im concerned  
i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor  
to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie  
moore as lieutenant jordan oneil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men  
the storyline is simple  
anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless  machiavellian politician with an agenda to push  
using feminism to achieve political mileage  she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s  e  a  l  
training  
jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all  looks  brains and strength  
the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch  
nonetheless  its one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless heroheroine along in hisher endeavours  
sure  there are the stereotypical elements  inhuman treatment  sexual innuendo  resentful peers  pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer  
stepping away from the stereotypes though  viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer  
his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character  
jordans boyfriend royce is also in the military  
although they both started at the same time  due to the fact that he has seen active service  he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has  
royce  what is his surname  
do we care   
almost resents jordans attempts to advance herself  although he quickly settles down to being doeeyed and supportive  
his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you dont have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military  
in parts  this is a very silly movie  with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that its hard not to cringe  
i still liked it though  
weaknesses in the script aside  this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood  
as we watch jordans battle  its increasingly clear that it is a personal battle  
this is an individuals fight for selfadvancement  
we dont have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings  we dont have to feel uncomfortable because were having ideology thrust down our throats  
its enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not
