scream   like its predecessor  is a genrecrossing film  
it is about  horror film and  murder mystery  
the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time  
scream was also known for its selfreferential tone  
many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven  
again  scream  follows suit with characters saying such things as  sequels suck  and  the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels   
scream s story is very similar to its predecessors  
sidney  neve campbell   having survived the killing spree in scream  is now in college  
gale weathers  courteney cox  has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film  called stab  which for all practical purposes is the realworld movie scream   
at the premiere of stab  two students from sidneys college are stabbed to death  and a new story begins  
the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer  
they want to know all about the links between stab  sidney  and the recent murders  
the most complex selfreference i saw  this should be an olympic event  was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference  
the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers  
the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press  
the audience was watching the whole  filmed scene  
  whew   
the movie is packed with layers and selfreferences that make it a pleasure to watch  
even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream   thats not to say that these references necessarily make scream  a deep  or even a good movie  
the just add to the fun of watching it  
i recommend it for other reasons as well  
what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural  
no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible  
it is a person in a mask and a robe  his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims  
no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer  
the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies  you have less grounds to say  its just a movie   
the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself  gale weathers and deputy dewey  david arquette  also from the original  track down a killer  
they are likeable  but not outstanding  
but in combination with the horror aspect  the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint  
it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream  
the internet movie database says that scream  is in the works  so i wonder if ill be doing the same thing on january     
if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high  ill be happy to mark my calendar
