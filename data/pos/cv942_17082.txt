it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a lessthansavoury character as mel gibson does in payback  
of course  if i was being paid  million for one months work  id probably be willing to take risks as well  but thats neither here nor there  
payback is based on a novel by richard stark  apparently actually donald e  westlake  author of the grifters  itself a fine crime film  which was also filmed in the s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys  lee marvin  
the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back  by whom we dont know yet  
all we know is that gibson  as porter  isnt a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back  and getting even in the process  no matter what the consequences  
it turns out that the man hes after is val  gregg henry   his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters  
obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul  val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers  
porter  however  is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet  goes about exacting revenge on the doublecrossing val  
gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play  that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesnt mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants  
you probably wouldnt see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat  outofcharacter role such as porter  jim carrey wont be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried  the cable guy  anyone    
harrison fords idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent  the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin  which we wont mention further  and has stallone ever really played a villain at all  
this is not to say that porter is a villain  per se  
while he isnt the sort of character you wouldnt want to get on the wrong side of  hes nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their righthand men just to prove how mean they are  
porter is only trying to get back what is notsorightfully his  which in a way is almost understandable  
payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedythriller which wont be remembered as being among gibsons most important work  but is still one of the finer films hes done  
the only real problem with it is that  while everything seems to work out in the end  i was left feeling something was lacking  was that all  
the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute  and the final voiceover doesnt ring true  even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the filmnoir style the rest of the film embodies  
the film just ends far too suddenly  after a huge buildup in the penultimate scenes  
a fine film  even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation  
just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending
