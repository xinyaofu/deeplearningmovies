how many of us would become strippers  
for those of us who wouldnt  is it a moral reason  or purely a lack of confidence  
thats probably not a fair question  and for a lot of us  it could very well be for neither of those reasons  
as you watch the full monty  however  you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions  
would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough  
in case you havent guessed  the full monty is about stripping  but striptease it aint  
its actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication  
it is the story of six outofwork  outofshape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless  but not without need  
what to do  
it hits our main character gaz  robert carlyle  as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis  
it seems that simple  take it off and bring in the cash  
eventually  gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance  
these include the overweight  confidencelacking dave  mark addy   the uptight  overlyofficious gerald  tom wilkinson   the once suicidal lomper  steve huison   and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition  horse  paul barber   an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy  and guy  hugo speer   a young wellendowed looker who compares himself to cary grant  
when the sextet is complete  were given a hefty dose of physical comedy  
we watch the bumbling middleaged men choreograph pseudosexy dance numbers  all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place  
as if there antiappeal wasnt enough  they decide to boost interest in the group by promising  the full monty  on opening night  which for us americans  means baring it all  
  
  
and i mean  all   
the movie actually ends on opening night  a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add  
its sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater  
with the subject matter  you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feelgood  almost inspiring film  but it surprisingly turns out that way  
the amount of light  touching drama also comes as a nice surprise  never feeling offbalance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film  
theres a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words  and the ensemble cast couldnt be better  
each character is completely individual  interesting  funny  and most importantly  real  
the full monty is never offensive  a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone couldve easily fallen prey to tastelessness  
its one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment  perfect for a great night on the town  or as a saturday night movie rental  
either way you see it  it shouldnt let you down in the slightest  
and  pun heavily intended  when its all said and done  youll be smiling from cheek to cheek
