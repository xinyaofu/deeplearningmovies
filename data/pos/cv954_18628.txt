eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career  
known for his notorious late s slump  murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years  
with the exception of the dreadful holy man  he appears to be on pace for a fullfledged comeback  
life was a great move on the part of murphy and costar martin lawrence  because its a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slapsticky drivel  
director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own  and doesnt insert a distracting plot to back them up  
life is  in a sense  one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other  
amazingly  the scale never tips in eithers favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other  
as the movie opens  were introduced to ray gibson  eddie murphy   a twotiming pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club  
there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks  martin lawrence   
somehow  after multiple contrivances  the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run  
when all is said and done  ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff  
hence the setting of life  mississippi state prison  where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important  and become set on finding an foolproof escape plan  
the film takes us from the s all the way to the s  presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude  
luckily  rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic  academy award caliber manner  
not only do we believe the characters look as if theyre  years old  but they sound like it  too  
murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles  even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards  
this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up its sleeve  
while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy  there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at its core  
but the comedic aspects work wonderfully  wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars  
the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama  but in both senses  its an overwhelming delight  
i could say a few bad things about the movie  but i dont want to  
its such a nice surprise  such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence  that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll
