cinematically speaking  gordon parks original  shaft is not a great film  
a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action  this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidymans  black private dick thats a sex machine to all the chicks  to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking  
yet nearly  years after its original releaseand long after the genre it spawned   blaxploitation   died with that decadethe  shaft remains an extremely entertaining watch  never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness  
the reason for this is the same one that explains the films connection with moviegoers far beyond the target africanamerican audience  the title character of john shaft  
while the fact that the strong  smart  virile  and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance  his broadbased appeal stems from an idea that transcends race  he is comfortable  confident  and proud about who he is  and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass  
this fact also explains why john singletons yg revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is  
much like the film that started the franchise  this shafts plot doesnt score points in the originality department  but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers  
contrary to what has been reported over the past few months  this shaft is not a remake of the original film  but more of a sequelspinoff  
the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels  s shaftsbigscore   and s shaftinafrica   richard roundtree  once again plays john shaft  who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city  
however  the focus of the film lies on his samenamed nephew  samuel l  jackson   who  as the film begins  is a cop whose takenocrap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors  
when a privileged young man named walter wade jr   christian bale  accused of a brutal  raciallymotivated murder is allowed to be released on bail  a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p  i  
but thats easier said than done  for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez  jeffrey wright   a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri  toni collette   the only eyewitness to his crime  
peoplesor  rather  wright is also the big obstacle in jacksons way toward commanding this film  
peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time  and wright is insanely funny during these stages  
however  he isnt so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish  and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable  which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo  who bowed out before filming   
its no easy task to steal a film from the jackson  who is his usual captivating  charismatic self here   but thats exactly what wright doesand makes it seem effortless  
then again  with such a talented ensemble surrounding him  it is not too surprising that jacksons impressive star turn doesnt quite tower over the rest  he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other costars  
bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in americanpsycho  so it only follows that his performance as a similar  less exaggerated character would be spoton  
collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened  conflicted diane  
busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shafts sidekick rasaan  
registering not as stronglybut through no fault of their ownare vanessa williams  as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez  and a dismayingly underused roundtree  they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price  singleton  and shane salerno  
  jackson also has little to  do  in a sense  some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside  his shaft doesnt even have one sex scene   
that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since hes not really an action director  
this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases  
they move well  as does the film as a whole  and are reasonably exciting  its just that theres nothing terribly inventive about them  
these set pieces are functional in the way the script is  they work well enough  but theyre unsurprising and conventional  
but if theres anything that a shaft movie does well  its make the familiar look cooland this shaft keeps that tradition alive  
from the slick title sequencescored  of course  to isaac hayes everinfectious oscarwinning theme song  which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the filmon  the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado  
even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced  it feels necessary  
style doesnt exactly make for a great film  but when it comes to shaft  thats of little consequence  
what matters above all else is having a good time  and the latest shaft should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad muthashut your mouth
