capsule  the best place to start if youre a jackie chan newcomer  
roars along  never stops for breath  and frequently hilarious  
to talk about jackie chan as a  stuntman  is to miss a million things  
jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today  but also a very funny guy  
he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger  used  to make me laugh  hes funny just standing there  copping a look  
supercop has jackie making us laugh  scream  duck  root  and gasp for breath  often all in the same scene  
its actually the third in a loosely related series of movies  each with jackie playing kevin chan  a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neckdeep into trouble and then karatekicking his way out of it  
  the others are also worth seeing   
its a little slow to start  but once it gets moving  its a field day  
the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind  
kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china  which requires him to collaborate with the attractive  and asskicking  chief fo chinese security  played here by the everenjoyable michelle yeoh   
theres a fun chemistry between the two of them  especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform  
kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail  all undercover  of course  and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss  
the drug boss  however  has problems of his own  his wifes on trial for many of his own crimes  and shes got the key to an account with all of his drug funds  
this means  of course  endless trouble  not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while hes out in the field  and she sees him with this other woman  and    but thats one of the movies unique pleasures  the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly  
action  there is  of course  nonstop action in this movie  everything from oneonone kung fu to allout gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines    
outrunning the hong kong coast guard  
there is also a virtuoso climax  which features  among other things  jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter  a wrongway freeway chase  which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt   a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the copter as well as a motorcycle  
you get the idea  
this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food  quick  enjoyable  filling  
watch it with friends  
when they stop making movies like this  the world will be a tad greyer
