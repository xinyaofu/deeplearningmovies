the calendar year has not even reached its midway point  but that hasnt prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscarbait season  
bille augusts highprofile adaptation of victor hugos classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epichandsome production values  strong performances by a topnotch cast  a literate screenplaywith one critically missing element  emotional sweep  
for those not familiar with hugos original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired  the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a thcentury frenchset version of the fugitive  
after serving  years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread  the brutish jean valjean  liam neeson  is paroled  
immediately upon release  he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night  he is caught by authorities  only to be forgiven by the bishop  who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow  
that he does  and in doing so breaks his parole  which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert  geoffrey rush   who was one of the guards in valjeans prison camp  on his trail  
thematically  however  les miserables is a story about redemption  which valjean finds through his dealings with two women  the hardluck factoryworkerturnedprostitute fantine  uma thurman   and her illegitimate daughter  cosette  
years after breaking parole  valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau  where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert  
valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette  mimi newman  from her cruel caretakers  the thenardiers  and raise the child as his own  
the  father  and  daughter  eventually land in paris  where the teenage cosette  claire danes  falls for dashing student revolutionary marius  hans matheson   
the decadesspanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of  and the danish august turns in his most accomplished englishlanguage work  following the underrated  superstar soap the house of the spirits and last years stylish but highly preposterous mystery smillas sense of snow  
he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace  
production designer anna asp  costume designer gabriella pescucci  and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast  
neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable  rushs finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated  oscarwinning theatrics in shine  and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role  
the younger members of the cast fare less well  
danes is convincing as cosette  but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction  and matheson  while competent  is a less interesting robert sean leonard  
as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is  by the time les miserables was over  my emotions had only been superficially involved  
while i was touched by valjeans relationships with fantine and cosette  i was not moved  
not even reaching the  touching  level is the cosettemarius pairing  
my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical  as i am sure many others is   and i was dismayed to see eponine  a friend of mariuss who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him  almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation  the daughter of the thenardiers  here she is only briefly seen as a child   
her presence would have added some muchneeded conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance  but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine  fantine  was enough  
even so  as  creeps into summer blockbuster season  les miserables is a thoughtful  wellmade  entertaining film  one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn nobrainers invade the multiplex
