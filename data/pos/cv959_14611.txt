an entertaining  hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early s  
sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte  who are on the lookout for love  
alice is mousy  shy  intellectual  charlotte is bitchy  outgoing and fun  
we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures  and men  all to the background of the local disco  
whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story  
alice and charlotte are both well written characters  and the actresses who play them arent bad aswell  
sevigny delivers an honest performance  and makes the audience feel for her character  
beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified  yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable  
the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining  
the dialogue is sharp and well written  with many funny set pieces  
for example  theres a great discussion about lady  the tramp by the main characters  
the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun  
the direction is good  bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes  
but their are slight flaws with the movie  
firstly  although it is supposedly set in the s  the characters are very  very s  
the way they dress and act have a very s feel to them  
although the male hairstyles look slightly s  frankly the s atmosphere just wasnt conveyed  which is a shame  
also  as mentioned above  the film is too long  and some parts do lag  
the charm of the characters do help these moments  but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter  
the plot also sidetracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust  which seemed out of place in this movie  
finally  their are almost too many characters in the film  and despite the running time  the film never really spends enough time on them  
some of the characters are very slight  which is a shame  
the conclusion  while funny  is also surprisingly weak  and certainly not strong enough  
but despite these qualms  the last days of disco is a funny  warm movie  which is certainly worth seeing  and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the s  
worth a look  
overall rating
