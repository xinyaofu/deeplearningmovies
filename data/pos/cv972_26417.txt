for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend  there are certain rules that he needs to follow  
firstly  fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship  
secondly  buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes  
thirdly  find the perfect moment and location to propose  
finally  the groomwannabe should probably get her parents blessing  
of these four  the last one can be a nightmare  
meeting parents is a rite of passage  fraught with unexpected questions  bouts of nervousness  the reality of being disliked  and the inability to make a positive impression  
if youre lucky  things will go smoothly  
but  if youre greg focker  ben stiller   everything will go wrong  
and with a name like that  how could it not  
when greg first meets his fianc  es father  jack byrnes  the grimacing robert deniro   greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive  
when he tells jack that hes a male nurse  the incorrigible dad shoots back   not many men in your profession  huh  greg   
its definitely not a good start  
but greg is determined to win him over  and its this desire that fuels the movie  
he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner  
it doesnt matter that hes jewish  
if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace  then thats what hes going to gamely do  
  oh god    youre 
such a good god   he moons  
his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle  but when jack gives him the  deniro squint   that familiar  unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility   its pretty hard not to grin  
things get progressively worse for greg  
and thats too bad because hes a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart  
eventually  he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up  committing a host of gaffes that embarrass  humiliate or injure other people  
its a neverending ordeal of missteps  miscues  and mistakes  
he buys some champagne  but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances  
he tries to find jacks missing cat  
but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble  
and there are several other episodes  each one trumping the next in outrageousness  
the more our wellmeaning beau screwed up  the more the audience groaned in sympathy  
we liked greg  
and  we liked this movie  
  meet the parents  is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments  
just sit back and watch greg get into trouble  
no matter what the situation  whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house  things will horribly go wrong  
we laugh at gregs expense  but love often makes a person do dumb things  and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool  
deniro is also affable  tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside  
their tugofwar is often funny  the slapstick is elaborate  and there are several topical throwaway gags  mostly targeted at the airline industry  to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future inlaws from hell
