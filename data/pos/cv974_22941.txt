  note  there are spoilers regarding the films climax  the election  of course  
we see matthew broderick  a man torn to a primal state  hes been unfaithful to his wife  lied to and manipulated his students  and by the same token theyve demeaned his masculinity  his selfrespect  his desperate attempt at changing the world  
and yet  he equates the cause of his pain  his torment  with tracy flick  reese witherspoon   
no matter how many students have come and gone  and disappointed him as an educator  shes the real threat  
about to give in  and divulge that shes won by only a lone vote  brodericks mccalister turns in defeat  sees tracys euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says  no  
the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men  no matter how obscure  have in their relationships  a traditional expectation of success  to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry  
she cant go higher than him  
he wont allow it  
and whats amazing about  election  is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor  
early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically  and then sexually  involved with a now departed teacher  
its like payne and taylor  his coscreenwriter  have taken tracy  a girl desperate for friendship  loyalty  and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers  that they found sitting at the teachers lunch table more fitting  to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist  
and its amazing the compassion that we have  it seems so real to us  and not merely because its happened before  splashed all over the front pages  but  because of the all around  nice  persona of these people  we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters  
its with mandy barnetts  if youll be the teacher  playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most  a final  viscous injection of bittersweet irony  
sexuality  though  is not the only basis for paynes satire  or its success  
it also makes a telling point about politics  friendship  and class boundaries  
satire is required  or ought to be  anyway  to take itself seriously  or act so  while the audience does not  
its a fine line to straddle  but some films ignore it altogether   drop dead gorgeous  leaps infuriatingly to mind   
payne and taylor hit the right chord  their characters are real people  neither is perfect  but rather both of the leads are flawed  misguided individuals who retain  somewhat  noble intentions at heart  
we sympathize with them  but still  as a satire  their idiosyncratic behavior  and their wrongdoing  is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle  but also reflect and meditate  about  
minus half a point  though  for payne admitting not to having seen  ferris buellers day off   
whatever
