lets say you live at the end of an airport runway  
large jetliners continuously pass over your house  rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace  
lets say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances  and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home  
now lets say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway  and offers you more than its worth  
wouldnt you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed  
of course you would  
but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise  and the house your castle  
thats what they are to darryl kerrigan  michael caton   and although hes happy that a multinational corporation would like to buy his home  sorry  its not for sale  
unfortunately  the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government  which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice  
not about to take this lying down  darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto  tiriel mora  and makes a determined  albeit pathetic  attempt to fight back  
the castle  an australian comedy by rob sitch  is perhaps one of the simplest movies ive seen in recent memory  yet also one of the funniest  
in fact  it is this films reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful  
the good guys and the bad guys are clear  the humor is straightforward  and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets  
its the perfect setup for a relaxing  hilarious good time  and as much as i hate to admit it  i liked the fact that i didnt have to think all that much while watching this film  
i just sat back and enjoyed myself  
the situation is one weve seen before  regular joe fights back against the government  or big business  or whatever  
what makes this film different is its characters  
darryl thinks hes got the best life in the world  he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind  he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when hes got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal  anne tenny   and he swells with pride when his son dale  stephen curry  digs a hole in the yard  
steve kerrigan  anthony simcoe  constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for  investments  like jousting sticks and overhead projectors  while wayne kerrigan is in jail  as a result of dennis denutos incompetent courtroom maneuvers  
the great thing about the kerrigans is that they arent so stupid that they get annoying  
theyre just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing  
we look upon them with a little bit of pity  but a whole lot of affection  
screenwriters sitch  santo cilauro  tom gleisner  and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate  further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans  
sympathy for their situation  the laughter they bring us  and the familys wonderful characterization  simple as it may be  leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them  
i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans  but trust me  it works  
i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs  
dont get me wrong  slapstick  when executed well  can be genius  
its just that too often  a film will resort to its use as a shortcut to amusing the audience  not always successfully  
instead  the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world  
when they are by themselves  the are funny  and when they are with normal people  they are hilarious  
one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though  
the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the films running time  
luckily  its a funny little detour that  while slightly distracting from the films main drive  is still quite enjoyable  
with all the levity abound in the castle  the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept  that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property  an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes  
im not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life  but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution  of australia  and certainly sounds impressive at any rate  
and  for that matter  its more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this
