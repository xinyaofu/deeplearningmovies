i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials  but there isnt  
george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant  special effectsbound flicks and he has done it again  
this is the first star wars film ive seen on the big screen  so  of course  the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video  
what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story  but its amazing visuals  
basically  the films plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets  
quigon  liam neeson  and his young apprentice obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  set out with the animated jarjar binks to fix the mess that may result in war  
when their ship breaks down and they are stranded  they find a young boy  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  and his slave mother  
quigon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing  
anakin participates in a heartpounding podrace  one of the highlights of the film  to get the equipment needed to fix quigons ship  
however  most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy  
meanwhile  queen amadala  natalie portman  is frustrated and at wits end  being na  ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders  
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training  the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb  
this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made  
in all the star wars films  human emotions that we  the audience  can identify with are usually nil  but the films are for pure enjoyment  not for uplifting purposes  
despite the fun of watching the movie  the phantom menace is not without flaws  
for starters  we have the illconceived  moronic character jarjar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience  
what a klutz  
george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as  say  yoda  rd  or cpo  but  alas  his efforts were in vain  
secondly  this may be good or bad  depending on your point of view   the movies atmosphere is so different from the familiar comicbook feel of the previous three star wars installments  
this is due  perhaps  to the utter complexity to this movies plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here  
the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions  
i cant say much about the acting  though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway  
however  there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and  at times  stale  
natalie portman has a great presence  but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic  unfeeling  enigma  
there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance  
jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk  
despite the inevitable faults  there is so much to enjoy about the movie  
the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesnt quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes  but they are amazing and edgeofyourseat fun in their own rite  
the film is a treasure to look at  
the visual effects are astonishing    of the time the aweinspiring  mouthopening  eyepopping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius  
not since s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one  
the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element  the previous star wars movies  kubricks   maybe even of fritz langs classic silent metropolis  
however  all the sets are so original  
the original star wars movies cant even match the grandeur of this films visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode  
the costumes are remarkable and have jeanpaul gaultier written all over them  
whether its queen amadalas gigantic wardrobe complete with goldembroidery and feathers  or the jedis simple brown uniforms  the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness  
the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie  
as for john williams score  i dont think hes done one as complex or powerful since  i cant even remember  
it is as epic as his schindlers list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws  
it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films  but williams has added on  made the music much more intense and moving  
what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie  one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed  
there is very little to hate in the film  its a very accomplished and skillfully made flick  
it is the best  fun  film and the best bigbudget film out today  most definitely
