lisa cholodenkos  high art   is an intelligent  quiet drama  
its strongest quality  aside from the topnotch central performances  is the perceptive way in which the film  also written by cholodenko  observes its characters  
they are all flawed people  some more troubled than others  but they are not judged  
judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers parts  because no one  no matter how bad off they are  deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of  
syd  radha mitchell   a yearold woman living with her longtime boyfriend james  gabriel mann   has recently been awarded an ideal job at the highprofile photography magazine   frame   
she very much enjoys where her career is headed  but is often not taken very seriously by her managers  who are always giving her petty jobs to do  when she knows she could be doing more important things  
one night  while taking a bath  syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers  so when she goes up there to inform them of it  she meets lucy beliner  ally sheedy   a thin  wornout  and unhappy woman  who lives with her drugaddicted german girlfriend  greta  patricia clarkson   a pathetic former actress who is usually so outofit that she often is in and out of conciousness  
syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy  and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before  
lucy claims she doesnt want to get back into the profession  but syd manages to convince the  frame  editors to do a piece on her work  
all the while  syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy  even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman  and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons  
  high art   is such an effective motion picture because it is never sugercoated or idealized  but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere  while syds luck begins to rise  
the film in no way is about lesbianism  but about love  which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality  
as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together  we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other  even if the relationship might be doomed  
with this picture  ally sheedys star has risen once again  thanks to her touching  nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy  a woman who  in the course of a decade  has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs  which has taken away her onceblossoming career  
her characted really is tragic  and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother  in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem  and her mother matteroffactly responds by saying she cant help her  is heartbreaking  
although not autobiographical  sheedy has had drug problems in her past  and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucys footsteps to her role  
also very good is radha mitchell as syd  who previously starred in the slight  australian comedy   love and other catastrophes   wh caught me by surprise with her performance  
easily being able to pass as christina riccis older sister  mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently  
as accurate as almost every detail is in   high art   i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james  who  played by gabriel mann  is left with a throwaway role  
by the time he finds out about syd and lucy  he disappears from the film  and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other  
this is a very minor fault  however  in a film that is full of riches  
although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair  syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems  
the character of dominique  anh duong   the  frame  editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas  was also written to be far more mature than expected  
and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done  
for once  it did not invlove steaminess  or violent sexual activity  or gratuitous nudity  but focused on the actual characters  who love each other  and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex  
  high art   which won the screenwriting award at the  sundance film festival  marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko  as well as sheedys strongest  and best  role to date
