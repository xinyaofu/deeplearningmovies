richard gere can be a commanding actor  but hes not always in great films  
everything comes together here  
gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity  
it doesnt go exactly as he expects  
geres client  aaron  edward norton   is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop  
the evidence is stacked against him  
he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishops blood  
his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene  
he has a relationship with the priest  
gere talks to the boy  believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer  
despite the lawyers proclamations that he doesnt care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with peoples lives  he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him  
lots of complications and twists  
the prosecuting attorney is geres former coworker and lover  
they both work each others motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy  
her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections  
aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on  
geres case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas  
gere is exceptional as the welldressed reserved counselor  but just once  i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his  suit  persona  
even when he loses it  you dont see very far inside  
nortons aaron is convincing  he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city  
the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story  
as with most of the effective courtroom dramas  the cinematography is crisp and rich  
the story will keep you on the edge of your seat  
nothing is what it seems
