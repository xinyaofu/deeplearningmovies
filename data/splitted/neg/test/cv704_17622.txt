after s  falling down   i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director  
since then he has offered us two soso adaptations of john grisham novels   the client  and  a time to kill   and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise  
although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumachers potential  the publicity for his latest release   mm   raised new hope  
it promised to be something unusual  
it wasnt  
the plot goes like this  tom welles  nicolas cage  is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman  allegorically named mrs  christian  myra carter   to investigate an mm movie found among her late husbands belongings  
the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask  who reminds me of bane in schumachers  batman  robin    
because murders can be realistically simulated in movies  mrs  christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead  
by combing through missing persons reports  tom finds the girls name and tracks her to los angeles  
with the aid of max california  joaquin phoenix   a video store clerk  and another symbolic name   tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff  
the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schraders  hardcore   in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter  
both films are modeled on dantes  the inferno   of course   mm  makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil  
  hardcore  is a much more subtle and meaningful film  
  mm  had a lot of promise  
in its better moments its an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom  
one moment of the first sort  when we first meet max hes reading truman capotes  in cold blood  underneath the cover of a porn novel  
  in cold blood  was the father of the truecrime genre  which is the literary equivalent of snuff films  
max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom   dance with the devil and the devil dont change  the devil changes you   
tom does changeill let you discover the specifics for yourselfbut not permanently  
schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didnt have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldnt come back  
  walkers  seven  did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise   
cage tries hard to pull it off  but the script doesnt give him enough to work with  
phoenix walks away with the moviehes smart  charming  and funny  
other cast members include  fargo  s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and  the sopranos  s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far  
in the last analysis  since  mm  falls short of its pretensions and its promise  its just another private eye story in the raymond chandlerross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege  
however  unlike other predictable fare in the genrelast years  twilight   for example  mm  is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is
