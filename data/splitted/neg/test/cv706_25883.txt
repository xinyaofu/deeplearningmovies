  nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy  
showgirls  nc   contains graphic nudity  profanity  sexual situations and violence  
some people  however  keep their clothes on  
you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values  nor do you write reviews on them  
thats why this review will be short  
it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores  
there is no story  script  point or acting  
only naked bodies  which is exactly the point  
here is the so called plot  nomi  the yearold with a dark past as a hooker  has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesnt wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big  fake smile  
no one is twisting nomis arm  
no one is holding her grandmother hostage  
she wants to do this  
and that is what she is doing till the end credits  
so whats the problem then  
whats the point  
whats the film about  
is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy  
this film can be described in one sentence  obscene level of incompetence  excessive stupidity in the story line  gross negligence of the viewers intelligence  a prurient interest in the quick buck  
believe me  after an hour with these characters  acting and script  youll start hoping for someone to kill somebody  
elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film  that is bad even for eszterhas script  
her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better  
her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry  selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public  
  i am not a whore  
i am a dancer   she screams  but does it in such an over dramatized way that youll start laughing  
in fact the acting in  showgirls  brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level  
not one single achievement  besides the conventional cinematography  is worth mentioning  
it is a total waste of time and money  
there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence  
the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another  
its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe  
  in my films   writes director paul verhoeven  basic instinct  total recall    i hold the mirror up to life   
well  excuse me  
his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas  and as he put it  show the naked truth   is simplified and unreal  
occasionally  between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities  screenwriter joe eszterhas  the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history  inserts some lines of deep morality  that sound something like this   hey  i see you  
i see that youre hiding    from what   
  from you   
yes  and even the only decent line in this film   nomi is what las vegas is all about  cant save showgirls from going under  
its a strange phenomena  
its not erotic  because it lacks sensuality  
not dramatic  because it lacks the acting  
and not intelligent because it lacks a story  
it is simply verhovens bad excuse for making pornography  
you want to see naked women  
bare breasts  
full frontals  
its nothing wrong with that  
but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store  and not waste time surviving through eszterhas pathetic dialogue  
b qualities  while its only a high budget pornfilm
