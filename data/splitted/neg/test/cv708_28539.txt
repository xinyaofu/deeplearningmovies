a bleak indie film about a stolen identity  
theres not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye  as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging  
it falls into the category of being a pretentious arthouse film  leaving a bitter taste in ones mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues  
it tries to make a heavyhanded point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment  with their only way out being crime  
but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell  that its hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean  
the relationship between the black mugger and his white victim is a cloudy one  which the film never determines what it wants to say about it  
matt mahurin is virtual oneman crew in putting this film together  directorwriter cinematographereditor   who is a still photographer in his day job  
the film works best as a visually challenging piece  as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding  
a white photographer  robert knepper  is mugged by a black gang while hes on a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at night  
he becomes a victim of amnesia and his head is bloodied as hes left in a deserted harlem building  as the gang leaves him for dead  but  one of the muggers  rumor  michael williams   comes back and pretends to help him  
hes a wouldbe photographer  who keeps a scrapbook entitled mugshots in the project apartment he shares with his mother and younger brother  
keeping his victim in the dark about who he is by calling him joe and not telling him whats happening  he becomes the photographer for a few days  
he enters the photographers stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera  and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend  stella  belinda becker   
shes the only one in the film who could act  
the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism  as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground  
it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks  as if its a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging
