synopsis  two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry  woody harrelson    an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post  tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye  has illtimed fits of coughing  and fails at everything he does  
the story is told from harrys point of view  
harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesnt drink  
one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea  elisabeth shue   who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesnt smoke  
seduced  harry agrees to participate in a moneymaking scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette  chloe sevigny   the teenage daughter of a rich man  
turns out  its all part of a needless  very puzzling  extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme  it involves hiring special impersonators  by two cons in order to fool harry  a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post  
when the kidnapped odette is found dead  the clues point to harry as the kidnappermurderer  and the police are hot on harrys trail  
harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money  
can he get out of this mess  
opinion  palmetto is a long  uninteresting film with all the wrong feel  
hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence  
this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof  
but palmetto is played like a dark  serious  detective noir drama  and watching harrys bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction  
theres a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts  buttocks  short skirts  colored painted nails  and womens legs  
even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema  you can always notice the side of elizabeth shues breast forming a prominent foreground  
towards the end  palmetto refocuses on plot for the grand finale   a confusing explanation involving impersonators  with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession  
if you can imagine shemp from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo lingerie suspense thriller  thats how out of synch this movie feels
