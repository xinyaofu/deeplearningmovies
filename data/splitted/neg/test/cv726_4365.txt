cashing in on the success of white men cant jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles  including the cowboy way and drop zone   wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed  hoping that they can strike up the same success  
sadly  if this dismal  cliche ridden and mindnumbingly boring action pic is anything to go by  they havent got a chance in hell of even coming close  
this time out  the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops  
following several runins with their tyrannical boss  robert blake   who is obsessed with the  money train  a train which carries all the subways takingsand will let nothing stop it  now  theres  an original plot device   harrelsons character decides to try and take off with the cash  
along the way  both of them fall in love with the same womananother transit cop who also hates her boss  
this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard  you were always the better brother etc  etc  etc    and doesnt help to add anything to the film  
given a better script  better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time  the film almost went for two hoursor did it just feel like it    this film might  and i mean  might   have turned out okay  but as it is  it is stocked with the worst action film cliches  whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time  
robert blake  who plays the evil boss  has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history  
he sounds like wayne newton  and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets  
but this is only one of money trains problems  
if you look at the script as if it was an action film  it lacks originality and suspense  
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film  it is even worse  
the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely aint butch and sundance  
the film isnt all bad though  
snipes and harrelson  when they arent using the dumb cliches that the script gives them  make an agreeable duo  and some of the stuntwork is indeed excellent  
but good stuntwork cannot save a bottomofthebarrel action movie  
if youre a really undemanding action freak  theres a chance youll like this  
but if youre looking for something original  or suspenseful  try somewhere elsei doubt youll find it here
