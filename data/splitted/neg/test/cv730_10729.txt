how do you judge a film that is so bad  but intentionally so  
in spiceworld  the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal  mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it  
if that was their goal  they did a fantastic job  
so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasnt really meant to be much better than this  
honestly  id rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades  so does that mean i graded it inaccurately  
truth be known  i dont really think i can answer this question  
to understand spiceworld  you have to understand the spice girls  
unless youre very  very  young  or fairly older  you probably have at least heard of them  
theyre a group of five busty british babes whove had  hit singles and whose debut album sold millions  
theyre primarily adored by preteen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spices  real name  geri haliwell  wonderbra  
all five of the girls have these  spicy  names for which they are better known than their real names  
there is the aforementioned ginger spice  as well as sporty spice  melanie chisholm  or mel c    scary spice  melanie brown  or mel b    baby spice  emma bunton   and posh spice  victoria addams   and all of them  to some degree or another  resemble their stage names  
the spice girls took the world by storm  and spiceworld is actually a good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame  
its quite nice to see what good sports the girls are  and not just the one dubbed sporty  about poking fun at themselves  
they dont take themselves too seriously  and thats probably the best thing about them  
its also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera  acting   and not just singing and dancing  
theyre not flawless by any means  but for the most part  they deliver their lines without feeling staged  and  like them or not  we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters  which seems reasonable since they portray themselves   
what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls wont get enough of their music  while the rest of us dont get enough of a movie  
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes  
most of the film is very blas   but several parts are downright boring  and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud  
if youre a big fan of the group  you probably wont get enough of what you want  and if youre not a big fan  you get too much time devoted to nothing more than  look at us  moments  
for the right crowd  the  music video  sequences will be the highlights of the film  but for others  they will serve as threeminute lulls in a hecticbutoveralluneventful storyline  
other key actors include richard e  grant as clifford  the spice girls manager  alan cumming as the filmmaker piers cuthertonsmyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group  george wendt as martin barnfield  a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie  and roger moore in a small  selfparodizing role  
all provide relatively good performances  keeping in mind once again that this film wasnt meant to be acted seriously  
even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it  
while this film is continuously compared to the beatles a hard days night  i think that is an unjust comparison  
it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits  but i dont think drector bob spiers  nor the spice girls  intended it to be so  
i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film  and have instead  come off rather pretentious  
i dont think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun  satirical look at a group that got so big  a movie seemed the next likely step  
and what couldve been better than a selfindulged yet self mocking approach  
probably nothing  and so it is  
spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy  but now instead  i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didnt even give a good review  
its bad  but it succeeds in every way it intended  
it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment  
perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick  
if thats the case  the movies gimmick is that it  is  such a gimmick  
you might be saying   a spice girls movie  
come on    but when it comes down to it  i think thats the point
