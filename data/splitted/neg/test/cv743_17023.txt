in  gia   angelina jolie plays the titular character  the first socalled supermodel  
and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome  in my eyes  anyway   
i just dont see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film  
despite this  i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie  
sadly  though  my fears were realized  
its just not possible to make an interesting  fulllength film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes  
the movie follows the rise and fall of gia  no last name   a tumultuous woman who doesnt particularly enjoy the world of fashion  
she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle  and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have  
the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high  losing a job  and going into rehab  
this formula is repeated several times  and i really got tired of it  
in general  i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use  
no because it offends me or anything like that  it just bores me  
quite frankly  i dont see the appeal  so when a director shows me a pointofview shot of a junkie  complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices  i am left somewhat unimpressed  
the first hour of the film  though  was actually quite engaging  
we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend  
these early scenes were interesting  
were shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes  and it was a perspective i hadnt seen before  
the movie begins to go downhill  however  once gia becomes an established model  
from that point  i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end  
it all seemed so excessive  
fine  so gia had a drug problem  does this really need to dominate the film  
couldnt the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs  
or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world  
quite possibly  although since i have no desire to become a model  this warning is lost on me  
as i stated at the beginning of this review  i simply dont see how the life of a model is worthy of a featurelength motion picture  
what do they do that warrants a movie  
strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour  
i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players  for example  but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life  
gia did not  
and by the end of the film  all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling  was bisexual  and was heavily into drugs  
not exactly a meaningful contribution to society  as far as im concerned
