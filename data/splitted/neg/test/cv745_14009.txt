conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that childrens items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twentyfive or thirty years after the item was made  
thats when the kids of that time have jobs  disposable income and a desire to revisit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and youll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  
theres a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the workaday world for a long time  
theyd like to recapture some of that fun they remember from days of yore  
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time  
and for the most part theyre messing it up  
  mission impossible    lost in space    godzilla    zorro   
none of these successfully capture the originals  
none of these are even good films  
you can now add  the avengers  to the list  
the british television series began in   
super secret agent john steed  thenpatrick macnee  and his third partner  emma peel  thendiana rigg  are the pair that the american audience fell for  
surrealistic and witty  the series fit the mood of the times  
the leatherclad rigg probably didnt hurt the ratings either  
after all its not a coincidence that you cant pronounce her characters name without  appeal   
now were in the nineties  
steed  nowralph fiennes  and peel  nowuma thurman  are battling evil genius sir august de wynter  sean connery  who is screwing with englands weather  
thats about as much of a plot as we have  
theres some footage about a lot of other things that either dont make sense or make even less sense  
we get betrayal for some unknown reason  
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film  
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason  
theres a high tech hot air balloon  but i have no idea why anyones in it  
the spy agency is run by a man called  mother  who is in a wheelchair and a woman named  father  who is blind    at 
least in some scenes  
theres probably a reason for all of this  but well never know it  
macnee makes an appearance of sorts  
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  
a group of villains sits around a table  all clad in huge pastelcolored teddy bear outfits  
at first its humorous to watch the teddies waddle around  but then it becomes goofy  
the movie is a medley of clutter  confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  
it feels like major portions of the film are missing  
the storyline jumps rather than flows  
reportedly the film was recut several times  
this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing  
theres one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher  
other than that  the effects are secondrate  
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes  
thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesnt work  
she looks good  dresses in all the right fetish outfits but theres no spark  
fiennes fares even less well  
macnees steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor  
fiennes agent comes across as a dour kid in grownup clothes who has never been out of his home town  
even connery  one of the greatest living actors  doesnt have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes  
the action scenes are difficult to follow  
director jeremiah chechik  responsible for the atrocious remake of  diabolique   somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldnt be  
things happen  people move around  but even if  with the utmost effort  you were able to care about any of it  the scenes are bewildering  
the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads  
witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination  
admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film  but theres no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever  
one of emma peels first lines of dialog is  rules are made to be broken   
it doesnt get any better  
advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone  
the release date was changed several times  
connery refuses to promote the film  
there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers  
at least this way  they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out  
admittedly i havent seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades  
my guess is that it would be severely dated now  
no matter how antiquated it might be  theres no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing  
theres no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie  
no reason at all
