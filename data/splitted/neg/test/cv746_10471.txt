the following review encompasses two versions of dune  
dune  the theatrical version    runtime   minutes capsule review  cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives  the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the films visual splendour  mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune  the extended version    runtime   minutes capsule review  a bit of a throwtogether assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but its considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the outofprint japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
    the review    
released in  and made on a then mammoth budget of  million  the film of frank herberts cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by scifi fans  
director david lynch  blue velvet  eraserhead  twin peaks  was working on his biggest production to date  a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynchs own  chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis  dune   a windswept desert planet thats home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly  it allows the navigators of the spacing guild  once human but now hideously mutated  to  fold space  and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously  enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynchs film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the storys two main strands  
one is the longstanding rivalry between two families  houses atreides and house harkonnen  and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah longawaited by the natives of arrakis  the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld  and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately  this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film  which runs  to  minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universals ohsowise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynchs initial cut running at closer to three or more hours  the studio demanded that further cuts be made  
what a great idea  
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible  
the most glaring consequence of this oneeyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative  leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  
thus their personalities are vague  their motivations unclear and  in the case of pauls father duke leto  their demise rather meaningless  
the end result is a distinct chill  we cant warm to most of the cast and we dont care much for them  
and it hardly helps that the voiceover narration is sparse and that the duneesque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  
dune is also a very serous film  
the constant  selftalk  by various characters makes it so serious and selfabsorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
humour  or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad  sadistic kind  is hard to find  
you may balk at the comparison  but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster  however  
it still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative scifi  
special effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms are an awesome sight  
both the production design  anthony masters  and costume design  bob ringwood  are striking and original  
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography  the film is at least a feast for the senses  
see it in the widescreen format if you can  
and despite all the cuts  several cast members still make a strong impression  most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  
sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam  leader of the bene gesserit religious order whos secret aim is to manipulate pauls destiny for its own shadowy ends  
as paul atreides  the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily  but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  
the conclusion  
any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herberts original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  
david lynch took a brave stab at it and  partly due to forces beyond his control  ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  
dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  
many chose to stay away altogether  as the films disastrous box office showing attests  
the extended version  however  is a rather different beast  
in  lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition  directors cut  of the film on home video  a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres  
but  alas  he failed to do so  choosing to move on to other projects  
in a way  then  it is partly lynchs own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version  put together in  by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa  
stung into action  lynch successfully petitioned the directors guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with  allen smithee   the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work  
he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous  judas booth   
certainly  looking at the results of mcas handiwork theres at least half a dozen instances that  for sheer technical sloppiness  are good enough reasons for the director to object  
but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas  
most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration  both of which fill many holes in the original versions storyline  
pauls relationship with his father and associates is more intimate  with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously  
the political skulduggery involving the emperor  the spacing guild  the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained  
pauls initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably  
and as further background  a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe  
as a piece of storytelling  then  mca tvs version of dune is clearly superior  
as a piece of editing  however  it is at times surprisingly inept  
the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough  but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate  
theres some sloppy cutting  too  and in a few instances shots even appear out of order  
and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes  eg  
ships coming and going  soldiers coming and going  is at times clearly outofcontext  
this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected  and rightly so  
it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u  s  television  
but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasnt even in herberts book  
the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his  heart plug   
its a surreal and disturbing episode thats very lynchesque but adds nothing to what we already know  the baron is a nasty piece of work  
despite its own peculiar flaws  then  the extended version of dune is a generally superior film  
all up  it contains  minutes of restored footage and approximately another  minutes of either altered  fabricated or newly created sequences  
unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart  the  alan smithee  version remains the closest well get to what the movie should have been  
on repeated viewings  one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit  
still  as one of this centurys great sciencefiction novels  some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen  
with rumours circulating of a new six hour miniseries planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in   it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga
