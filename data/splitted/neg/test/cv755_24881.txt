battlefield earth is the worst film of   and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close  
in fact  ill be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years  
based on the novel by scientology guru l  ron hubbard  battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information  
its the year   and an alien race called the psychlos  which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers  conquered our planet in nine minutes  
ok  we are all of  seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind  
when were we conquered  
the audience is led to believe that this happened about    years earlier  and if that is the case then were going to get into a whole bunch of problems later  trust me    
keep reading   
also  why dont we get to see earth get conquered  
how the hell do you make a popcorn scifi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film  
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor  and for the films first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver  colorado  
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  
so  when the psychlos conquered earth  were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills  
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered  whenever that was   
this is definitely not the way to start an actionscifi film  
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster  and he begins to fight it  
the  monster  turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course  
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course  with some shrubs growing over them  
so  in    years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time  with only a few weeds growing over it  
anyway  some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl  john travolta  a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  
the cavemen  led by barry pepper  are forced to do their bidding or whatever  but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet  or something  
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do    years earlier  
and  were supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who cant even handle a few cavemen  
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos  
so jets left unattended for    years are still able to fly  
please  if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood  
why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway  
shouldnt they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us  
the psychlos refer to humans as  man animals  but yet dogs are still  dogs   
why arent they  dog animals   
the psychlos are after mining earths precious resources  but for    years are unaware of fort knox  
why do i even care at this point  
im a fan of travoltas and im glad to see hes back on the alist in hollywood  despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon   
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie  
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here  
hes more than capable of making a menacing villain  see broken arrow and faceoff  but whenever his character came on screen i couldnt hold back my laughter  
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have  travolta just looks like travolta  
all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face  but travolta just has a goatee  
also  travoltas acts with a sort of phony upperclass snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world  
ooooo  scary villain  
as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better  
you can make a dumb but good scifi film  i love independence day for example   but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth  
i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening    
i cleaned my glasses  walked around the theater  made a grocery list  chose my lottery numbers for the week  replayed super bowl xxv in my head  with commercials     
and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids  
by the time we actually reach the year   people should still be avoiding this film  
folks  save your cash   
dont go see it  dont rent it  and dont buy it  
youd be more entertained by taking the money youd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind  watching it sail away  hell  send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal    
well entertain you plenty with that kind of money   
unless of course youre just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running  which is just about all youll come away with from this movie  
that  and a headache  
editors note  for some reason though  the day after my screening i converted to scientology  
im not sure why    
something just made me feel compelled make the choice
