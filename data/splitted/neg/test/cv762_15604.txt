if youre going to make a twohour hollywood injoke  why bother releasing it to the general public  
if youre going to create a film that will appeal primarily to bigname actors and people who know woody allen  then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters  
while watching celebrity  i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people  
what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited selfdeprecation  
celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself  living in a world that hes familiar with  dealing with people like the ones he actually knows  
allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture  in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more  
branagh plays lee simon  a journalistturnedscreenwriter who divorces his wife  robin  judy davis   shacks up with some hot women  famke janssen  charlize theron  winona ryder   and goes about trying to get big stars  melanie griffith  leonardo dicaprio  to read his script about an armored car robbery  
the usual elements of recent allen films are all here  including the sexual insecurity of the main character  lots of selfloathing women  and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another  
unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally  its not likely that youll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity  
aside from all the injokes  the story falls far short of compelling  and the characters are all empty and lifeless  
branagh proves once again that hes a superb performer  nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly  
the problem is that hes the same character allen always plays  a character whos getting more than a little dull to watch  
i mean  come on  how many times have you seen this guy  
 he hates his work  and he cant be satisfied by any one woman  and  at the end of the movie  nothing has been solved  
he brings all of his problems upon himself  crashing his car because hes receiving fellatio  and other such stunts   so its pretty hard to care about him  
in addition  isnt allen capable of creating characters who arent just like him  
i know he is  but he didnt do it in celebrity  
the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances  
davis  playing the same woman with low selfesteem that she played in deconstructing harry  has a few touching moments  but ends up the same despicable celebritytype that fills the rest of the movie  
some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty  theron and ryder  especially  but theyre not likable people  
only famke janssen  as a book editor interested in simons new novel  has any life  
the men in the picture dont do much better  joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin  while dicaprio  as a christian slaterjohnny depptype spoiled young actor  is funny but disengaging  
whats really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its  themes  are  
allen seems to think that hes making an insightful movie about the way  normal  people look at celebrities  
the main problem with this is that the character with whom were supposed to identify  simon  is not a  normal  guy  hes just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters  
the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us  none of them register as realistic  interesting characters  they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue  
in addition  allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly  robin  in this scene  says something like   its interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate     
celebrity is arguably allens biggest misfire to date  
it does have a few good scenes  therons superorgasmic model character is kind of funny  and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two  
but celebrity is a failure at the core  unless allens point was to make a selfindulgent movie about himself and his friends  
if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke  then he succeeded in that  
i  for one  dont enjoy feeling like an outsider
