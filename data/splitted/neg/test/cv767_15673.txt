everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap  from the roger cormangrade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign  the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi  the undiscovered country   
but pillers notquitehalfbaked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrections failure  
im about to give the same advice to rick berman and co  
as ive given to the financiers of james bond movies  its time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director  
  while were at it  put that visor back on laforge   
for three hundred years  the baku species  who look just like humans  have lived on a ringedplanet that might as well be called the fountain of youth  
six hundred of them occupy the briar patch  the area affected by metaphasic radition  a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly  
but evil ruafo  this is probably abrahams last stop before performing  amadeus  at a dinner theatre near you   leader of the sona  who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery   wants to relocate the baku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place  in order to replenish his dying breed  
the federation is all for this  but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive  to not interfere with the development of an alien race  
  never mind that the baku didnt exactly evolvethey went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world   
every time frakes gives an interview lately  he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment  
he has called it a comedy  a thinking mans picture  a throwback to the old series  and  most grievously  he has likened it to a john ford western  
  i presume thats some john ford he went to school with  not the director of the searchers   
he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version  
thats no excusesomeone generated this footage  
muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems  star trek  insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia  
consider such curiosities    
picards love interest  anij  donna murphy   can slow things down by staring at them  such as a waterfall or falling rocks  her scientific explanation for this  
  dont ask   
worf gets a pimple  hes reexperiencing klingon puberty thanks to the timedefying atmosphere   laforge regains his eyesight  trust me  levar burtons real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact  and troi brags about her firm boobs  but picard remains as bald as an androids butt  
most suspiciously  what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun  
the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts  and they also turn ruafo into a completely powermad superfreak  just so the characters will have something to do in the climax  
  and if youve seen return of the jedi  youve seen the ending of this movie   
didnt picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions  
frakes lucked out with first contact  and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection  he has no sense of comic timing  and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists  
  take a look at the painful  troi gets drunk  scene in fc and youll get the general idea of insurrections unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone   
even the worst shatner and co  
treks  like the final frontier  maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless  charming comaraderie between kirk  spock  and bones  
neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher  gates mcfadden  whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique   troi  or laforge  
and all three next generation films spend too much time on data  who is the franchises answer to urkel  
need a cheap laugh  
have data say something sexual  or start singing  or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if its the hunk of styrofoam it really is  
heres my proposed title for number   data star data trek  data data data data data  
in this movie  data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose  while crusher and troi watch silently from  yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation  
star trek  insurrection had one nice  eerie  silent moment that hints at a better  darker film  
im not saying all of them should be star trek ii  the wrath of khan  but this one boldly went where no movie should go again
