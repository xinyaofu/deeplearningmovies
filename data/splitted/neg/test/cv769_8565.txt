phew  what a mess  
for his fifth collaboration with director rich ard donner  lethal weapon iiii  maverick   mel gibson plays a motormouth  maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie  jerry  whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice  julia roberts  acting all serious   the justice department employee that he has a crush on  
she not interested  but another person is  a cia psychiatrist  patrick stewart  who promptly kidnaps him  
is one of jerrys conjectures correct  
  is  the metal strip in the new  bill being used to track your movements  
is oliver stone still alive  because he cut a deal with george bush to spread  dis  information  
is this movie really about  any  of the crazed cabbies theories  
no  no  and no  
as it turns out  theres some other nonsense going on here  involving and revolving around jerrys background  
  hint  pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back  in quick succession  to images of an interrogation room  hypodermic needles  and ms  roberts herself   
the  initial  premise is pretty good and is played  for a while  at a delightfully dizzying clip  
mel is wideropen that weve ever seen him and  if his characters relationship with roberts initially strains credibility  their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating  
  the highest wattage of the summer  perhaps   
even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude  the two remain a randy dandy screen pair  
theres a great scene in jerrys fortress  er  apartment  with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container  
  which he stores in another locked con tainer  his fridge   
other hilarious moments  of which there are many  include a trio of memorable conventionbreakers  where alice ditches a tail  jerry coldcocks someone  and  later  eludes a foot pursuit  each in a uproariously unexpected fashion  
  thats donners own ladyhawke playing in the theater  btw   
lets see  other pleasures include    
a brilliant title sequence  a jazzy score from carter burwell  and the worthpayingtosee sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming anothers head into a wall  
oh  pretty woman  
getting to the latter  however  requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story  
the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable  
more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here  except  perhaps  for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts  
and here i thought it was wabbit season  
good god  who rewrites these movies  
and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles
