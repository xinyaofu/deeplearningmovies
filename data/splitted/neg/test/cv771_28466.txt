plot  lara croft is british  rich and kicks a lot of ass  
she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in  years  and that lara holds the key to time  well  needless to say  they want to nab it from her  
oh yeah  lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts    hummanahummanahummana    
critique  angelina jolie was great in this movie  
there were also about three  action scenes  that were pretty cool to look at in this film  
uhhhhhm  unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked  
bad dialogue  generic sidekicks and bad guys  a lame mystery  yodaesque moments with mumbojumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end  
all in all  this movie wasnt the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about  especially since every other scene does feature jolies torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts  but it was quite the letdown nonetheless  especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool  hip woman hero  based on a popular video game  
i dont know  i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west  who didnt really tie the whole movie together all that well  
the film lacked energy  a consistent pace and well    a 
fun time  
i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie  
all that  father  crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing  and im not even gonna mention his moustache    hehehe   
why have this shite in the movie at all    
i especially hated the scenes in which some ghostlike figure  friend or child would ramble on about lara crofts father while all the time  im not giving one ounce of crap as to what theyre talking about  
i guess thats called lack of  character development   right  
thats when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen  so that we could actually  get into  it and care about them  
i didnt care about anyone in this movie  and was bored during most of its  lets explain why were doing all this gobbledygook  moments  
and even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass  damn  did she look sexy blasting those guns or what      everybody else around her was so goddamn boring  
her butler was a throwaway with no personality  her sidekick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word  bugger   and he says it a lot  trust me   and all of the socalled bad guys just spewed onedimension  
they had no spark  no energy amongst them  and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool  see the trailer and youll know which ones im talking about   the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bullcrap just buried it even further  
also  for a movie thats supposed to be about all of these exotic locations  i wasnt necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots  and even less so with its interiors  which all looked like they were shot in the same room  
mind you  i wont go as far as to say that its the  worst movie of the year   remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr  movies also    but its definitely the worst film that ive seen during this summer movie season  of course  its still early and im sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike   
skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead    trust 
me  youll miss the boobs but end your night with some rocksolid porn and its all good
