the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film  the world is not enough  is its final frame  white letters on a black background proclaiming  james bond will return   
oh i certainly hope not  
with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last goround as james bond    the world is not enough  is the best example to date that  enough  is enough  
in this  the th chapter in the seeminglyendless franchise featuring ian flemings debonair british secret agent who likes his martinisand his nemesesshaken not stirred  the subinspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups  stunts  and sexy encounters of the previous  bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original  
weve got previouslyused speedboat chases  ski chases  and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines  
weve got a couple of hottotrot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them  
weve got a postcold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction  here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean  lean panache   
and  as has been the case since s  the spy who loved me   weve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr  fleming  
weve also got a main title song by garbage to which  with very little effort  you can fit the lyrics to  both  songs from  tomorrow never dies   
while originality was never the series strong suit  the films were almost always fun  with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts  
i cant think of one memorable setpiece in the entireand very dull  the world is not enough   
in addition  michael apted  yes  the respected director of such films as  coal miners daughter    nell   and the  up  documentary series  takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich  s  
you get the  talking killer  plot deviceyou know the scenario  the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age  
and you get a slew of highpriced assassins who cant hit a barn door at  paces  in the films opening minutes  of an endless    bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leatherclad lovely fails to hit bonds soupedup  fishing boat  with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her  
later  she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out  
these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles  vodka  or credit cards  
in and among the rampant product placements  brosnan grapples with carlyle   braveheart  s sophie marceau  as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king  shes terrible    wild things   denise richards  as a nuclear physicist lord help me  shes laughable   and judi dench as m  dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its selfrespect  about the time roger moore inherited bonds walther ppk   
brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm youd expect of the former  remington steele  star  but even he has to be thinking theres more to life than an easy paycheck  
hes given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver  but only one of them  i dont know any doctor jokes  made me chuckle  although  i thought christmas only comes once a year  is more in keeping with the series penchant for grownworthy puns
