  its pathetic attempt at  improving  on a shakespeare classic  
  its just another piece of teen fluff  
  kids in high school are not that witty  
  the wittiness is not witty enough  
  the comedy is not funny  
  the acting is poor  
  the music  
  the poster  
  its worse than shes all that  
a classic borderline classic excellent good better than average average disappointing poor awful a crap classic
