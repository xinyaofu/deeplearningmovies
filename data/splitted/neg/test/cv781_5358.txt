after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy  i was ready for some mindless funoh  maybe something like tango  cash  
maybe not  
mindless fun is one thing  but braindead slop is another matter altogether  
tango  cash has  lowest common denominator  written all over it  
the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l  a  russell plays cash  a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts  
stallone plays tango  a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it  he doesnt need the money  
in an effort to change his image  stallone goes for a yuppie  gq look in the film  wearing spectacles and three piece suits  
the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names  
tango  cash is unbearably noisy  
for starters  theres harold faltermeyers annoying synthesized score  which gets old after four notes  
to make matters worse  the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars  the more the merrier  
in fact  the movie begins with not one but two car chases  
theres nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie  
screenwriter randy feldmans brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv  
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it  such as stallones efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual  
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba  even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligentand stallone is no lawrence olivier  
its hard to imagine anyone reading feldmans script and thinking   i want to be in this movie   
the films plot doesnt have one original bone in its body  andagainyou have to point your finger at the screenwriting  
feldmans story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book  making tango  cash altogether generic and predictable  
they simply could have called it  action movie   
every character  every twist and turn  is stolen from television or from other movies  
adding insult to injury  tango  cash is about as believable as a  road runner  cartoon  
action movies dont have to be realistic  but they should absorb you enough so that youre not thinking about the lack of realism  
the only artistic aspect of tango  cash is the cinematography  
there are some spectacular shots  especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires  
the films main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell  
unfortunately  their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants  
the dialogue consists of nothing but oneliners  and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing  
its a shame because with a workable screenplay  russell and stallone could have turned tango  cash into a charming  lethal weaponesque  adventure  
tango  cash tries to maintain a light tone  and you do laugh about once every five minutes  
seeing russell in drag is the movies funniest moment  but you probably already have seen it in the commercials  
furthermore  the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence  
machine guns and torture generally dont mix well with comedy  
jack palance appears in tango  cash doing what he does best  playing a sleazy  conniving villain  
his character  however  is runofthemill  except for his strange obsession with mice  
like many movie villains  palance likes to play games  
in fact  he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash  a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room  
you have to wonder why palance doesnt just shoot the detectives in the head  
the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent  
teri hatcher plays stallones sister and russells loveinterest  and she is just as pretty as can be  
but regrettably  hatchers acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty  
every time she opens her mouth  you cringe  corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination  
theres really very little  if anything  to recommend in the film  
and  more to the point  tango definitely isnt worth a penny of your cashso dont bother
