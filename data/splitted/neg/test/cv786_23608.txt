  mission to mars  is one of those annoying movies where  in the middle of the movie  you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie  all five minutes of it  
  mission   does  give you payoff  but when it does come  its too little  too late  
  mission  has some good ideas  but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery  dimeadozen dialogue  and spate of good actors wasted in cardboardcutout roles  
im sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with  so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm  
glances dont communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end  
the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff  building to its climax  
a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships  marriage  friendship  unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap  
there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film  and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know  trying is the key word here   
the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching  but as mentioned by then were so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over  
great design  good intentions  but no cigar  
if youre not a die hard scifi  fx or jerry oconnell fan  his character is the only one who has some semblance of character   dont waste your eight bucks on this  
and what the hell  tim robbins died halfway through the movie  in a stupid way too  
thats just unforgiveable
