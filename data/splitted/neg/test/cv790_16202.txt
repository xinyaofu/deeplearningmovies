americas favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in  bride of chucky   and their unholy matrimony is something old  nothing new  
the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers  however  has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up  but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their bloodsoaked honeymoon  
the answer is a sickandtwisted yes  and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hotenoughtomeltrubber  or at least singe it  lovin  
guess theyre anatomically correct  
chucky  again voiced by brad dourif   of course  is the star of the  childs play  series  a my buddytype doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer  
in  bride   the plot  heh  picks up with his girlfriend tiffany  jennifer tilly  resurrecting chuckys remains  he was blown up at the end of  childs play    with the help of a black arts manual called  voodoo for dummies   
silly mortal  
before long  shes also been reduced to shinhigh figurine status  and the plastic incarnations of these onetime lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies  
the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young couple  nick stabile and katherine heigl  with conjugal plans of their own  leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical  soultransferring amulet allegedly lies in wait  
along the way  our murderous barbie and ken go through postmarriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds  bicker  argue  kiss and make up  
but when they squabble over whos going to do the dishes  watch out  
hey  even faux people have got to work through their problems  
director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two  but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing  
when one of them charges  its nothing a good forward punt couldnt take care of  
and when a climactic chase scene is needed  one of the dimbulb protagonists must pickchuckyup so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint  
throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending  will  son of chucky  be next   and this is a bizarrely bad minutes at the movies  
as is the thing to do in post  scream  slasher cinema  don mancinis screenplay slathers on the injokes and genreparody  
but little of the humor succeeds  proving selfreference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite  
to be fair  though  most of  bride of chucky  is on autopilot  so its not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film  
similarly shaky  the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland  the effects arent that special and the story is one big groaner  
heres hoping chucky and his entire clan  past  present and future  rest in peace
