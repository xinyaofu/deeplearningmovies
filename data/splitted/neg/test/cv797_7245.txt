be warned   
brit love story in the offing  
effeminate  mildmannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower  his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite  
he is only just saved by prentice  who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average streetwise punkinthemaking  
the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school  
they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas  
in that time  prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable  if brash and bullheaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets  motorcycles and punk rock music  
karl  on the other hand  has grown up to become kim  a drabby  insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company  
chance brings the two together  and love  such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy  is what this skewed little story is largely about  
if at this point you think youre going to get any cheap laughs with that genderbending theme  see the birdcage  to wong foo     priscilla queen of the desert   you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you lowlife deadbeat  
kim is a postoperative transsexual  thank you very much    
a newborn woman for all purposes  with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy  
personally  give me those cheap laughs any day  
id rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft hearted transsexual love story  
different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition  but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it  
by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentices relation ship  or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them  prentice for example  doesnt seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fightpicking  beerdrinking  macho kind of guy  and kim  for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film   and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story  the film manages to lobotomise itself  
lightweight comedy as its doomed to be  it couldve still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple  
but this doesnt either  since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintoshs kim foyle  and as either sex  hes just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like  
prentice does though  and thats never explained  
but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice  the guy who never grew up  and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks concert  he should win that too  that i guess theres no reason to explain why hes so screwed up  
if oddly enough you grow to like this show  youll be wanting your happy ending  and the film wont fail you there either  
snide underling at kims office gets her comeuppance  
misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his comeuppance  
the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kims apartment  
kims sister and her impotent sargetype husband kiss and make up after a tiff  tv movie subplot with incidental juxtaposition   
and best of all  kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers  making prentice ride pilion  
awwww  
terrific closure  
happy ending  
but just what is it thats differnt for girls anyway  
if you figure that one out  let me know  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv broadcast  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
