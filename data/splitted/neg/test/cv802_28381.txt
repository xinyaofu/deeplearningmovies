if youve been following william fichtners career  and theres absolutely no reason why you should have   you might have noticed that hes played some rather similar roles over the years  
like sully in  the perfect storm  tough  gruff  and a little bit scary  
or law in  albino alligator  tough  gruff  and little bit scarier  
or colonel william sharp in  armageddon   or dwayne engelman in  strange days   or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of  pearl harbor   as the abusive father of dannyhere is an actor who gravitates towards tough  gruff  hardhitting roles  
which is why his performance in  whats the worst that could happen   
is such a shock  such a delight  
in the film  fichtner plays a blonde haired  meticulously dressed  overtly effeminate  dogloving detective  
as alex tardio  fichtners performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it  
it borders on offensive but doesnt really manage it  
and it borders on clich  d stereotype but doesnt quite succumb to that definition either  
in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming  fichtner isnt perfectyou can see him struggling a little at times  concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air  or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personalbut hes pretty damned good  and silly  and without question the best thing in the film  
in fact  had it not been for fitchners sudden and bizarre appearance  and his jarring screen presence thereafter  i would have walked out  for  whats the worst that could happen   
is mesmerizing in its awfulness  a poorly written  haphazardly edited  and totally unfunny  yes  it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible   
moviegoing experience  
fichtners performance doesnt exactly save the film  and its not like im recommending  whats the worst that could happen   
solely on the strength of the actors dramatic turnaround  but his contributions do raise the films rating from no stars to oneandahalf  
thumbs up to fichtner then  and thumbs downway  way  downto everyone else involved in this sorry mess  a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesnt even warrant discussion
