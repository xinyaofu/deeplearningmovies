and i thought  stigmata  would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year  
turns out i was wrong  because while  stigmata  was merely boring and selfimportant   end of days  is completely inept on all fronts  
its a silly  incomprehensible  endlessly stupid mess  
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best  its extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  
for the first time in recent memory  an arnold action movie  and  batman  robin  doesnt count  is no fun at all  
  end of days  is a major stinker  
the movie opens in vatican city    
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy  which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  
if he impregnates her between  and midnight on december     the world will be destroyed  
the pope orders protection of this girl  though some priests believe she ought to be killed  
in new york  that very night  a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  
twenty years later  we meet jericho cane  schwarzenegger   a suicidal excop with a drinking problem  
now working as a security guard for hire  he is protecting a local businessman  gabriel byrne   who is actually possessed by the devil  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after  christine york  robin tunney   
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine  including ownership of the same music box  apparently   jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  
there are so many problems with this film its hard to know where to begin  but how about starting with the concept  
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  
schwarzenegger is a persona  not an actor  so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
in other words  trying to give him dimension was a mistake  
harrison ford  mel gibson  or even bruce willis could have played this role  theyve all played noble and flawed heroes   but not schwarzenegger  
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jerichos character  one has him contemplating suicide  another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter  and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christines location by offering him his old life back  
none of these scenes really work  because arnie isnt up to the task  
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong  confident character  like the terminator  for example   the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  
this one isnt at all believable the way arnold plays him  
the supporting cast tries their hardest  and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  
as the prince of darkness  hes suave and confident  
he acts like one would expect the devil to act  
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense  more on that later  and that undermines him as a powerful villain  
byrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together  including the aforementioned temptation bit   but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable  root for the devil  
byrnes speech about the bible being  overrated  actually starts to make sense  mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it  mostly of the  tis not   
variety  are feeble at best  
the only problem is  arnold has to win  so in the end  nobody really cares  
kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides  but like most bad action movie sidekicks  he disappears after about an hour  
robin tunney isnt given much to do except look scared  
in fact  all of the supporting players are good actors  but none  save for byrne  is given anything interesting to do  
performances aside  it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it  
this being an action blockbuster  its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script  which starts off totally confusing  and when some of it is explained  and not much of it is   its utterly ridiculous  
why is the devil coming on new years eve    
because its exactly  years after the year of the devil  which isnt   it turns out  
some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down  so the real year is   so just add a  to the beginning  and youve got   
if you dont buy this explanation  youre not alone  
its convoluted and silly at the same time  
the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous  shes christine  see  and she lives in new york  see  
  
    and if that werent bad enough  theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all  
why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street  but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk excop  hes powerless  
is he impervious to only one kind of bullet  
how come he cant control jericho or christine  
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies  
a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this  but its never actually explained  
usually  this sort of thing wouldnt matter in a schwarzenegger flick  i mean  dont get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies   but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting  
there are several predictable horror film clich  s present in  end of days   complete with the old  black cat hiding in a cabinet  bit  not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there  
it gets so formulaic that its possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a  boo  will come  
their predictions will rarely be wrong  
the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless  partially because we dont care about these characters  due to the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup   and also because they  too  dont make any sense  
theres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady  
its good for a few chuckles  but not much else  
supposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan  but the script never sets that up  so the scene is merely silly  
none of this is terribly exciting  because all the action sequences are so badly framed that its often hard to tell why its happening in the first place  not to mention that theyre edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style  
most of them had me scratching my head  rather than saying   wow  cool   
  end of days  is not only silly and confusing  but its also distinctly unpleasant to watch  
the devil apparently doesnt operate in the more subtle  illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible  but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight  
this doesnt only make him an awfully predictable sort  but it also means that not a single scene in  end of days  goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence  or the odd kinky sexual encounter  yet another bit that had me scratching my head   
if violence is supposed to be shocking  its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb  
scenes arent connected through any reasonable means  so a lot of the time  stuff gets blown up  or people get killed  and i had no idea why  
reasons  
to hell with reasons  
lets just blow stuff up  
isnt it cool  
nope  not by a long shot  
this film is thoroughly unwatchable  
its dull  interminable  and unrelenting in its stupidity  
perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career  because its not happening with hack peter hyams here  
  end of days  might have had camp value  if only it didnt top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobodys going to buy  
if the movie is going to be serious  the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script  
if its going to be campy  arnold shouldnt be taking himself so damn seriously  i didnt actually see him put up on a cross  did i    and his character shouldnt be such a sad sack  
as it stands   end of days  is just a bad movie  and an awfully gloomy one at that
