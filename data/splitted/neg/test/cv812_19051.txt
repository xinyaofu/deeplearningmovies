plot  set in the future  a courier has uploaded some data into a  hard drive  that resides in his head  and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information  
since he overloaded his  hard drive   hes also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him  
critique  incoherent  boring  oneact drivel with no suspense  horribly unbelievable futuristic environment  bad dialogue  careerdefining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending  
its too bad because the premise of the film was interesting  but unfortunately for my friends and i  this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us  
its one of those films that makes you start laughing halfway through  when you realize that most of the actors in it suck  the location shots are filmed in dark  junkyard  type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic  whatever      and all the sets look like     well  
sets  
there is also absolutely no arc to this story  
it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain  and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings  
gibson should stick to writing novels and  xfiles  episodes  since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage  
some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass  henry rollins as a pumpedup cyberdoctor or something  and icet as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face  dont ask   
the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghostlady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point  
im ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal  canada  but sadly enough for us all  it was  
some of the cybertravelling special effects were okay  hence  the    but overall  its one of those bad movies thats just funny to watch and cringe at  
thankfully for keanu  he redeemed his scifi career with s the matrix       
its too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent  
little known facts about this film and its stars  as of   director robert longo never directed another fullfeature film  
hmmm    now 
isnt that odd  
   writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in   after being rejected for the draft  
he lived in toronto at first  but since   has made vancouver his home  
his  novel  neuromancer  and its sequels s  count zero  and s  mona lisa overdrive  are generally considered to be the definitive works of the  cyberpunk  sciencefiction subgenre  
this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the  worst actor  category in the  razzie awards
