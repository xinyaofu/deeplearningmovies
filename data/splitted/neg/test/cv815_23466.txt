when i watch a movie like mike nichols what planet are you from  
i cant help but feel like everyone is looking at me  
its as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness  eyes shooting daggers  quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hardearned money to spend their time watching this    
this    
thing  
i shift uncomfortably in my seat  
im reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second or thirdrate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted  funny  conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award  
its not my fault  i know its not my fault  but dammit  someones gotta be embarrassed  because it doesnt look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame  
im about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together  garry shandling  annette bening  john goodman  greg kinnear  mike nichols  
do any of these names make you instantly shudder  
the answer i would have come up with before today is no  this is quite a list of talented individuals weve got here  
granted  john goodman was in the flintstones  and greg kinnear has turned in some lessthanlackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours  but even so  theyve got proven power as excellent supporting players  
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt  his ingenious little its garry shandlings show and the larry sanders show  
and for gods sake  mike nichols directed the graduate  and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
so explain this    
this    
thing  
what planet are you from  
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole poppsychology marsvenus phenomenon  
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringeinducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringeinducing moments  the end result is  unsurprisingly  an unfunny  uninsightful  cringeinducing  thoroughly icky embarrassment  
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males  they reproduce through cloning  of course   
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth  find a female of the species  and impregnate her  
theyre taught how to pretend that theyre listening by nodding and saying  uhhuh   and how to compliment shoes  
imagine my delighted surprise when  oh heavens  all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably  producing comedic results  
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis  since theirs  after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence    
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that theyre all just clones    
whoops  too late   
the penis  when aroused  tends to make a humming noise  
the writers  when frequently strapped for ideas  tend to turn to this as a source of  comedy   
it isnt funny the first time  
it isnt funny the eighth time  
it isnt funny the eighteenth time  
if anything  it made me feel vaguely selfconscious  
garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear  who turns out to be a generic  unlikable scumbag  
hes meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandlings alien character  but hes so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside  
kinnears scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks  
wow  
what a magnificent bastard  
nearly every man in the movie  in fact  is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball  
when kinnears wife walks into the office  there isnt a single guy who doesnt trip  bump into a wall  or otherwise pratfall as if theyd never seen a woman before  
the few guys that arent particularly slimeballs  such as john goodmans detective character  are simply uncommunicative workaholics  
shandling meets up with annette bening  who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed  at one of kinnears aa meetings  
shandlings mission is to have a baby  and when he reveals his desires to her  bening instantly falls for him  and the next day    
they get married  
yup  
the next day  
cuz ya see  it turns out she wants a baby too  
benings character perhaps was the most difficult to watch  especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty    
if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole  then woe  i say  to the species  
shes unfathomably insecure  and succumbs so easily to all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic  
theres a point where  after thinking she may not be able to bear children  she learns that she is indeed pregnant  
when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her  she strolls into the kitchen and sings  high hopes   you know  the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song  to deliver the news  and then says to him   now you cant leave me   
were supposed to empathize with shandlings discovery of the feeling of  guilt   but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing  
and eventually  shandling falls in love with her    
for real  i suppose  though im not sure exactly what prompted it  
whats the message i derive from all this  
men are liars  inherently empty creatures  but if you hang around long enough    
well  maybe something will click  
ha ha    
ha  
im thankful such broad cynicism isnt frequently allowed to run so rampant  
lets all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one  
theres also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity  
goodman  through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations  puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic  vibrating penis  
it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered  that  thankfully  never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition  
instead  it just dangles limply on the branch for a while  withers  and falls away  
further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies  
but lets not dwell on this any longer  ive already wasted plenty of your time and my own  
lets move on  forget about what weve seen here  and get on with our lives  
and to help us out  lets end things on a happy note    
congratuations go out to annette bening  winner of this weeks  title   
award  for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movies name
