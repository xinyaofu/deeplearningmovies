sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime  but this has got to be one of the worst  
a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting   the specialist  is about as exciting as an episode of  dragnet   and about as well acted  
even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script  stupid and unlikable characters  and just plain nothingness  
who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anticlimactic  
unless you saw  blown away     
  the specliast  of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone  in comeback   i think   who plays a quiet  hermitlike bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something  but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant  james woods  who shows us exactly what overthetop is  other than another bad sly film  accidentally killed some innocent people during a job  
his credo is killing bad people  not innocents  
and thats why he makes big bombs  
so anyway  into his life steps the seductive sharon stone  who is basically the girlfriendmoll of the stupid son  eric roberts  of a cubanmiami kingpin  rod steiger  in an indecipherable accent  which is sometimes cuban  sometimes brando  sometimes scottish  etc   
turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him  since he killed her parents when she was young  
so she calls sly  leaves messages with him  sends him email  etc  about planting a bomb to kill roberts  which sly listens to obsessively  and while he works out naked  
yea  
also into his life  though again  comes woods  who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly  
using the cops  he tries to set up traps  none which really work  so when sly calls him  he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone  getting so worked up by saying his mustbeimprovised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open  
these are the most exciting scenes in the film  and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film  
the film tries to offer us a moody film noir  except with explosions  but comes up completely snakeeyes  
its just a pretend film noir  making it a big waste of time  
and for action buffs  the action scenes are pretty lame  with some really unrealisticlooking special effects  a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub   
then theres the muchdiscussed sex scene between sly and stone  which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on  friends   
their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy  because it shows us more of sly than stone  
now lets guess who wed rather see naked  okay  
stones small but perky breasts  which weve seen more times than harvey keitels dick  or stallones veiny ass  which isnt usually shown for a very good reason  
i know i cant really judge it as a flaw of the film  but come on  
the worst flaw of the film is this  its boring  
i mean  i was on caffeine when watching it  but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting  
but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make  
if youre in for some fun action  rent slys earlier  demolition man   which sucks too  but in a much more entertaining fashion  
skip this dull film  unless you want to see woods  or make fun of steigers accent  or see stones breasts again
