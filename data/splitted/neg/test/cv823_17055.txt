starring shawnee smith  donovan leitch  ricky paull goldin  kevin dillon  billy beck the blob is the remake of the s classic  a term that i use very loosely to define the original  about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way  
now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel  
the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesnt exactly hurt it either  
fast forward to the late s  
steve mcqueen isnt in the remake  this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years   
nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role  
that is unless you count matt dillons brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter  
the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original  
the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets  
it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets  
the special effects in this movie are cheesy  like the originals  
unlike the original  they dont look campy  they just look cheap  
one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith  
she is very attractive and can actually act  which is more than i can say about some of her costars  
in terms of plot  a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky  
seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite  
anyway  the pink stuff has a taste for humans  
the more people it absorbs  the bigger it gets  
and it isnt the friendliest goop on the block either  
anyway  it attacks this little town and its up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it  
not really  but that is how it seems  
this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original  
as ive already said  this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap  badly acted  and badly written than campy  
in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness  
although  star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon  
the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple  they all stunk out loud  
although some of the films smaller roles are filled with some actors that  while not big stars  are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows  
it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible  
sadly  it doesnt work very well  
if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town  then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original  
  although that isnt so hot either   
this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities
