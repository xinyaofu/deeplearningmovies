ive always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid  
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded  you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are  no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat  and no idea how long the ride will last  
then theres the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychninelaced dose  
mushrooms  on the other hand  offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel  a steady  reassuring assent  a short period of thrilling motion and color  and then a smooth landing  
acid is for daredevils  mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy  
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas  director terry gilliam has made an acid movie  when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie  
full of shocking sight gags  aggressive images and grotesque comic performances  the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s  thompsons book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological worldview from the inside out  
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a wellmade film  gilliam has produced a mixed bag  
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how selfprofessed  gonzo  journalist hunter s  thompson  johnny depp  and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta  benicio del toro   came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorneys convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in   
operating under the pseudonyms of  raoul duke  and  dr  
gonzo   the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender  then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite  cocaine  tequila and a rainbow of multicolored uppers and downers  
they terrorize every one they meet  mostly because every one they meet terrifies them  
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town  then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge  
dr  gonzo becomes enamored of a thickbladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplanes  white rabbit  reaches its climax  
and these guys dont just trash hotel rooms  they rape them  humiliate them and leave them for dead  
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence  depending on your point of view  
thompsons book  besides being a hilarious read  has stood the test of time as an important historical document  
it simultaneously exposed the s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die  
pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompsons message  but the truth is that  stripped to its bare essentials  what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy  
its a cheech and chong movie  
youre there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results  see johnny take drugs  see johnny fall down  
theres nothing wrong with this concept  but gilliam tries too hard  
this is a frantic movie  all sweaty closeups  wideangle lenses  dutch tilts and otherworldly lighting schemes  
there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen  
but to what end  
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompsons book  and there are some priceless comic observations  
but youre hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work  
this brings us to the performances  which strike me as all wrong  
depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c  scott in patton  a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompsons dialogue  
in between his several puking scenes  del toro fares better as dr  gonzo  but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost  
watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago  with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads  now that would have been something to see  
its interesting to note that alex cox  credited as a cowriter on the screenplay  was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over  
as much of a fan as i am of gilliams work  cox would have been the better choice  
sid and nancy  coxs best work  covered essentially the same subject matter  but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film  
gilliam commits the compound sin of overdirecting his film while being uncertain of his purpose  
what kind of movie was he trying to make  anyway  
it doesnt try to be a cautionary tale  and it doesnt work as broad comedy  
if he had considered more carefully his purpose  the result would have been a much more interesting film  
but i dont want to be too hard on it  
there are some truly funny moments  and if youre in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it  
i do  however  recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance  i guarantee it will enhance the effect
