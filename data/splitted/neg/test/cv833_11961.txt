im guessing  and from the available evidence  its not a great guess  that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess  stupidity  ego and powermongering  
if so  the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history  
it has already been welldocumented that the original title  an alan smithee film  became a problem when miserable test screenings forced recuts against the will of director arthur hiller  prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guildmandated pseudonym of alan smithee  
that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas  as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor  
and you could just smell the disaster brewing  
if youre unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn  youll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up  
ostensibly  its a pseudodocumentary account of a director named alan smithee  eric idle  who loses control of a bigbudget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone  whoopi goldberg and jackie chan  all of whom appear as themselves   
when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called  an alan smithee film   which  of course  it already is  smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it  
among the parties interviewed are the films producer james edmunds  ryan oneal  and studio boss jerry glover  richard jeni   who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them  
its bad enough that burn hollywood burn has  literally  not a single laugh for its entire  blissfully brief  minutes  
what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once  but twice or even three times  
michael ovitz references  showgirls references  oral sex references  whoopi goldbergted danson references  all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stockintrade  
the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency  notably with the hilarious use of the word  feminist  as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film  
by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent filmmakers the brothers brothers  cleverly identified as  bad a  and  badder a   among other unprintable things   you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified  
those documentary captions  for all their leaden obviousness  allow the best insight into whats so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn  
not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit  eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears  
the producer is a  liar  who  slept in the white house   the media are  maggots  and  leeches  working for publications like  the new york slimes  and  newsleak   with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you dont miss the joke   
it doesnt even matter that eszterhas tags  penile implant  after his own name when he makes a cameo  because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign selfdeprecation  
this is a petulant schoolboys idea of satire  pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth  
the last stomachchurning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with outtakes over the closing credits  the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away  
perhaps it was just a final  desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film  or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career  
pity everyone involved with this excessive  egodriven  satire  of excess and ego  
its too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this  
otherwise  you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees
