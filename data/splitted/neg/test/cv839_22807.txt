isnt it the ultimate sign of a movies cinematic ineptitude when you cant think of much to say about it other than  it sucks   
one of the first official year  releases  supernova is such a movie  
i cant seem to get past oneword adjectives with this one  although  boring    stupid  and  absurd  doesnt amount to much of a review  
a shame  
i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate  
but cest la vie  
here goes nothing  
ill keep it short  
i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill   hours  removed his name from the movie  requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee  
the films fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press  an event usually signifying a studios lack of confidence in a particular movie  
hills and mgms actions were prudent  
when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident  a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer  for some reason  james spader  is forced to take command  
the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and  on arrival  picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony  
one of the crew members  angela bassett  knows this passenger  who is played by peter facinelli  and has some bad feelings about it  and we all know what that means  
this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo  a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown  though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it  
another one of the crew members experiences this first hand  after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo  he does some impressive handstand pushups  
evidently  touching this enigmatic eggshaped thingie makes you younger and stronger  
how  
why  
the movie never bothers to explain  
soon enough though  spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad  being chased by the allofasuddensuperhuman facinelli  
to be honest  i dont even remember exactly why  
i just remember that i didnt care  
supernovas plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas  such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb  but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing  
in fact  everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set  
well  the effects are good  though theres hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so im not sure whether thats so remarkable an accomplishment  
the performances are hardly worth talking about  
im not even sure i can call whats here  performances   though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger  
james spader is not a bad actor  but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars ive seen in a while  mostly because he isnt given a character with a personality  
the action scenes are just as bland  since theyre pretty much just rehashes of action elements that werent particularly entertaining the first time around  
and since the action scenes are everything to this movie  its pretty much dead in the water  
and for the life of me  i cant figure out why its called supernova
