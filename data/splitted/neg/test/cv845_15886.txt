what a contrast  
in the space of two days  i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly  
im not sure you could get two more different movies  
while the former was all over the top  telegraphing everything  shoving its philosophy of life down our throats  hurlyburly was the complete opposite  wound so tight and with so much buried in its script  one could spend weeks thinking about it  
this is one interesting movie  
its very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of   in the company of men  although not quite so nasty  
theres lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men  
hurlyburly doenst contain much plot  we just follow eddie  sean penn  around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him  
his big question is  does it all pertain to him  
and if it does  how is he supposed to feel about it all  
  it  means everything  television  friends  events that happen  
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as  whats it all about  
this is not a movie for answers  
donna  anna paquin  gives some but theyre not really satisfying  they just lead to more questions  
thats what makes this movie stay on your mind  
these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time  
even when we push them to the background  however we resolve these questions influences everything we do  
the performances are all superb in hurlyburly  
i havent seen sean penn in much before  in fact  i cant remember seeing him in anything   but he is brilliant in this  
eddie isnt a likeable character  but sean penn makes him understandable  
i dont want to be his friend but id like to help him  
chazz palminteri is also great as phil  making him an awful person  
id never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend  
everyone in this film nails their performances  making this world real  
its a nasty world  its a sexist world  
unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct  hurlyburly is a mans world  seen unapologetically through the eyes of men  
i find this fascinating and on two counts  depressing  
first  its depressing that such a world exists  
a large part of hurlyburlys success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood  that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world  toys  playthings  
sure  everyone is background to everyone else but in this world  women are a long way in the background  
second  these are the movies that are being made  stories about mens world  
where are the stories about womens world  
not the soap operas and the  chick flicks  that are meant to satisfy women  but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men  
hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts  
its very talkative  intelligent and static  
while this can make the film drag a bit  and people sometimes sound like theyre quoting textbooks  mostly this is a good thing  
not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas  
not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience  
all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen  
it also means that you have to pay attention
