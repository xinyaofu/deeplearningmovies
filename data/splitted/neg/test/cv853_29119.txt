its a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise  
the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying  
osmosis jones is crude  gross  disgusting  and was directed by the farrelly brothers  the twisted siblings behind theres something about mary  me  myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt  
not that theres anything wrong with scatology  
i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor  such as it was  
its merely that with osmosis jones  the farrellys humor is too juvenile  too predictable  
you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn  
osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho  
the trouble is  the animation may please the very young  but the jokes may be over their heads  while the teenage audience may find it too tame for their tastes  
adults  well  lets just say most will find it unappetizing  
osmosis jones plays like a minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby  
the live action sequences revolve around frank  bill murray   who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe  
he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower  
frank  much to the consternation of his daughter  is a fastfood addict  eating anything  and everything  that can kill you  
he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner  and presumably smell better  than he does  
franks body is invaded by thrax  a lethal virus  after frank eats a hardboiled egg that had fallen to the ground  
its not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth  
nope  the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg  wresting it from the primates mouth  
like i said  the gross meter tips the scales on this one  
after ingesting the egg  the movie begins its animated sequences  
here  osmosis jones  voiced by chris rock   a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix  voiced by frasiers david hyde pierce   a hour  painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax  smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne   
basically  what we have is a cliched copbuddy movie  rife with all the clich  s of that genre  
and this is why osmosis jones doesnt click  
it merely falls back on tired  familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations  
the jokes and puns are lame  osmosis searches out a snitch  a former flu virus  
after pumping him for information  drix tells osmosis   funny  he doesnt look fluish   
and the jokes dont rise above that level  
the live action scenes are no better  
frank is such a slob  so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child  
hes almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters  
osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left  
the animation is rather twodimensional and flat  
it lacks scope and depth  
it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head  and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater
