i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year  when matthew perry had just signed on  
im big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor  and in addition  i think chris farleys onedge  extreme acting was a riot  
so naturally  when the trailer for  almost heroes  hit theaters  i almost jumped up and down  
a soda in hand  the lights dimming  i was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough  
i was ready to be just amazed  for this to be among farleys best  in spite of david spades absence  
i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran  
sadly  none of this came to pass  
the humor is spotty at best  with good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between  
perry and farley have no chemistry  the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade  for its his type of humor  and not at all what perry is associated with  
and the movie tries to be smart  a subject best left alone when its a farley flick  
the movie is a major dissapointment  with only a few scenes worth a first look  let alone a second  
perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie  and not surprisingly  the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley  
and farleys classic humor is widespread  too  
almost heroes almost works  but misses the wagontrain by quite a longshot  
guys  lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark  huh  
stick to  tommy boy   and well all be  friends
