one of these days  ill make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie  
king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding  and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single  emotive viewing   his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary arthouse trappings  
its a perfumedrenched  cokeaddled visit to the seedy pornography shop  where beautiful models  no  hookers  no  courtesans  usher you through the silk curtains  
ferraras only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again  since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever hes onscreen  
his minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal  unwatchable  and pretentious failure  
when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements  or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch  theres a muchneeded dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair  
you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know theyre actually having fun  
the addiction is that movie  
walken  sadly  does not appear in the blackout  
the central role of matty  a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction  is played by matthew modine  who takes what he can get after cutthroat island   
much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonionis terminally bored cultural elite  matty is involved in a bitter pill  relationship  with high fashioned model annie  at least i think shes a model   
mattys lady is played by french actress b  atrice dalle  arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout  not that you needed to know that  but it lends credence to the idea that ferraras entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout  
no kidding  
requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferraras movies and his controversial urban lifestyle  
matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him  
no doubt  he was off chasing the dragon  
in his despair  matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery  tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne  dennis hopper  in full  dirty ol man  mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs  
wider   
toward the end of the night  they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie  sarah lassez   start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene  then matty thankfully blacks out  
something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie  and its exactly what you think it was  
suffice to say  theres some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two  or anyone at all  
the blackout is typical ferrara  no plot to speak of  plenty of raunch  and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a seethrough curtain in his hotel room by the sea  by the sea  by the beautiful sea  
cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docustyle sleaze  and were back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits  
  yeah    
yeah    
arrrghhh   
says mr  hopper  
dirty old sod   
its compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way  leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny  
hows that for cryptic  
never fear  ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what hes all about  
i can picture it now  
  take off yer clothes  kid  its essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist  and youre his visual id  
youre the soul  the heart  the bloodstream of the picture  
take it off  
take it all off    
ha ha ha   
friggin vampire  
yeah  you  ferrara  
a final word about matthew modine  hes actually a fine actor when properly cast  but theres something too squeakyclean in his demeanor  
hes ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations  such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the timebomb nebbish in short cuts  who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene  though no one seems to notice him   
he was in that scene  
ed   
here  hes asked to let it all hang out  sporting a threeday stubble and oily bangs  
he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski  but its somehow lacking  
modine lacks the feral intensity of brando  entirely miscast in ferraras flesh fair  
better luck next time  matt  
someday  youll be forgiven for cutthroat island  which wasnt really your fault in the first place  
maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere  and all will once again be well in your world
