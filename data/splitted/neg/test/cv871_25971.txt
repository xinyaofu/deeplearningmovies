paul verhoeven  the dutch auteur who dragged his violent  sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film  has never been what id consider a thoughtful director  though some of his films  notably starship troopers  have been lauded as artistic achievements   but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to  no matter what the budget  make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  
starship troopers was essentially a bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange  a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video  yet showgirls is everywhere   in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins  the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards  who may actually be  silicone   in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
its not a completely successful film  but as a failure its certainly an interesting  and mostly entertaining  one  
my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores  spetters  a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange  havent yet gotten around to seeing the th man or turkish delight   
i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop  a bleak superhero satire with a robotic hero thats as touching as schwarzeneggers in t  
that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  
its violence seemed to be there for a purpose  namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread  not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  
theres a jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him  
he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic  
its a startling moment of barbaric  maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punknoir  
in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wont shut up  he impales a coworker  drowns another and so on  
but why  
his character is introduced as a smug genius  the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear  sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place  though once the character becomes invisible  this film has him pull a  shift into a psychotic movie monster  
the kind who just wont die  
hollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda  elizabeth shue  acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm  and her lover  a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin whos saddled with the films worst lines   ive lost cohesion again     
theyre a typical aaron spelling couple  goodlooking but as vacant as george w  bushs republican national convention speech  i  e  
bush referring to clinton      so much promise    but to what end  
to what end    
this actually got applause  
suddenly warren beatty doesnt look so absurd   
the rest of the films characters are all well past thirty  though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained oneliners  is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique  
ahh  what a cynical time we live in    
as the picture opens we meet cain  kevin bacon   an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret  so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations  project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility  for what purpose is never hinted at   
theyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine  in a twist worthy of the films s late show origins  to impulsively experiment on himself  
caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his coworkers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead  
our mad scientist is turned invisible  after several fxheavy complications   then he inexplicably  its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures  but this is never explored  and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human   
begins raping  assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases  always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger  
it grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow  
like the rest  this one is cold  heartless  and full of contempt for humanity  but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit  insight and makes no statement other than  audiences will pay for anything these days   
its an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level  or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun  thrillaminute ride  
verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care  
the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick  
how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self  
a couple weeks ago  after seeing the trailer  a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability  
hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa  in a serious manner to boot  
but oh yeah  it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway  
verhoeven delivers the sleazy  goods   but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner  here it just feels icky and uncomfortable  
the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses  caressing their breasts with his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background  
its plainly obvious that verhoeven isnt exploring voyeurism  like in the classic peeping tom  but exploiting it and not even doing that very well  
its funny that with all the technology  million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand  
most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks  
in fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since  by the end  most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat  
as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov  a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre   and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked  
the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy  
it happens when a lab assistant  kim dickens  who looks like she stepped out of playboy  in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon  suddenly pauses  
  are you looking at me    she queries  obviously haunted  
its a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by   the apex of the mad slasher craze   
those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer  
and theyre the only reason to check out hollow man  preferably as a midweek bargain rental  
youve been warned  
but you probably wont listen  will you  
tis a pity
