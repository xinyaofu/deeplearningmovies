  tarzan and the lost city  is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while  
not only it is poorly written  badly acted  and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas  it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid  
unfortunately  its not bad in the way great  colossal misfires like  heavens gate     or  ishtar     were bad  
instead  it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with  which begs the question of why it was made in the first place  
with all the good scripts lying around hollywood unproduced  how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen  
of course  tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history  he has appeared in over forty films  which have ranged from the very good  s  greystoke  the legend of tarzan  lord of the apes   down to the really bad  s  tarzan  the ape man  with bo derek   
most of these films were just cheapie bmovies made in the thirties and forties  starring exolympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps  
therefore  if another tarzan movie is to be made  one might assume that it would have something new to offer  a different angle  an original storyline  anything to set it apart from all the others  
  greystoke  added a neverbeforeseen level of realism to the pulpy tale  and even  tarzan  the ape man  at least had the misguided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo dereks bare breasts  
  tarzan and the lost city   on the other hand  has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue  
the script  by bayard johnson and j  anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come  
comic books have better plots than this  
the movie is so bad  in fact  that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summers comedy  george of the jungle   
didnt the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs  
the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established  a quick opening narration tells of tarzan  casper van dien  being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes  and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage  
when the movie starts in   he is a civilized english gentleman  without an english accent   and he is to marry jane  jane march  in less than a week  
however  when a wicked archeologistgraverobber named nigel ravens  steve waddington  begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar  one of africas last great secrets  the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle  
at first  jane refuses to go  pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding  but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down  therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her apeman  
once the film gets going  in its own sluggish way   it delves into a series of jungle adventures  as tarzan  jane  and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city  
most of the socalled adventures are cheesy  predictable  and unexciting  with no pace  tension  or action to speak of  
there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies  ranging from  raiders of the lost ark     to  the goonies      
when the movie is running short on action  it includes a few greenpeacefriendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals  releasing a baby elephant from a trap  and throwing ivory tusks into the river  
the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality  
for instance  when tarzan  who was raised in the jungle  is bit by a cobra  he doesnt even attempt to suck the venom out like any semiexperienced weekend backpacker would do  
instead  he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival  
of course  one cant help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is  
not to ruin the ending or anything  but there is no lost city  
there is  however  a lost pyramid  which i suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up with  the special effects are not worthy of a madefortv movie   
which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid  when its sitting right out in the middle of an open field  
strictly speaking   tarzan and the lost city  isnt even bad enough to have camp quality  although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close  
this movie proves what  starship troopers  only hinted at  he cannot act  but he sure looks wellgroomed  even in the deepest heart of the african jungle  
van dien is much too much of a prettyboy to be an effective tarzan  hes a calvin klein model in a loin cloth  
i also wondered what the makeup department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa steve perry haircut  
waddington makes a decent villain  although hes like a charmless version of belloq from  raiders of the lost ark   as jane  the exmodel jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan  
she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two  but whenever a snake comes into the picture  she is reduced to a hysterical mess  
however  amidst all this complaining  i do have one piece of good news  
  tarzan and the lost city  is so lacking in ideas both new and old  that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid  
so  we can say this much for it  at least it had the decency to be short
