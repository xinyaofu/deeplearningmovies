how could a grated disney film based on meg cabots novel  the princess diaries  be anything but cute  harmless fun  
easy  
take all the cute  harmless fun out of it  
and while youre at it make it borrrring  
thats what director garry marshall  screenwriter gina wendkos and  not to be outdone  producer whitney houston have done with the grated disney film  the princess diaries   
you couldnt tell it from the audience though  a braintree  mass  of growing  glowing prepubescent girls  and the odd parental  popcorn perched about their persons   who positively cheered when the end credits rolled  ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddyduddy old me   
well  i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over  but that would have been too obvious  
too obvious is the least of the problems with marshalls film  garry made a couple of other  princess  movies  pretty woman  and  runaway bride  but this ones way without julia roberts so maybe  thats  its problem   
in addition to being predictable as molasses   the princess diaries  has hardly got a laugh in it  its a comedy   could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long  long stretches  and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we havent even seen yet  and probably never will except  perhaps  in the dvd edition   
marshall should take virtually all of the blame here  since hes been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isnt working    
and hardly  any  of  the princess diaries  works   works   alas  implies cleverness and theres none of that here either   
newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis  a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom  a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall  had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of  the filmmakers go out of their way  not  to call it serbia  which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words  and now she  mia  is next in line to rule  genovia   hence the headphonestiara combo in the print ads   
julie andrews  with the luminous factor cranked to   plays mias grandmother  aka queen clarisse renaldi   who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating  talking  and looking like a princess department  although mias big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan   
does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh  
not really  
consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets  
also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock  an evil cheerleader  a dorkylooking best friend   welcome to the dollhouse  s heather matarazzo   a sensitive auto mechanicmusician  and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver  imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mias chauffeurdriven limousine at every intersection  
a nonanimated grated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts  all the good stuff  has been exorcised from the finished product  
lame  labored  and lamentable   the princess diaries  is recommended for eightandahalf year olds of the feminine persuasion  only   all others would do well to avoid it  like potholes  the plague  and  the perfect storm
