the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet  vulnerable  irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness  
the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo  played by sookyin lee  as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible  
alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene  
this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland  
one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa  
she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window  
next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild  adam beach   
he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating  
ben gets emotionally involved with alessa  
  as alessa so delicately puts it   we were bosom buddies  now were fuck buddies    
but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor  
the real problem with the film seems to be helen lees inability to decide what she wants to be saying  
she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa  
alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients  
this appears to be a high profile and wellpaid job  
we are supposed to care about alessas feelings  but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father  
alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint  
this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up doublezero  
i rate it a  on the  to  scale and a  on the  to  scale
