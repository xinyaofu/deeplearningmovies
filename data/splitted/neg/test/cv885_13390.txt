director doug ellins kissing a fool  released earlier this year  is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story  
like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it  the movie meanders along insulting the viewers intelligence in almost every frame  
the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines youve heard before  
   im not wearing any underwear   the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster  max  in what she assumes will be a surefire comeon line   
max  chicagos biggest playboy  decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam  short for samantha  
max and sam possess two irritating personalities  and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience  
max is played without any style by david schwimmer  
schwimmer  whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality  makes an unlikely lover  
his costar  mili avital as sam  is cut from the same cloth  so they can be argued to be a matched pair  
after all  people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other  ditto for similar looks  so why shouldnt the personalitychallenged be attracted  
the implausible plot has max asking his best friend  jay  jason lee   to hit on sam as a test  
jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him  but stop short of the actual act  
max  being promiscuous by nature  worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does  
the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work  
neither the script nor the actors make this test believable  
  the    question is  how do you know youre with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life   
jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film  
finally  there is the films attempt at physical comedy  
jays exgirlfriend natasha  vanessa angel  becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else  
natasha rips jays shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa  
as she throws her hair on his bare chest  she demands he pull it  
this is supposed to be funny  
most films have some saving grace  
some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasnt  
kissing a fool  on the other hand  has nothing to recommend it  
kissing a fool runs     
it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers
