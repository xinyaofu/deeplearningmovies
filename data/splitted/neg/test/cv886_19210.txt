i am continually amazed at movies like this  
that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mindboggeling  but it seems to happen a lot nowadays  
  wild wild west  is a beautifully filmed  well acted  and well directed piece of garbage  and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault  
in short  this movie is a comedy without laughs  
so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal  
the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco  but its still pretty boring  
will smith stars as jim west  an old western  rb variation of the james bond character  
west is teamed up with artemus gordon  kevin kline   and theyre pretty much polar oppisites  west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets  gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach  
talk about deeply developed characters  
at any rate  this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies  none of which are funny  
the year is   
several top scientists have been abducted  and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general  bloodbath mcgrath  ted levine   
president grant sends west and gordon to investigate  
theres evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana  
west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr  arliss loveless  kenneth branagh   another disgruntled former confederate  
as it turns out  loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon  which he will use to conquer the united states  
id go further with the plot  but there isnt any point  
this films narrative is little more than a jumbled  unfunny mess  
i only laughed at a couple of jokes  and then only lightly  
there isnt one truly uprorously funny moment in this film  and thats pretty disasterous when you consider that its primarily a comedy  
as i said  the fault is totally that of the script  
when you consider their respective roles  will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done  
the leads couldve been played samuel l  jackson and robert de niro and the film still wouldve been awful  
no one  and i mean no one  can make a line like  bye bye  mr  knife guy   
sound good  
still  this film has a lot going for it visually  
the set design is fantastic  maybe even oscar worthy  
the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus  who was also behind camera in martin scorseses brilliant  goodfellas    is absolutely stunning  
he lends the film a much needed exciting  comic bookish look  
i wont fault barry sonnenfeld either  
he does a fine job of directing the proceedings  but  like the rest of the people involved with the film  there really isnt anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw  
despite being beautifully made   wild wild west  becomes quite boring after the halfway point  
the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does  
if  wild wild west  didnt look so good  it would be almost insufferable  
as it is  its somewhat tolerable  but not very entertaining  
it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low  but there isnt anything much worse than an unfunny comedy
