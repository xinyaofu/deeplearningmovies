spoiled rich kid kelley morse  chris klein  receives a new mercedes for a graduation present  
he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town  where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because hes rich and theyre not  
he ends up provoking jasper  josh hartnett  into a race and as a result  the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it  
kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner  and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his familys barn  
jaspers girlfriend sam  leelee sobieski  soon takes a liking to kelley however  despite the fact that   it was her familys diner that was destroyed and b  all kelley does is sit around  sulk  and smart off to the townspeople  
but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless  thats apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper  whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair   
so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley  especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech  which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people   
in the speech  kelley quotes a poem by robert frost  which just so happens to be sams favorite poem as well  
awwwww  
soon theyre frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town  especially jaspers best friend  see them together  
kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town  especially when he shows up at the town dance  drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper  
kelley runs off and decides to leave town  
sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him  
jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her  and sam  without even breaking stride basically says  see ya   
and takes off to boston with kelley  
here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around  its completely worthless  
chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers  and its because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place  
however  not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both  
i shouldnt have such feelings towards people i like  but their characters are so infuriating that    
well trust me  youll feel the same way  
even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong  kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two  simply because his jerkish actions are calculated  
he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it  
jasper on the other hand  only reacts to kelleys provocations  and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions  
but  as in life  nice guys finish last  
for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the films only sympathetic character gets completely crushed  
then  a cancer subplot comes into play  where things get even more infuriating  if you can imagine that   
what  things werent depressing enough for you mr  screenwriter  
who greenlit this project  
who  on earth  thought this would entertain anyone  
perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people  
but even after hes destroyed these peoples lives he continues to be a snob to them  and ruins one more for good measure  
here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment  
it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of      and is enhanced for x televisions  
extras include jessica simpsons music video for  where you are   a commercial for the films soundtrack  which by the way is the only good thing about the film   the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots  trailers for other fox releases  anna and the king  anywhere but here  the beach  drive me crazy  ever after  romeo  juliet  simply irresistible   as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy  
the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine    
nothing that will challenge anyones audiovideo systems of course  
fans of this movie  if any exist  should enjoy the dvd release  
here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling  
no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film  
it is merely a waste of time  money and talent
