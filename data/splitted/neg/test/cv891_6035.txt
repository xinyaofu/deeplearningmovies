depending on your degree of cinematic acumen  last man standing is either a  a prohibitionera remake of akira kurosawas  classic yojimbo  b  a prohibitionera remake of sergio leones  classic a fistful of dollars  c  a prohibitionera action drama with a completely original storyline  
new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category  c  than in the other two combined  much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons  
the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing  which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the real source material  the dashiell hammett novel red harvest  
it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself  
this time around  the man with no name is played by bruce willis  a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico  
by all appearances  jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town  with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border  
one is headed by an irishman named doyle  david patrick kelly   the other is run by chicagoconnected italian mobster strozzi  ned eisenberg   
calling himself john smith  the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict  and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyles side  
but smiths allegiance is as uncertain as his name  and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them  
viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint  and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakescumbastardizations  
there is the happily ineffectual lawman  bruce dern   the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections  karina lombard   the barkeep who becomes our antiheros only friend  william sanderson   suspicious lieutenants  christopher walken and michael imperioli  to question the bosses trust in smith  a brutal beating  and a big fire  
director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids  including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity  but at least he doesnt try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture  
what he does do is nearly as big a mistake  and that is to provide a running voiceover narration by willis which rings of the standard hardboiled style of pulp detective fiction  
yes  that narration is full of cliches  but those are are not particularly troubling  
the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters  
they were a mystery  to the other characters in the film and to the audience  their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted  and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status  
with john smiths voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought  he becomes more mundane  just another tough guy trying to stay alive  
it feels like a hammett novel  all right  and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice  but it simply doesnt work  
the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence  and the man with no name takes no one into his confidence  
even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate  i cant imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction  
willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith  but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else  
christopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of softspoken psychos  and there isnt another single character whom makes even the slightest impression  
with no compelling antagonist for smith  there is no buildup towards the expected showdown  and when it does come  that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about  
cinematographer lloyd ahern  who also did the only noteworthy work on hills  flop wild bill  creates some nifty sunburned vistas  but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counterproductive narration  
sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original  theyll wonder what all the talk was about  
in the case of last man standing  it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about
