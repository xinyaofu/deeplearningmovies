synopsis  a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar  
the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary  while his wife disapproves  
meanwhile  a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession  
comments  why is this movie called possessed by the night  
its hard to speculate  
most of this film takes place during the day  and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky  pulsating  bubbling brain thingie in a jar  
in case you havent picked up on this yet  possessed by the night is a bottomofthebarrel  thriller   i use the term  thriller  loosely here  which is really cheap and bad  
the plot  which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the s  actually serves one purpose  to exploit nude women as often as possible  
writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging  
theres really not much to say  
the acting is lousy  although  occasionally  the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience  
most humorous is frank sivero  who plays murray  the novelists agent  
he is so horrible in this role that one cant help but be amused  
the plot sucks  
nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession  even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole  
the dialogue stinks  
a loan shark  for instance  tells another how much he loves bimbos  which is something the audience really doesnt need to know  
everything about possessed by the night is second rate  even the film credits  
as the names of the notsotalented film crew scrolled by at the end  joseph scales came up  credited as being  assistsant to foley artist   
someone could have used an editor  
to be honest  the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes  
playboy playmate shannon tweed  after all  is the star here  
i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing  he would like this movie  
why did i give this turkey two stars and not one  
as a bad movie  it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film  
if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night  however  id recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else
