there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do  
i delighted in the sneakysmart entertainment of ron underwoods bigundergroundworm yarn tremors  i even giggled at last years criticallysavaged bigunderwatersnake yarn anaconda  
something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth  spent in the company of ghidrah  the creature from the black lagoon and the blob  
deep rising  a bigunderseaserpent yarn  doesnt quite pass the test  
sure enough  all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place  a conspicuously multiethnicmultinational collection of bait    excuse 
me  characters  an isolated location  here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea  some comic relief  a few cgienhanced grossouts  and at least one big explosion  
there are toocheesytobeaccidental elements  like a sleazy shipping magnate  anthony heald  who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology  or a slinky international jewel thief  famke janssen  whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold  
as it happens  deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients  
a terrorist crew  led by squintyeyed mercenary hanover  wes studi  and piloted by squintyeyed boat captain finnegan  treat williams   shows up to loot the cruise ship  the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew  a few survivors make it to the closing credits  
and up go the lights  
its hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless filmmaking  especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream  
here  the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j  oconnor  generally amusing as the crews fraidycat mechanic  
writerdirector stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of actionhorror menace  something overpopulated with goredrenched skeletons  something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously  
deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that were expected to have a ridiculous good time  not hide our eyes  
case it point  comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda  
in deep rising  one of the creatures victims is regurgitated back into view  partially digested and still alive  
he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain  in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable  
in anaconda  we also see a regurgitated victim  partially digested and still alive  
he looks at another character    and 
winks  
make no mistake  deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing  
its also gloomy  uninspired and not nearly enough fun  
i dont ask much of my monster movies  but i do ask that they act like monster movies  
you dont have to show me a fantastically impressive  massive beast with tentacles aflailing  
just show me the massive beast burping  and ill figure you get the point
