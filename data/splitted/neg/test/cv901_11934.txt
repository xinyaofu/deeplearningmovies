renee zellweger stars as sonia  a young jewish wife and mother frustrated by the constraints of her hasidic community in brooklyn  
her husband  glenn fitzgerald  is a religious scholar whose allinadayswork attitude on sex fails to tame the  fire  she feels within  as so she confesses to the rebbe  after hearing her fiery confession  the rebbe suddenly gets frisky with his pleasantly surprised wifeand dies the next morning   
sensing her frustration  her husbands brother  christopher eccleston  gives her a job in his jewelry brokering business in exchange for raw  passionless sex that just fans sonias stillburning flame  
on the job  sonia befriends ramon  allen payne   a cool blast of hunky puerto rican water who does his own jewelry designs when not working as a grunt in an upscale jewelry store  
can firetaming be far be that far behind for the eversmoldering sonia  
just about everything in writerdirector boaz yakins rings false  starting with the improbably cast zellweger  who does an adequate enough acting job but simply looks too waspy for the role  
a better fit would have been julianna margulies  who outshines zellweger as sonias takenocrap sisterinlaw  
some of sonias baby steps toward liberation  such as indulging in a nonkosher egg roll in chinatown  come off as silly  
yakin attempts to spice up the proceedings with a touch of magical realismin the form of the recurring presence of sonias longdead brothers ghostmake the story feel even more trite than it already is  
  i didnt know what to expect  
its like something you chase for so long  but then you dont know how to react when you get it  
i still dont know how to react
