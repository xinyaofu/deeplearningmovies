therere so many things to criticize about i dont know where to start  
recommendation  turn off your brain  dont be like me  decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much  
a comet is about to strike earth  causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event  e  l  e   that wiped out the dinosaurs  
what follows is the story of a presidents bid to think for the good of his people  a rising reporter  the love story of two teenagers  one of whom discovered the comet   and a team of astronauts on the ship messiah to save the world  
firstly  there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film  nor is there anything outstandingly good about it   but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid  
to be honest  i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself  which isnt saying much   
mimi leders followup to the peacemaker is equally incompetent  with all the big stars wasted  
  perhaps im just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller  the assignment   
it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision  but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives  
however  the film simply fails on that note  
the effects are wornout  the substandard screenplay limited the acting  and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials  
shes still making good money though  
t  a leonis unfortunate character  the news reporter  is the foundation of the story and of the cast  
but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored  
robert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless  and morgan freemans president is restricted to  well  a righteous president  which means hes not interesting at all   
leonis character is the only appealing one  and is played with reasonable conviction  but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc   but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters  
warning  spoilers included  but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway   
plot holes  plot holes  plot holes  
now  e  l  e  
is threatening to exterminate more than  of the human race  and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there  
wheres the logic  
leder could have at least made it plausible with   
and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish  and those less selfish ones  the ones that stayed at home  were the victims  
the film was almost mocking them  telling them they had died for nothing  
i also fail to see how two teenagers  carrying a baby  would be the first to climb up the mountainhill  even with a motorbike for a headstart  
its unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle  but that doesnt really matter  
building caves was a strategy mentioned in dr  
strangelove  which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years  
now that is a more practical use for caves  
what is the point of living in caves  
there is no  unlike dr  
strangelove  any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure  
how do plants grow  
if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves  theres no reason why they cant do it in the open  
the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves  
obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago  and you cant be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media  
in an important mission like that of the messiah  for that matter any mission  it is impossible that isnt sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres  needless to say tens of kilometres  
this is not deep impact  its a frivolous cheap impact  
but even with all that  some overacting  and a    rating  its still watchable  just dont think about it  
okay
