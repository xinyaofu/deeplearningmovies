its a good thing most animated scifi movies come from japan  because  titan a  e   is proof that hollywood doesnt have a clue how to do it  
i dont know what this film is supposed to be about  
from what i can tell its about a young man named kale whos one of the last survivors of earth in the early st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and regenerating what is left of the human race  
thats a fine premise for an actionpacked scifi animated movie  but theres no payoff  
the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil  dredge  aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason  
so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights  fistfights  blaster fights and more doublecrosses than you can shake a stick at  
theres so much pointless scifi banter its too much to take  
the galaxy here is a total ripoff of the  star wars  universe the creators dont bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing  the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring  
despite the fantastic animation and special effects  its just not an interesting movie
