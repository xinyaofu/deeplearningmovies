woof  too bad that leap of faith was the title of a  comedy starring steve martin and debra winger  because thats whats required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis asof all thingsa psychologist  
not since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude  
alas  mickey rourke  we hardly knew ye  
story opens with a campy kickwillis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy  
she goes splat  he goes ugh  and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind  
really  
the good doctor then moves to sunny l  a   where he rooms with an old college chum  scott bakula   a therapist whos getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group  
buddy bites it in the second reel  no surprise there  and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats  
for his troubles as therapy man  willis gets to share some cutfromnc love scenes with the lovers jane march while dodging nails  cars  and rattlesnakes  
whyd it have to be snakes  
color of night is the worst movie of the year  
period  
forget north  clifford  or  heaven help us  even on deadly ground  
here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you cant help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming  
for starters  the  group  is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis  
these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy  
playing a prissy obsessivecompulsive  cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif  alone  may set the psychology profession back ten years  
the plots a wreck with laughable dialogue  pointless pov shifts  and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes  
director richard rush  who once helmed freebie and the bean  doesnt seem to mind  
unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations  he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany setpieces to make the effort almost worth watching  
his token freeway chase is ok  but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala  most recently  fatal analysis  
acting credits are acrosstheboard awful  
willis can be forgiven because hes filming die hard  as we speak  
but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop  
or lesley ann warrens stereotypical sex addict  
or worst offender jane march as a mysterygirlwhosnorealmystery  
shudder  
bottom line  how they all kept straight faces  ill never know
