theres only one presidential election every four years  but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as the thriller of the year  
in   weve had absolute power  air force one  shadow conspiracy and murder at   
this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford  trying to bring us a complex plot of coverup and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys  
heres what happens this time  
its night at the white house  
a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt  
the next day shes dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in  
how do we know hes a hotshot  
weve seen the traditional action flick opener  the clever hostage negotiation scene  
its not so clever this time  consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal exgovernment employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street  
snipes is off to the white house  where he finds the secret service head  the shiny bald head of daniel benzali  wont cooperate with him at all  
in fact  if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda  snipes wouldnt have been allowed in the white house at all  
alda helps snipes out further  assigning a sexy secret service agent  diane lane  to act as his liaison    
a very dangerous liaison  
well  not really  i just wanted to say that  
almost immediately  a suspect is found  an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos  
snipes doesnt buy it  and launches into an independent investigation of his own  one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the presidents son  
snipes partner  an always wisecracking dennis miller  calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane  who at first doesnt believe snipes  eventually and predictably comes around  and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information  
for the first hour or so  murder at  looks like it could be going somewhere interesting  
sure  we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that  but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon  
snipes and lane dont make for a bad action team  but with nothing to work with  theyre just cogs in the bad movie machine  
dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie  they waste his talents more in murder at  than they did in bordello of blood  and thats saying a lot  
when you get to the last halfhour  the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer  busting out the old breakintothebuilding underground climax  
and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why  youll wish you never sat through this movie at all  
the    in the movies title doesnt represent an address  it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide  
serving the world for nearly th of a century
