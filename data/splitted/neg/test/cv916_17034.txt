ah  and  was going along so well  too  
  shes all that  has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie ive seen so far this year  
and quite frankly  i doubt ill see anything equally bad  
  at least  i  hope  i dont see anything equally bad   
  shes all that  tells the story of the most popular guy in school  played by freddie prinze jr   who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school  rachel leigh cook  into the most popular  
that  right there  is problem   
how many times have we seen this storyline  
as cook comments near the end of the film   its kind of like  pretty woman   except without the prostitution   
of course  had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material  the wellworn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward  
as it is  though   shes all that  relies  completely  on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead  
theres not one original or interesting character in the film  either  and if that wasnt bad enough  theres not one good performance featured  
the star of the movie  rachel leigh cook  is simply horrible  
i usually dont like to get so personal  but in this case  i think it needs to be said  
cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was  
i was never convinced that she was a  nerd   and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary  
the movie seems to be saying its better to be popular than to be who you are  
as for freddie prinze jr   an actor i ordinarily enjoy  he too is quite bad here  
he coasts through the film on socalled charm  and never establishes a real character  
kieren culkin is here  too  as the brother of cook  
and for some indiscernable reason  hes got hearing aids  
no explanation is given and theyre never brought up  
were we supposed to feel  sorry  for him just because he wore hearing aids  
i dont think so  
that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things ive seen in a movie in a long time  
  shes all that  sucks  
thats what it boils down to  
its not entertaining  and its not even a good time passer  
the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a  minute hairremoval system informercial  
and whats worse  it sends out a bad message to teens  
it appears to be telling them   hey  it doesnt matter if youre happy the way you are  
thats unimportant  
if you want to  truly  be happy  dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubbleheaded moron   
ugh
