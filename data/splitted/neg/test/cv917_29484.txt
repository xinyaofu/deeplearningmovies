michael robbins hardball is quite the cinematic achievement  
in about two hours  we get a glancing examination of ghetto life  a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy  speeches about never giving up  a cache of cute kids  including a fat one with asthma   a hardluck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic  big game   where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined  
all thats needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich  s  
i cant wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd  
obviously  hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball  
it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler  who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam  
out of solutions  he begs his successful corporate friend  the always welcome mike mcglone  to lend him     
instead  mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend  
reeves  who wants to keep his fingers  accepts the offer  but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely  
the drowsyvoiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs  
and maybe  just maybe  theyll play in the big championship game  
one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins  summer catch   adapted from daniel coyles nonfiction book  is that there arent any  
the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie  
that wouldnt be so bad  if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them  
most of the kids time is spent yelling at each other  talking in slang and acting surprised  
theres little thats naturally amusing about them  as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling  
the worst of the lot is a toughtalking younger player  dewayne warren  whose sole purpose  as the movie unfolds  is being an emotional pawn  a tactic so utterly despicable i cant find the right words to express myself  
the adults also dont fare well  
reeves is impressively uninspiring as the downonhisluck loser  
the character is poorly written  but reeves gives another charismafree performance  
every time he speaks  he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up  
kids are supposed to rally around this guy  
diane lane  who costars as reeves obligatory love interest  remains a glowing screen presence  see my dog skip for better proof   
its too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like   these kids trust you  and they dont trust anyone   
then theres d  b  
sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters youve seen before and hope never to see again  
i wanted hardball to be good  
robbins varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved  
i havent seen robbins goofy ready to rumble in its entirety  but i am intrigued that  macho man  randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions  
robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte  making sports movies for guys and not cutesy  cuddly pap such as hardball  which also manages to annoy and insult the audience  
heres hoping that happens in the immediate future
