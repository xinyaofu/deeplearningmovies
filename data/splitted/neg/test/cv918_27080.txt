you know something  christmas is not about presents  
its about overhyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tieins  
at least that would seem to be the message of  the grinch   which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores  
hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season  
you know the plot  theres this evil furry green guy called the grinch  jim carrey  who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville  
down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation  but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas  
the movie is  of course  a liveaction version of the beloved childrens book  which was previously adapted into a  tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones  
its rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirtyyearold halfhour cartoon  but thats the case when jones version is compared to ron howards  
the tv grinch hit all the right notes  boris karloffs soft  deep narration  thurl ravenscroft singing  mr  grinch   max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head  and the grinchs wide  toothless grin  
by contrast  the movie hits one sour note after another  
first  there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a minute movie  
young wideeyed cindy lou who  taylor momsen  is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents  bill irwin and molly shannon  during the holiday season  
she begins to sympathize with the grinch  who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic  
cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class  martha may whovier  played as an adult by christine baranski   
are we expected to like the grinch  hate the whos  and want him to steal christmas  
the grinch isnt even the villain here  that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville  jeffrey tambor  who was the grinchs rival for marthas affection  
not only are the characters needlessly complex  but the oncesimple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought  
the casting choices arent any better than the screenwriting decisions  
jim carrey seems woefully miscast  
while his face is so supple that the rubber makeup seems superfluous  carrey brings nothing else to the role  
his accent keeps changing  i assume he was shooting for karloff  but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon  sean connery  and cartman from  south park   
not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinchs home  carrey falls back on his standup comedy and clowns around ace venturastyle  
needless to say  his wisecracking antics dont quite fit the character of the grinch  who is an embittered loner filled with hate  
little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile  
she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story  finding  santa  in her living room stealing the tree   
however  the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch  and momsen is not up to the challenge  
bottom line  when youre stealing christmas  movies   leave this one behind
