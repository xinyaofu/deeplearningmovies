susan grangers review of  the musketeer   universal pictures  
hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this  million adaptation of alexandre dumass novel thats strong on action but weak on drama  fusing hong kong martial arts with th century swordplay  
the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing dartagnan  justin chambers  as he leaves his village of gascogne  headed for paris  to join king louis xiiis elite guard  the royal musketeers  and to search for the man who killed his parents  years earlier  
this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre  tim roth   vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu  stephen rea   
the traditional musketeer trio  aramis  nick moran   athos  jan gregor kremp  and porthos  steve speirs   dont offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca  mena suvari   chambermaid to the queen of france  catherine deneuve   
scripter gene quintano and directorcinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derringdo  as evidenced by choreographer xinxin xiongs elaborate  but not original  stunts  including a fastpaced stagecoach chase  a tavern brawl on rolling barrels  highwire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes  and a ladderfight sequence  
filmed in southern france  the scenery  sets and costumes are spectacular  but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy  restless mtvish cuts  
as the swashbuckling dartagnan  bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing  totally lacking onscreen charisma  not to mention acting skill  
mena suvari  so impressive in  american beauty   seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    the musketeer  is a cinematic but shallow   
  all for one and one for all   
not this time round
