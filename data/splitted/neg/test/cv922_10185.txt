stallone attempts to act in this cop drama  
the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal  whos nephew  played by michael rappaport  is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths  
keital dosent really want to get involved in anything  gets rid of rappaport  and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on  
this film should be brilliant  
it sounds like a great plot  the actors are first grade  and the supporting cast is good aswell  and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance  
however  it cant hold up  
although the acting is fantastic  even stallone isnt bad  the directing and story is dull and long winded 
some scenes go on for too long  with nothing really happening in them  
in fact  the only scenes that do work are action scenes  which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid  
in this film  serious means dull  
the dialogue is warbling  and basically just repeats the same points over and over  no matter who is delivering them  
the plot  which has potential  is wasted  again just being cliched after a while  
in fact  the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro  both delivering their usual good performances  
however  stallone  although not given much to say  gives a good performance  
however  its not all that bad  
as said above  the action scenes are well done  
theres also a very good ending  which uses the cinemas sound system well  
in fact  the last  minutes of this  hour film are one of the best endings of   
if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending  
cop land  then  turns out not to be a power house film  but a rather dull  and not every exciting film  
hugely disappointing  and i cant really recommend it
