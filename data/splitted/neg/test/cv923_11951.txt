the first species was a moderatelysuccessful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects  a few well paced action sequences  and frequent views of modelturnedactress natasha henstridge sans clothing  
however  it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel  
and  considering the quality of species   its obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead  
the only thing that distinguishes species  is how awful it is  
if you throw away the plot  which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence  logic  coherence  and consistency  species  actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience  
of course  that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys  who  at least in theory  shouldnt be able to get into an  r  rated film  and connoisseurs of bad movies  
theres enough blood  gore  simulated sex  and bare flesh in species  to prevent it from ever becoming boring  
this is a grade z exploitation flick thats ripe for the mystery science theater  treatment  
somewhere  someplace  i recall hearing species  described as  erotic   
i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie  because he  or she  has a peculiar notion of eroticism  
sure  theres a lot of sex and nudity  but its almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a womans abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free  splattering blood and gore in all directions  
anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater  
i suppose the main attraction in species  is natasha henstridge  and  to get the obvious question out of the way  yes  she does remove her top  but only once  and only briefly   
although the character she played in the original species is dead  government scientists still have the dna  and  out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse  they decide to create another clone  
this creature  dubbed  eve  by its creator  dr  laura baker  played by marg helgenberger  reprising her role   is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile  
meanwhile  man has finally set foot on mars  
a team of three  led by patrick ross  justin lazard   has traveled to the red planet  but when they return to earth  they bring something with them  
ross has become a halfhumanhalfalien hybrid  and hes soon mating like crazy  collecting the bloodsoaked children that are the result of each sex session  
his intention is obviously world domination  
standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film  preston lennox  michael madsen   and one of patricks fellow astronauts  dennis gamble  mykelti williamson   
but when patrick learns about eve  a female of his kind  theres no damping his ardor  
im not sure what the budget for species  was  but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors  as opposed to being diverted into the special effects   
michael madsen and marg helgenberger  both back for a second round  are clearly on hand to do as little as they can  grab the money  and run  
ditto for james cromwell  who plays patricks father   underused  is too kind a word to describe his involvement   invisible  would be more like it   
george dzundza gets to do a little scenery chewing as an angrybutinept general  
meanwhile  justin lazards performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridges limited abilities look good by comparison  
the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson  who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick  
complete with cheesy special effects  bare breasts around every narrative corner  and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter  species  has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics  
director peter medak  a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume  has added another forgettable title  but at least he appears to have had fun doing it  which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness  
do i recommend the movie  
absolutely not  but i will admit that species  is dopey enough that it didnt try my patience to the degree that some pseudointellectual bad movies do  
heres hoping theres no species
