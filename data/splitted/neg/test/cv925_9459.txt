everybody in this films thinking of alicia  
no  this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the  cryin  video  
this is one of those erotic thrillers  but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed  
first off  theres zero sex  almost no nudity  and its not as wellplotted as one of those tweed flicks  
well  anyway  
the  plot   
alicia plays  well  the babysitter  who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents  j  t  
walsh and lee garlington  go out to a party  
the film  trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers  shows every characters thoughts  except alicias  
the thing is alicias in most of them in most cases  and the thoughts arent too kosher  
first off  theres her boyfriend  jeremy london  who gave one of the alltime lousy performances in  mallrats   and is only a notch better here   whos a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully  played by nicky katt from  suburbia   who shows hes got that quiet creepiness down pat once again   
they decide they want to crash her babysitting job  looking for the typical babysitting hankypanky  
somethine like that  
the film intercuts between the subplots  alicia babysitting  nicky and jeremy  the party  and each characters thoughts  
we get to see jeremy and nickys dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia  j  t  
thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub  she has it all covered up  the little tease   and  worst of all  lee garlington dreaming of that hunk  george segal  
it even shows them in bed together  
yea  
i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed  though i guess im used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in  flirting with disaster   
the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing  but come on  
like we care about any of the characters  
the only interesting one is alicia  mainly because shes alicia  and we mostly see her in the fantasies  
so i guess shes some kind of mystery or something  
but she is never explored further  
so  basically  this film is just a series of mastabatory images  sometimes featuring a nonnude alicia  once again  sadly   sometimes featuring a scantilyclad george segal  once again  sadly   
i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night  and let me tell you  it is the only way to watch this film  
i mean  theres a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night  theyre just as good as sleeping pills  
and this one is one big fat waste of time  even for an alicia film
