a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  
ive attempted to obey this rule in recent months  but to do so would be impossible in this case  
the fact is  nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  
for me  they calibrated my creativity as a child  they are masterful  original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time  and they still hold up pretty darn well   
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release  but that doesnt make me any less dedicated to it  
on the contrary  the star wars trilogy  and the empire strikes back in particular  are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series  i got exited  
when i first saw screenshots from the film  well over a year ago  i embarked on a yearlong drool of anticipation  
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving  i was ready to see the film  
but then there was the hype  the insane marketing campaign  and lucasfilms secretive snobbery over the picture  
in the last weeks before the picture opened  while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater  i was tired of hearing about it  
i was tired of seeing cardboard cutouts of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell  
i just wanted to see the movie  
reader  do not misunderstand  
i did not have an antihype reaction  
the hype was unavoidable  
i understand and accept the hype  its just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released  
five minutes into the phantom menace  i knew there was a problem  
  who are these jedi knights   
i asked  
  why are they churning out stale dialogue with machinegun rapidity   
  why arent these characters being developed before their adventures   
  why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film   
these were just some of my questions early on  
later  i asked   wheres the magic of the first three films   
and  why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes   
by the end of the film  i was tired  maddened  and depressed  
george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless  mindless  summer blockbuster  
the phantom menace is no star wars film  
take away the title and the jedi talk and the force  and youre left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  
its an embarrassment  
i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored  or a new theme is examined  or a special effects shot isnt used  
there are a few of each  but theyre all token attempts  
the fact is  george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects  
this is not what i wanted to see  
i didnt want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth  but i did  
the story centers mostly around quigon jinn  liam neeson  looking lost and confused  and his apprentice  obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  who scarcely has a line in the film  and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo  
naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation  their contact on naboo is queen amidala  natalie portman   the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people  
after picking up jar jar binks  a completely cgi character  voiced by ahmed best   they head to tatooine  where they meet young anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  and his mother  pernilla august   
quigon knows that the force is strong with young anakin  and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys  
the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious  neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters  
there isnt anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form  
the way lucas has handled it  however  it unsatisfactory  
first of all  we dont learn one single thing about quigon jinn  
not one thing  
what was his life like before this film  
well  i imagine he didnt have one  
thats why he feels like a plot device  
this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role  and why hes recently retired from film  i dont blame him  honestly   
obiwan  a character i was really looking forward to learning more about  is even less interesting  
mcgregor has just a few lines  so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere  
since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace  lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie  
things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine  young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshedout character in the film  and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role  
i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene  rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting  
and when anakin says goodbye to his mother  i found it moving  
also fairly good is portman  and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written  
jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ive ever had to endure  but hes more interesting than most of the humans  
as soon as the relativelybrief segment on tatooine is over  its back to the mindnumbing special effects and depthless action scenes  
ive seen many movies that qualify as  special effects extravaganzas   but the phantom menace is the first one ive seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie  
the reason is obvious  george lucas has no restraint  
i cant say that i didnt find the effects original  because i did  the final battle between darth maul  obiwan  and quigon is visually exceptional  as is most of the film  
but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome  
my breaking point was near the end of the picture  as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters  in the background  we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky  and i wanted that to go away  
cant we have one stinking scene that isnt bursting at the seems with a special effects shot  
i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours  
and then theres the question of magic  
what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi  
i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel  
john williams familiar score is no help  nor is lucas direction  
i think it comes right down to characters  there are none here  
i longed for the magnetic presence of han  luke  and leia  but i got no such thing  
and what about the ridiculous expectations  
mine werent that high  i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving  a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects  
instead  i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show  
i dont hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it  id like to forget that it exists  and yet i cant  
its here to stay  
i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them  because if they dont  then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series
