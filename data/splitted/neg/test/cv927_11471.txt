the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic  
finding an allstar cast for such a film is a stroke of genius  
combining all that with a threetime oscarwinning director  robert benton of  kramer vs  
kramer   and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment  
in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood  how many of these have we seen during the past few years  
 the atmosphere is moody  the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere  
over harry ross  paul newman  is a washed up copturnedprivate eyeturned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life  
hes screwed up things pretty well   i had a wife and daughter  
now  im a drunk  and is at a crossroads  
a couple of years ago  he traveled to mexico to bring back mel  reese witherspoon   the underage daughter of jack  gene hackman  and catherine  susan sarandon  ames and now lives with them  
the ames are former movie stars  past their prime and the three have become fast friends  
one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up  
to fill his time  he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine  
jack is in even worse shape than harry  
hes dying of cancer with only a year to live  
things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him  
instead of the routine errand that ross expects  he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another excop who is  himself  full of bloody holes  
this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherines first husband  years before  
through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder  blackmail  guns  mels mexico traveling partner and his parole officer  rosss former cop buddies  exlover and wouldbe sidekick  the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to  
its a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale  but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about  
the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario  
by the time they show you  it doesnt matter  
the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in rosss relationship with rubin  giancarlo esposito   a partner wannabe  
these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief  however they are neither  
rubin and ross have some past relationship but either its not explained or i didnt care enough at that point to remember  
a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform  
its also not funny  doesnt connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course  
on the positive side  its often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen  
the three leads all have welldeserved academy awards and turn in accomplished  if not extraordinary jobs  
newman is a grand actor  but doesnt seem quite suited to the dark film style  
he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out  
hackman  also lowkey  is believable but lacks sparkle  
sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is onedimensional  
the actors do what they can with lame dialog  but they cant pull the film out of the hole its dug for itself  
james garner who plays rosss old buddy excop raymond hope is always a treat  but even he halfheartedly struggles through lines like  im glad they didnt shoot your pecker off   
the best part of the film is the look at old friends  how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make  
the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen 
the film doesnt run very long before the audience realizes that its hopeless  
the only reason for watching is the actors  
it reminds me of disaster movies such as  towering inferno  where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the films problems  
in a better world  there would have been secondrate actors in this secondrate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better  
of course  we dont live in that better world  but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie
