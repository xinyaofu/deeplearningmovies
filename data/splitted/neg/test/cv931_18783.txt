its a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it  
such is the case for the  paul mayersberg film the last samurai  
though the blurb alludes to  a jungle filled with political intrigue  uneasy alliances  and murderous enemies at every turn   the story of the movie is actually quite simple  and prosaic   a middleaged japanese businessman named endo  played by john fujioka  and his assistant  both of whom have samurai aspirations  travel to africa in search of his ancestor  who went to bring buddhism to africa  
he hires the services of downattheheels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo  the redoubtable lance henriksen  and his girlfriend  arabella holzbog   and travels to the camp of an armsmerchantcumsafarihost cumislamicmissionary  john saxon  and his wife  lisa eilbacher   
they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witchdoctor aspirations to conceal a prearranged arms deal  which subsequently falls through  
congo escapes  finds endos ancestors sword  and comes back  guns blazing  to free the rest of them  and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword  
the end  
the last samurai is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable  
it is merely there  
the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated  subplots that are never explained  and many scenes that make very little sense at all  
the film is shot through with all the tired old  inscrutable japanese samurai  and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie  
it is quite slowpaced  with only a bit of action near the end  and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic  
most of the acting is fair  with the possible exception of congos girlfriend  
lance henriksen is his usual scenechewing self  and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie  
the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery  
i paid  for this film  from the discount rack at best buy  and halfway suspect i overpaid for it  
if you are in the mood for samurai  read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie  
skip the last samurai unless you are a diehard henriksen fan
