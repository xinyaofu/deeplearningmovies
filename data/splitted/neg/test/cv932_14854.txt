birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives  
are we doing what we want to be doing  
what happened to our dreams  
with the new millennium  our collective big birthday  just around the corner  some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence  
the old standbys of traditional religion and science arent doing it for many anymore and theyre looking for something else  
well be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years  
ricky hayman  jeff goldblum  is having a career crisis  
the programming director for the good buy home shopping network  hes going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically  
new producer kate newell  kelly preston  is supposed to whip things into shape  
when the two are fixing a flat  they almost run down new age pilgrim  g   murphy   
g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they dont really want all that commercial crap  
in some unexplained manner  this causes sales to sour  
ricky is saved  
the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all  
its not an overthetop comedy or a heartwarming message of humanity  
it is a mishmosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog  
i am willing to put up with preaching from a film  but the messages here are old hat  
you should take time to smell the roses  
selling your soul for cash is a bad idea  
golly  
im glad i saw the movie  
i never would have thought of these  
the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed  
when g takes a chainsaw to the set  theres an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious  
it doesnt happen  
the bits are so subdued and overlylong that theres only a hint of laughter from the audience  
murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better  
there are hints of promise in this one  
the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shavedheaded character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen  
the others are horrendous  
goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career  but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his  invasion of the body snatchers   
his relationship with kate makes no sense  
they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen  
preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be  
somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value  
an attempt to satirize stupid television  we get a selfparody instead
