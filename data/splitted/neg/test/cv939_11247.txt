postchasing amy  a slew of lovetriangle movies  this month we have kissing a fool  costarring amys own lee  and april brings us the object of my affection  which may as well be titled chasing allan  for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate  
  to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it  that film stars schwimmers friend jennifer aniston   
if only kevin smith could write them all    
schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max  who falls in love with his best friend jay  lee  s book editor samantha  avital  a mere twentyfour hours after meeting her  
they are soon engaged  and max  because of his own raging libido  grows suspicious of samanthas fidelity  
he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book  to  test her   
the trouble is  jay might be secretly in love with her  
to stretch this flat  sitcom premise to feature length  the plot is framed by a climactic wedding  at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular talethe events leading up to the nuptialsto an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend  
hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film  schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue  and lee  poor lee  is miscast  
so hysterically funny in chasing amy  here he is forced to repress his comic instincts  to swear  to yell  to talk about oral sex    
the scripts idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a  sensitive man   and then show him drinking pepto bismol when hes stewing over his girl trouble  
as for avital  an israeli actress  she is warm and sweet  but we dont know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things  
she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer  who plays schwimmers assistant and personal temptress  turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo  
there are a handful  a smattering  of good scenes in kissing a fool  
i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club  during which jay gets up and asks  has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her   
over and over until hes booted off stage  
there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything thats on the page  
kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night jokemachine friends that spawned schwimmers movie career  so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back
