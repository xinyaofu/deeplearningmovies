yet another brainless teen flick  this one is about  surprise  drugs and sex  
stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldnt look more bored  
their characters are cardboard cutouts of every cliched teenager out there  
one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie  
everything about it annoyed the hell out of me  
the acting  and script  the plot  and ending  
the director  of the fluke hit swingers  could have very well directed a bunch of noname actors and had a watchabe film  
the  big  stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality  
i felt like i was watching dawsons creek episode   
although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast  
the  surprise  ending was sooo predictable  
since when is a male characters sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore   
go is dawsons creek  varsity blues  shes all that  go home and watch something else
