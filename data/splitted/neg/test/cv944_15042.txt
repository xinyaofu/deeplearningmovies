  it was not scary   
these are the first words that came to mind after it was over  
when a movie is called vampires   not scary  arent words that should be associated with it  
but that wasnt my only gripe  
john carpenter is a name associated with cuttingedge cinema  as in the intense scares of halloween  the thing and the prince of darkness  or the offbeat action of they live and escape from new york  
unfortunately  the only thing that is cutting edge about vampires is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach  
with an anemic plot and notquitekosher special effects  john carpenters vampires has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan  
the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers  led by james woods  of all people  
like some sort of holy ateam  they even have their own soupedup van   the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack  
their method is amusingly innovative  the bloodsuckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks  
to commemorate their victory  the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away  
their celebration is shortlived  however  as a master vampire named valek ambushes and singlehandedly destroys most of the team  
woods jack crow and buddy montoya  daniel baldwin  escape with their lives  along with a woman named katrina  sheryl lee   
although the woman has been bitten  montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire  
the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek  thomas ian griffith   a freaky marilyn mansontype whos on a mission that dates back  years  
along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau  tim guinee   a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl  
upham in saving private ryan  
some stuff happens in the middle of the movie  but i cant remember most of it  because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen  
vampires finally starts to pick up about  minutes into the mix  as crow  guiteau  and montoya assault an abandoned prisonturned vampire nest  
only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick  
but its too little too late  
we get the inevitable final confrontation  but it seems tacked on and rather anticlimactic  come on  were dealing with the master vampire here   
interestingly  last summers vampire actioner blade was derived from a comic book  and vampires from a novel  yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former  a more deliberate superhero flick  
woods jack crow spouts glib offthecuff oneliners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that ohsocool stride  
and his motive for killing vampires  
take a wild guess  
  hint  a  killed his  when he was just a    
at least blade had decent action and slick stylishness  
vampires lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamerthin plot  
to make up for this  the movie resorts to other  shocks   such as its generally condescending attitude towards women  crow slaps them around for the fun of it  and an overplayed contempt for religion  crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to  getting woodies    
it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie  
if not scary and gory  i wanted tense  relentless  and exhausting  
john carpenters vampires is none of these  
i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan  
for the rest of you looking for a good scare  beware  vampires is a film with no teeth
