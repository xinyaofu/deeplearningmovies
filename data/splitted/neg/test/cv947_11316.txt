what were they thinking  
nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough  but do we really need an eighties film  
robbie hart  adam sandler  used to want to be a rock and roll star  but in  hes singing at weddings and having a good time  
a romantic at heart  he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his highschool sweetie  
when she leaves him waiting at the altar  his tune changes to  love stinks   
he meets waitress julia  drew barrymore  who is engaged to a junkbonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together  
in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie  
sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role  but there is no spark  
barrymore doesnt seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it  beauty but no attitude  
both characters are just there  
bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show  
the eighties are shoved in our face  
references to deloreans  madonna   dallas   ivana and donald  burt and loni and  miami vice  get old fast  
the filmmakers must have realized that there wasnt much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions  
theyre not funny and it doesnt work  
with change on all fronts accelerating more and more  nostalgia appears to have a great appeal  but dont you think we could have more than  years before we yearn for the past  
maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino  
  michael redman has written this column for over  years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be
