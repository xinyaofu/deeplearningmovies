a new entry in the  revisionist history  genre of filmmaking  dick suggests that two nottoobright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nations biggest presidential scandal  
kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene  who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlenes watergate hotel room  accidentally stumble across g  gordon liddy  played deadon by harry shearer  and the infamous breakin  
when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip  they are ushered into a conference room  questioned as to what they know  and leave as official presidential dog walkers  
the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties  but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with  
when they discover that nixon  another deadon performance by dan hedaya  who actually favors nixon slightly  unlike anthony hopkins  has been abusive to checkers  the presidential dog  thanks to the conversations that he always recorded  they quit and become disillusioned  
during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein  events are set into motion that eventually lead to the presidents resignation  
this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry kingtype talk show  featuring a cameo by french stewart  about revealing the identity of  deep throat   
from there  we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad  dick  joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy  
at one point  the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial  
the band manages to stop right as dunst screams  you have to stop letting dick run your life   
much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot  
several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film  
if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault its juvenile bathroom humor  but its not  
the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audiences throat in the least subtle way possible  
i dont recall oliver stones nixon having to pander to its audience  but of course that film wasnt a comedy aimed squarely at a  yearold film going audience  
the only redeeming thing about this movie is its remarkable supporting cast  
i wanted to see more of ferrell and mccullochs woodward and bernstein  
those two characters are the sole basis for my rating  
i wish they had been given more screen time  but unfortunately  they are only relegated to the final halfhour  
their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight  especially mccullochs constant thwarting of ferrells attempts to gather information from the girls  who  in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat  so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsys brother   
the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters  but are given nothing to work with  
id like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities  
as for the two leads  dunst and williams can definitely do better  
they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele  the early years in this particular film  a highly dubious distinction at best  
stay through the first half of the end credits though  to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie  
an excellent idea marred by poor execution  dick could have been a great movie  
less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes  could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds  
as it stands though  dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as  dick and poopie  jokes  
and that  to me  does not make a funny movie
