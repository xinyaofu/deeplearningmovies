godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the  who cares about plot  summer movie  
a loose remake of the   classic  japanese monster movie  godzilla  king of the monsters  which is itself pretty thin in the story department   roland emmerich and dean devlins bigbudget lizardstompsmanhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind  
the script isnt just  dumbed down   its lobotomized  
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone  
presumably  the primary target group for this film is teenage boys  the demographic most likely to shell out  repeatedly to see the same images of monsterinstigated carnage  
thats not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction  theyre just not as readily susceptible  
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computergenerated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors  
stargate was a financial success  
independence day was a runaway hit  
and  with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tieins before it even opens  its virtually guaranteed at least  million  
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a nottooprecocious grade school kid  
godzilla isnt completely without merit  although it is close  
theres a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan  but it wears off quickly  
frankly  while the special effects are competent  theyre not all that stunning  
theres nothing new here  its jurassic park meets aliens  with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure  
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computergenerated visuals to the next level  
godzilla never really pushes the envelope  preferring to remain within a comfort zone  
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass  formulaic approach which disallows creativity  
  how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the st cannes film festival   
worst of all  godzilla isnt even exciting  
with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end  there isnt a sequence in this film that raises the pulse  
even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawnprovoking  
independence day may have been dumb  but it was full of  adrenaline moments  capable of getting the audience involved in the action  
in this aspect of its production  as in so many others  godzilla is lacking  
actually  part of the problem is that were never sure who were supposed to be rooting for  the green monster with an attitude or the paperthin humans trying to stop him  
the plot  such as it is  can be summed up rather simply  
after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands  godzilla shows up in the big apple  
he does some of the usual tourist things  stops by madison square garden  visits the chrysler building  goes on a walk through central park  and takes the subway  
in the process  he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs  but he never has trouble with traffic jams  
on hand to stop him is an elite u  s  army unit  led by a slightly lessarrogantthanusual military man  kevin dunn  and a biologist named nick tatopoulos  who has a theory about godzilla  
in his opinion  the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific  
in nicks words  godzilla is  a mutated aberration  an incipient creature  the first of its kind   
as luck would have it  nicks old girlfriend  audrey  maria pitillo   is a reporter based at a new york tv station  
along with her cameraman friend  animal  hank azaria   she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla  
then  just when the military has rejected nicks theory about why godzilla is in new york  a member of the french secret service  jean reno  recruits him for a special assignment  
instead of stomping around tokyo this time  godzilla has chosen new york city  
unfortunately  manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies  independence day  deep impact  armageddon  that its becoming boring  
the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong  but the big ape was only about  feet tall  
he could climb the empire state building  
at ten times that height  godzilla would be more likely to knock it over  
godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor  
theres an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sitcom material  an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nicks last name properly  and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel  
both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film   ebert   the mayor of new york  is played by michael lerner  and  gene   lorry goldman  is his campaign manager  
eberts reelection slogan is  not surprisingly   thumbs up for new york   
the siskelebert stuff is amusing the first time its used  but  after a while  it grows tiresome  
and  although the  characters  dont serve any real purpose  they keep popping up  
godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast  
this is largely because emmerich doesnt want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard  
thats not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno arent capable of good performances  both have done their share of solid acting in the past   but they arent alist names  
then again  considering the quality of the writing  even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine  
maria pitillo  dear god  plays the love interest and hank azaria  great expectations  is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief  
ultimately  it doesnt really matter what i  or any other critic  for that matter  have to say about the movie  
tristar has assumed that godzilla  like all selfproclaimed summer event motion pictures  is pretty much criticproof  
it may also be wordofmouthproof  
those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say  
so  when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time  its like spitting into the wind  
emmerich and devlin are master illusionists  waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors  
its probably too much to hope that some day  moviegoers will wake up and realize that theyve been had
