in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures  
of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person  
what may be a disastrous situation for one  may be seen as a challenge to another  
as deepak chopra is known to say   its not the ride  its the rider   
unfortunately clearthinking is not always the reaction to problems  
wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor  michael douglas  is a man with troubles  
hes sunk his money in illegal financial activities and its blown up in his face  
in a matter of days he will lose it all  
his wife emily  gwyneth paltrow  is a highlyplaced un interpreter and is not happy with her life either  
her marriage is cold and unfulfilling  
unknown to her  her new lover david shaw  viggo mortensen  is not only a painter  but an excon with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money  
emily is a prime target  shes worth over  million  
stevens solution to his predicament is to offer david half a million to kill his wife  
the artist accepts and the movie is underway  
drawing from frederick knotts play and loosely based on hitchcocks dial m for murder  this is alltoo typical of summer releases  
all style and no substance  
and theres really not much style  
director andrew davis  the accomplished witness and bestforgotten other films  has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn  
douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films  
mortensen showed promise in the past  
here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces  
the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman  
hes only onscreen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears  
the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense  
surprises are important  
in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen  
and nothing ever does  
nearly every event is telegraphed in advance  
closeup on this object or that action and its easy to guess whats going to happen  
as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile  
its a hopeless quest  
the story doesnt make much sense  
stevens wife is loaded  
even with unfriendly relations  youd think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her  
when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice  
if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife  would your first choice be her lover  
no matter how sleazy he is  i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity  
why would steven plan the murder as a breakin in their apartment  
why not just take her out as she was walking to davids loft in a bad neighborhood  
while deciding among the numerous summer films  you might do well to skip this one  
youll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel
