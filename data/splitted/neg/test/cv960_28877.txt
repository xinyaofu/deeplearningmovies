dr  alan grant  sam neill   jurassic park   is becoming disillusioned  
paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter  
his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up  
when the kirbys  william h  macy   fargo   tea leoni   the family man   ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna  the notorious site b of  the lost world   hes disdainful  but once they wave their checkbook  he reconsiders  
however the kirbys havent given dr  grant their real agenda in  jurassic park iii   
of course  we  the audience  have been tipped off  given that the film begins by showing us eric  trevor morgan   the patriot    a young boy  and ben  mark harelik   election   going for a paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry  and looks like cheesy rear projection   
grants established back home with a new right hand man  billy brennan  alessandro nivola   loves labours lost   on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds  
he also pays a visit to old flame dr  ellie sattler  laura dern   jurassic park    now married to another with a young son who calls grant the dinosaur man apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the films poorly imagined finale  
grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip  which is really an illegal gambit to save their son  that young paraglider  
the couple arent millionaires  making grants check bogus  and theyre separated as well  eric was with amandas new boyfriend  not that that makes much sense   meaning were in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining  
the kirbys hired hands  and obvious bait  are a threesome led by mr  udesky  michael jeter   the gift    
  didnt anyone consider that casting michael jeter and william h  macy together and not having them be related was a little odd   
as directed by joe johnston   october sky    jumanji    spielberg only produced this one  from a risible script by peter buchman and the  election  team of alexander payne  jim taylor   jurassic park iii  is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos  a spinosauraus  which goes head to head with the trex  and pteranodons   
the plot  as it were  is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks  
the effects are no longer new  and  as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson  rather murky looking at times  
film editing by robert dalva   october sky   was presumably done by machete  to keep this down to a  minute run time  
i know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors  then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes  
original music by don davis just repeats john williams original themes  
while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings  the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional  
  jurassic park iii  will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect  the same crowd who maybe liked  the lost world  jurassic park
