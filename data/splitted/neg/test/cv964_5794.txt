ever feel youre spending your whole life on the net  ouch    eating  breathing and excreting web sites  
that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net  
that you get your best sex on the net  
if firsttime director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers  he would  
as it is  he settles for characters talking on the phone  
denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation  where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone  
its a satire  and a sometimes funny one  about how we let handphones  callwaiting and answering machines run our lives  
the problem  denise calls up is a movie about an idea  
a darn good one  but still an  minutelong idea  
and despite salwens attempt at plots and subplots  despite some genuinely funny moments  you can predict the movies outcome within the first fifteen minutes  
you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldnt make it for a party  nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film  they would rather be talking on the phone  
heres salwens plot  while all the characters are in a dysfunctional  telefixated limbo  loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child  courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank  
as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the babys name  his friends  and his friends friends  get involved  courtesy of callwaiting and doublelines  
in the tigher and more tantalizing subplot  barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for  
both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet  but they get it going over the phone  
with repeated phone sex comes a glitch  what if the other person is simply faking it  
denise calls up scores with some inspired moments  
mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless  everyone shares the excitement of denises delivery through a conference call to her handphone  and barbaras best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friends answering machine  
  as gales overlychatty aunt recounts  her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain   
but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie  
the pace sags  the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephonetouters  
and the ending is literally a nonevent as expected  everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gales memory despite promising over the phone that they will  
we get the point  
the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terriblys statement until they have it coming out of your ears  
pun intended  
theres even a on the movies web site where you can win cellular phones  as if we havent had enough of these things already   
watch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
