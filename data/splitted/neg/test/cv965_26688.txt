  book  should have remained in shadows 
book of shadows  blair witch  
a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman 
certain things in our lives are inevitable  
death  sorrow  love  heartbreak  pain  joy  
we expect these events  
we know theyre going to happen and some  we even look forward to  
its part of the human condition  
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society  
as we near the fall election  several of them are hitting us in the face  
politicians exaggerate their own importance  
our side is always right  theirs is always wrong  
in the end  voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares  
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money  there will be a sequel  
even if the original story doesnt merit one  
even if the first film is complete in itself  
even if success is a fluke  
  the blair witch project  was made with a budget of    and exploded on the screen  raking in huge profits  
the concept was brilliant  
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real  
the film itself was even more convincing  
the movie must be authentic  
why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen  
the first film caught lightning in a bottle  
the sequel proves you cant pour that old lightning into a new bottle  
you have to give this effort some credit  
it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids  
it would have been easy  but of course  it wouldnt have worked  
instead  book of shadows  acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release  
its a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel  
unfortunately it doesnt work either  
five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film  
weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives  
even weirder stuff happens  
some people die  theres blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense  
while supposedly doing serious research  the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation  
then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud  very obnoxious heavy metal music  
its a bad plan  
the cast shows some early promise  
a couple is doing research on a  blair witch  book  
the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado  
a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief  
the obligatory hot babe is the  spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick  the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick  the cute wiccan chick  
the first films unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods  
this time  these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors  
theres not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason  
although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea  its ruined by poor execution  
the followup to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie  
theyre trapped in an old big weird house  
they stupidly separate into various rooms  
there are strange noises  they see scary apparitions and people disappear  
ever see this movie  
seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better  
the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore  
for a storyline filled with surprises  its oddly predicable  
  the blair witch project  was a rare triumph of style over substance  
  the book of shadows  is a triumph of tedium over promise
