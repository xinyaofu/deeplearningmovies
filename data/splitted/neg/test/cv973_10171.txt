in the continuation of warner brothers franchise  joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow  
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsmans screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as  the client  is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstones batgirl  who just happens to be alfreds niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife  dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure  and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little subplot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death  why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age  destroying all animal life  therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic  
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films  
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward  robin  bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure  constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships  while at the same time not really having any  
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him  
to say that his performance is workmanlike is to be generous  
his best performances are still on  e  r    
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend  played by elle macpherson   that it brings into question bruces latent homosexuality  
there is no spark and no passion  as there was for nicole kidmans psychologist in  batman forever   between bruce and anyone other than alfred  
and even that relationship is very reserved  
robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series  
now hes just a spoiled kid  
in  batman forever   burt ward wanted to be batmans partner and friend  
now  robin is suffering from ego deficiency  
robins attraction for poison ivy is not believable  except for a boy around the age of   
his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest  even though they are not related in a traditional sense  
chris odonnell  once considered a rising star  successfully burns up on reentry with this performance  
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking  
the less said about alicia silverstones performance the better  
this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film  
she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it  
this brings us to the villains  
arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday  
the most rediculous scene is during mr  freezes imprisonment  
the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film  
its almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member  
umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part  showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status  
her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in  sextette      
the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough  
these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film  
without going through the intricacies of the plot  there is one question that always comes to mind with this series  except for the first  batman    and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel  
mr  freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video  
every villain  even the minor ones  have to have a look  no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume  
with this film  warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to its tv incarnation  
the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows   
gwaaaas  and clangs associated with the old series  
you almost wonder if william dozier  producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film  
the special effects  by john dykstra  and production design  by barbara ling  are the primary stars of this film  
and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing  
every set  from ivys lair  the batcave  to freezes hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come  
there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film  
everything is set for maximum exposure  
the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have  
there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on  the time machine   the growing plant scene  but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured  
joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair  
camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series  
master shots pepper the action scenes  destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had  
mr  schumacher is a good director  
one just has to look back on the films  the lost boys    cousins   an underrated film  and  the client  to know that  
but  batman and robin  comes off as a mated made for tv movie  
the film has no style of individuality  
it is the cinematic equivalent to jello  pretty to look at  but empty  
it is unfortunate that this film  even with its surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warners thought tim burton would do with the franchise  
kill it  
joel schumachers  batman  robin  is loud  colorful  action packed  and ultimately   
boring  
stars
