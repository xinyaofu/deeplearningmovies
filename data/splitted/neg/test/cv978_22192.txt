anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landons fact based novel the king and i  and its big  expensive and soulless  
though goodlooking  its lavish sets  fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meersons script  
so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting  
this is jodie fosters first movie since the jawdroppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isnt the best choice to show off her acting chops  
shes trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens  the uptight  widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam  now thailand  with her son to instruct the kings  chow yunfat  son in the ways of the west  because  the ways of england are the ways of the world   
the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family   kids with  more in the way  impressive  no    
the eldest prince is none too happy about this   father  have i offended you in some way  
why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher    but soon gets to know anna and her stern motherwholovesyou personality better and comes to like her  
meanwhile  siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma  
the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britains doing which arouses suspicion in siam  putting anna in an uncomfortable position  
she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the kings prejudices  
he  though selfrighteous as ever  cant help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly  quietly  develop affections for each other  
there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the kings younger daughters dies  
its your classic deathbed scene  with the girls mournful eyes staring at her father  who tries only semi successfully to maintain his composure  
anna then comes in and cries a bit  
the sequence was there for a purpose  to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer  
im usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time  i was just sitting there  my emotions untouched  
this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren  
we never develop connections to the characters  never given a reason to care  
this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant  whose last film was ever after  one of my favorites of   
i do not doubt tennants ability to put together a decent movie  but anna and the king  aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient  
the sets and scenery are gorgeous  but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur  
even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from  million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia  
we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view  there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with largerthanlife awe  
i liked both foster and yunfat  who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles  
fosters generally stoic persona serves her well here  as she is playing a reserved  formal and rather underdeveloped character  
yunfat is especially effective  perfectly conveying the king of siams sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts  
what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations  
the cast is great  the director is talented  and the budget is lavish  but this illadvised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole  
this is an emotionless costume epic
