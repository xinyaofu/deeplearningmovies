this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be  one of the hottest writers in hollywood   
he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream     then added the successful i know what you did last summer      
script to his mix  and also created the popular tv series  dawsons creek   
so when he asked to direct his first movie  based on his first ever script written  everyone and their grandma said  sure  go for it    
uhhm  my question is    did anyone bother reading this stupid script    
plot  ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west  mrs  tingle  and set to lose her scholarship to college  
when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story  they end up tying her up  and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman  
critique  its not so much that this is a bad movie  than the fact that it sucks  
this movie is chockfull of onedimensional characters  contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on  zero tension or thrills  plot holes the size of my big ass  lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie  and molly ringwald  vivica a  fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles  
i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery    and  to   but unfortunately for williamson  he went nowhere with the bright foundation  making references to the exorcist and dr  
zhivago  which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate  
he also forgot about suspense  with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions  unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue  
sure  katie holmes is cute  and her costar  marisa coughlan  did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist  worth two points out of my three on ten   but how can we forgive the biggest onedimensional character in any film  holmes rival in the film  mrs  tingles complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her  are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays   and a transparent romance between holmes and some longhaired dude  hired to be the poor mans version of skeet ulrich  who himself is a poor mans version of johnny depp    
all in all  this movie was laughable for me  provided me with no insight into anything  demonstrated williamsons genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script  and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into  unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability  humanity or capacity to comprehend  
no hip lines  no cheap thrills  just a dull time at the movie theater  
if you want to see a funny teenage movie  go see detroit rock city     and thank my drunken  sorry ass in the morning
