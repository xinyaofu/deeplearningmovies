in a typical cinematic high school  the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them  but not before the boys scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books  
as the sexual acts take place  the other guys hang out nearby  guzzling beer and grunting like pigs  
in the rage  carrie   robert mandels terminally bland sequel to carrie  there isnt a single original moment  
only amy irving returns from carrie  and the talent of the rest of the sequels cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreus script  
as rachel  the horror storys lead  emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory  but it isnt exactly her fault  
the director asks for little from his actors  which is precisely what he gets  
sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie  rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open  but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim  
her fellow students delight in tormenting her  
of course  she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers  
as the movie marks time until its big finale  it throws in some repugnant scenes  hoping to turn audiences stomachs  
rachels girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made  love  to her the night before spurns her  
  he gets major points in his black book for this  but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death   
even a helpless puppy is run over  and we see his poor  little body flipping over and over under a truck  
the teenagers in the movie are completely blas  about it all  
  doesnt it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday   asks one of the few kids with a conscience  
  why   
responds his nonplussed girlfriend  
  she wasnt anybody   
remarkably devoid of any energy  especially for a horror flick  the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theaters armrest  
with material this bad  the films only hope is to go for parody  but it isnt smart enough to realize it  
even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie  
the rage  carrie  runs     
it is rated r for graphic violence  teen alcohol abuse  sex  nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers
