if anything   stigmata  should be taken as a warning against releasing similarlythemed films relatively close to one another  
of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year  it is clearly the worst  
i suppose i should have seen this coming  
after all   blair witch  thoroughly creeped me out   sixth sense  was mildly spooky  and then  stir of echoes  had its moments  but wasnt anything id lose sleep over  
clearly  the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping  
is it then any surprise that  stigmata  is the dullest  most horribly executed piece of mtvinfluenced tripe i have seen in a long while  
no  not really  
patricia arquette plays frankie page  a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globetrotting mother  
as it turns out  the rosary belonged to a recentlydeceased brazilian priest  
the priests church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan  gabriel byrne  because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  
father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs  but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  
his investigation is soon called off  however  when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata  in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  
father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story  considering shes an atheist  but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself  he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss  cardinal houseman  jonathan pryce   is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  
as it turns out  the dead priest had been working on the translation of a  fifth gospel  before they were excommunicated  
the new rupert wainwright music video  
  
  
i mean film  stigmata  is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  
indeed  it would have been good if it were a music video  because its only interesting for about five minutes  
im not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slowmotion  doubleexposure  and extreme closeups  whoaaaaaa       other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and  yes  he has been to film school  
his camera trickery is interesting for a little while  but eventually  it becomes headacheinducing  
what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue  such as it is   with wainwright screaming at the audience   see  
look at what i can do  
im an excellent director   
maybe then hed explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slowmotion shots of water dripping in reverse  or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying  ooh  scary    
if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery  i didnt see it  
just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story  here comes a doubleexposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever  
arrrrrrrghhhh  
  
  
then again  the superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother me if  stigmata  had a story or characters that were remotely engaging  
though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help  he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script  
where are plot continuity and character development when you need them  
case in point  frankie page is the character that  i assume  we are supposed to identify and sympathize with  but we arent given any back story on her character  or any reason to like her  
the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hardworking hairdresser  who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building  and shes kind of cute  so lets start the bleeding  
the fact that shes clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesnt help  either  
according to frankie page  what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back  
go clubbing  
sure  that makes sense  
arquette  byrne  and pryce give it the old college try  but their characters are so onedimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking  
scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat  because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable  
even though frankie pages life is falling apart before her very eyes  she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon  
even more curiously  he seems to be interested in her advances  
father andrews religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic  
as for pryce  he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle   ill get you  my pretty   for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded  
trust me  im not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain  
whats worse  after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats  we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction  veers off in another  then another  and ends up being totally incomprehensible  
first of all  the film doesnt even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details  how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary  
how come an atheist like her was chosen  since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata  
actually  im not sure what frankie was posessed by  
supposedly  stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit  but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest  and later by some evil spirit  i think   
which one is it  
the answer to this question  of course  is very simple  the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr  wainwright wants to use this time  
furthermore  the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrapup  and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church  
if you do any research at all about the gospel of st  thomas  youll find that it is not being suppressed by the church  as the film seems to claim   but that it is readily available at your local library  
theres nothing the catholics need to worry about  though  
  stigmatas  religion is so offbase that it cant be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church  
if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters  they should have gone allout and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns  which would have been far more interesting  
im not catholic  in fact  i don t care much for the catholic church  but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means  
its rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as  stigmata  does  
it s not thoughtprovoking  though it would like to be  and it is definitely not scary  though it pretends to be  
im not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film  because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story  
maybe its an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever  
the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over  and over  and over  
like so many films of the mtv generation  this one suffers from overkill  
so much is overdone in  stigmata   that it eventually has no effect on the audience  leaving us to pick out the films  many  flaws  
im also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st  thomas is so earthshattering  
when we finally hear it  the saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns on their first day of sunday school  which means that for all its flash  the whole film is really much ado about nothing  
the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog  and  stigmata  is it
