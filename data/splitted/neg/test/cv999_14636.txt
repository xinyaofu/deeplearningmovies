two party guys bob their heads to haddaways dance hit  what is love   
while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub  
its barely enough to sustain a threeminute saturdaynightlive skit  but snl producer lorne michaels  clueless creator amy heckerling  and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institutions recurring  roxbury guys  sketch that would presumably make a good feature  
emphasis on the word  presumably   
anightattheroxbury takes an alreadythin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking pointand that of viewers patience levels  
the first five minutes or so of roxbury play very much like one of the original  roxbury guys  skits  
with  what is love   
blaring on the soundtrack  the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi  chris kattan and will ferrell  bob their heads  scope out  hotties  at clubs  and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts  
there is one crucial difference  howeverthese guys speak  
that little fact has been used as justification for the films existence  that the butabis newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters  
the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren  ferrell  and kattan are new  thats for sure  but they all lead to comic dead ends  
there is no story per se  only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots  
the brothers literally run into  or  rather  get run into  as in by car  richard grieco of jumpstreet fame  and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club  
there  they meet a hotshot club owner  chazz palminteri  conspicuously uncreditedcan you blame him    who takes an interest in an idea of theirs  
meanwhile  the bros overbearing father  dan hedaya  wants them to stop clubbing  
when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father  a rift is created between the two  
the narrative messiness of roxbury would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny  but virtually none of it is  
the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film  with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end  
alas  the jokea rather lazy takeoff on jerrymaguirewill only strike a chord with people who have seen that film  
granted  a lot of people have seen jerrymaguire  but the fact that the films best joke is completely dependent on ones familiarity with another film says a lot about roxburys lack of inspiration  
that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves  
like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of saturdaynightlive   the roxbury guys  is a onejoke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context  
after watching one of the  roxbury  skits on snl  this is what you come away with from the characters  they bob their heads to  what is love    
bump unsuspecting women  and    thats all  
after watching anightattheroxbury  youll be left with exactly the same
