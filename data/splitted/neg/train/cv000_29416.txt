plot  two teen couples go to a church party  drink and then drive  
they get into an accident  
one of the guys dies  but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life  and has nightmares  
whats the deal  
watch the movie and  sorta  find out    
critique  a mindfuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea  but presents it in a very bad package  
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write  since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold  mess with your head and such  lost highway  memento   but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films  and these folks just didnt snag this one correctly  
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept  but executed it terribly  
so what are the problems with the movie  
well  its main problem is that its simply too jumbled  
it starts off  normal  but then downshifts into this  fantasy  world in which you  as an audience member  have no idea whats going on  
there are dreams  there are characters coming back from the dead  there are others who look like the dead  there are strange apparitions  there are disappearances  there are a looooot of chase scenes  there are tons of weird things that happen  and most of it is simply not explained  
now i personally dont mind trying to unravel a film every now and then  but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again  i get kind of fed up after a while  which is this films biggest problem  
its obviously got this big secret to hide  but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes  
and do they make things entertaining  thrilling or even engaging  in the meantime  
not really  
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this  so we actually figured most of it out by the halfway point  so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense  but it still didnt the make the film all that more entertaining  
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is  into it  even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding  
i mean  showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about  minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy   
okay  we get it    there 
are people chasing her and we dont know who they are  
do we really need to see it over and over again  
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie  
apparently  the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves  and it shows  
there mightve been a pretty decent teen mindfuck movie in here somewhere  but i guess  the suits  decided that turning it into a music video with little edge  would make more sense  
the actors are pretty good for the most part  although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty  only in a new neighborhood  
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller  who holds her own throughout the entire film  and actually has you feeling her characters unraveling  
overall  the film doesnt stick because it doesnt entertain  its confusing  it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime  despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it  
oh  and by the way  this is not a horror or teen slasher flick    its 
just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids  
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since  
whatever    skip 
it  
wheres joblo coming from  
a nightmare of elm street      blair witch      the crow     the crow  salvation     lost highway     memento     the others     stir of echoes
