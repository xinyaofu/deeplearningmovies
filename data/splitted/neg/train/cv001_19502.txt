the happy bastards quick movie review 
damn that yk bug  
its got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother  william this time  in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on  
little do they know the power within    
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there  virus still feels very empty  like a movie going for all flash and no substance  
we dont know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere  we dont know the origin of what took over the ship  just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir   and  of course  we dont know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout  
here  its just  hey  lets chase these people around with some robots   
the acting is below average  even from the likes of curtis  
youre more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h  
sutherland is wasted and baldwin  well  hes acting like a baldwin  of course  
the real star here are stan winstons robot design  some schnazzy cgi  and the occasional good gore shot  like picking into someones brain  
so  if robots and body parts really turn you on  heres your movie  
otherwise  its pretty much a sunken ship of a movie
