  quest for camelot  is warner bros   first featurelength  fullyanimated attempt to steal clout from disneys cartoon empire  but the mouse has no reason to be worried  
the only other recent challenger to their throne was last falls promising  if flawed  th century fox production  anastasia   but disneys  hercules   with its lively cast and colorful palate  had her beat handsdown when it came time to crown s best piece of animation  
this year  its no contest  as  quest for camelot  is pretty much dead on arrival  
even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre  thatd be  pocahontas  for those of you keeping score  isnt nearly as dull as this  
the story revolves around the adventures of freespirited kayley  voiced by jessalyn gilsig   the earlyteen daughter of a belated knight from king arthurs round table  
kayleys only dream is to follow in her fathers footsteps  and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber  gary oldman   an exround table membergonebad  steals arthurs magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous  boobytrapped forest  
with the help of hunky  blind timberlanddweller garrett  carey elwes  and a twoheaded dragon  eric idle and don rickles  thats always arguing with itself  kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthurs side  
  quest for camelot  is missing pure showmanship  an essential element if its ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney  
theres nothing here that differentiates  quest  from something youd see on any given saturday morning cartoon  subpar animation  instantly forgettable songs  poorlyintegrated computerized footage  
  compare kayley and garretts runin with the angry ogre to hercs battle with the hydra  
i rest my case   
even the characters stink  none of them are remotely interesting  so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can outbland the others  
in the end  its a tie  they all win  
that dragons comedy shtick is awfully cloying  but at least it shows signs of a pulse  
at least fans of the earlys tgif television lineup will be thrilled to find jaleel  urkel  white and bronson  balki  pinchot sharing the same footage  
a few scenes are nicely realized  though im at a loss to recall enough to be specific   and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic  though most are paired up with singers who dont sound a thing like them for their big musical moments  jane seymour and celine dion      
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good  
aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults   quest for camelot  s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality  
and personality  we learn from this mess  goes a very long way
