synopsis  a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boys mother  a fledgling restauranteur  
unsuccessfully attempting to gain the womans favor  he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way  
comments  stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurnedpsychosgettingtheirrevenge type movies which are a stable category in the s film industry  both theatrical and directtovideo  
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that theyre typically inexpensive to produce  no special effects  no big name stars  and serve as vehicles to flash nudity  allowing them to frequent latenight cable television   
stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect  the psycho never actually has an affair  on the contrary  hes rejected rather quickly  the psycho typically is an exlover  exwife  or exhusband   
other than that  stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable  
stalked does not provide much suspense  though that is what it sets out to do  
interspersed throughout the opening credits  for instance  a serioussounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk  its implicitly implied that all stalkers are men  while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen  
after these credits  a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears  
the narrator states that  this is the story of daryl gleason  and tells the audience that he is the stalker  
of course  really  this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels  
if the movie was meant to be about daryl  then it should have been called stalker not stalked  
okay  so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts  no guesswork required  
stalked proceeds  then  as it begins  obvious  obvious  obvious  
the opening sequence  contrived quite a bit  brings daryl and brooke  the victim  together  
daryl obsesses over brooke  follows her around  and tries to woo her  
ultimately rejected by her  his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate  
these plans include the alltime  psychoinlove  cliche  the murdered pet  
for some reason  this genres films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked  
stalked is no exception  its a cat this time  found in the shower   
events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked  where only one survives  guess who it invariably always is and youll guess the conclusion to this turkey   
stalkeds cast is uniformly adequate  not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either  
jay underwood  as the stalker  turns toward melodrama a bit too much  
he overdoes it  in other words  but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands  
maryam dabo  about the only actor close to being a star here  she played the bond chick in the living daylights   is equally adequate as the  stalked  of the title  even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong  independent businessowner  
brooke  dabo  needs to be ditzy  however  for the plot to proceed  
toward the end  for example  brooke has her suspicions about daryl  
to ensure he wont use it as another excuse to see her  brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house  
does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers  
of course not  
she tries the door  opens it  and wanders around the house  
when daryl returns  he enters the house  of course  so our heroine is in danger  
somehow  even though her car is parked at the front of the house  right by the front door  daryl is oblivious to her presence inside  
the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audiences suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either characters intelligence  
stalked receives two stars because  even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring  it is not so bad that it cannot be watched  
rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar  it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are  
if youre in the mood for a good suspense film  though  stake out something else
