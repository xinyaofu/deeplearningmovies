thats exactly how long the movie felt to me  
there werent even nine laughs in nine months  
its a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man  mr  hugh grant  a huge dork  
its not the whole oralsexprostitution thing  referring to grant  not me  that bugs me  its the fact that grant is annoying  
not just adam sandlerannoying  were talking jim carreyannoying  
since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting  
but  on the other hand  since when do really bad slapstick  a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grants head in joan cusacks lapa scene he paid  to have included in the movie  and obscene double entendres  robin williams  the obstetrician  tells grants pregnant girlfriend she has  a big pussy   referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat  but nonetheless  grant paid  to have the exchange included in the movie  pass for comedy  
nine months is a predictable cookiecutter movie with no originality in humor or plot  
hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist  
why a child psychologist  
so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange  
kid  my dads an asshole  
grant  flutters eyelashes  offers a nervous smile  then responds in his annoying english accent and ithinkiactuallyhave talent attitude   could you possibly elaborate on that  
kid  my dads a huge asshole  
more like a hugh asshole  but thats beside the point  which is  nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief  
so  anyway  grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction  fluttered eyelashes  nervous smiles   
this paves the way for every possible pregnancychild birth gag in the book  especially since grants equally annoying friends wife is also pregnant  
the annoying friend is played by tom arnold  who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick  none of which is funny  such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed  arnie the dinosaur   you draw your own parallels on that one  in a toy store  
the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum  who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway  as an artist with a fear of  and simultaneous longing for  commitment  
not even robin williams  who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics  has much humor  
his is a onejoke character the old foreignguywhomispronouncesenglish stereotype  did someone say yakov smirnov  
thats my favorite vodka  by the way   hence the line  now its time to take a look at your volvo   another nasty but unamusing joke  except this one goes right over the ten year olds heads  while the adults simultaneously groan  
nine months is a complete failure  low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud  unfunny slapstick  failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy  
hugh grants sunset boulevard arrest  please  no caughtwithhispantsdown jokes  may bring more people into the theaters  but they certainly wont leave with a smile on their faces  not after  minutes of grants nervous smiles  
everything in the movie is so forced  so unauthentic that anyone with an i  q  
over   sorry  hugh  will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire  
but at least they didnt spend  bucks for it
