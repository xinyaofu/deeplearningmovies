plot  a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth  oops    i 
mean  an evil man  
he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself  
anyway  fourteen years go by and    arrgh  well  you know the rest    swishswishzzzzzzz  
critique  this is a pretty bad movie  
lets see  where should i start  
okay  first of all  the story is just plain boring  
its not original  is entirely predictable and lacks energy  
okay  whats next  
acting  you say  
hmmmm  well  the main actor  justin chambers  is basically an uncharismatic version of chris odonnell but with less range  think about that    and mena suvari  is just plain off  
not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons  dragons  but entirely miscast  with bad deliveries  awful sequences and a pisspoor accent that comes and goes  
now im not sure if this was ms  suvaris fault or the directors  but ive definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film  
the only semisaving grace actorwise is tim roth as the irrepressible  bad guy   but once again  its not something that we havent seen before    a 
thousand times    by the same guy   
tim  please    for the love of god  beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day  american roles  for you as a  nice guy  in a romantic comedy or something  
stretch  dude    stretch   
we all know that you can do much better than this gunk  
alright  what else was bad in this film  
oh yeah  the score  
yikes  hows about taking it down a few notches there  fellas  
this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene  but actually does little more than annoy  
i think its important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isnt a  real epic  by any stretch of the imagination  
its a fluffy rehashed cakewalk created by some  shrewd  studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole  kungfu  phenomenon in films  and test it out on an old classic  
dudes    you 
failed all around  
  keep reading  
the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie  the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems    plentiful  
  why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top  
why dont they just cut the mouseketeers rope at the top of the tower  instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging  
why doesnt anybody look a day older  when the sequence says   years later   
  at least    change 
your shirt  man   
keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a  fun time   but this flick just didnt cut it for me  
it was boring for stretches  the acting was atrocious at times  the  romantic  scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe   there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat  
i will give the movie this much  and that is that its main reason for being  its  raisondetre   as the french would say   its fight sequences  do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film  
i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer  but what you see there  are essentially the snippets from the two major  and cool  swashbuckling sequences from the film  
the first comes right at the beginning of the movie  while the other essentially finishes the film off  hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders  
the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap  
and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this films credits  
hullo  
the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers  
deneuve is barely in this movie  
ugh  just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash  
now say it together  gang   all for one  and one for all    we 
vow to stay away from it all    
thank me later  
wheres joblo coming from  
a knights tale     american outlaws     crouching tiger  hidden dragon     the matrix     the replacement killers     romeo must die     shanghai noon
