best remembered for his understated performance as dr  hannibal lecter in michael manns forensics thriller  manhunter  scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on  
usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock  he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight   hes only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do  
if you want to see some brilliant acting  check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loachs hidden agenda  
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l  i  e   which lot  picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge  
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name  but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad  
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light  
hes an eventempered  funny  robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems  as opposed to their parents and friends  both caught up in the highwire act of their own confused lives   
hell have sexforpay with them only after an elaborate courtship  charming them with temptations from the grownup world  
l  i  e  stands for long island expressway  which slices through the strip malls and middleclass homes of suburbia  
filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a  pretty transparent  metaphor of dangerous escape for his year old protagonist  howie  paul franklin dano   
in his opening voiceover  howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road  citing the l  i  e  
highway deaths of filmmaker alan j  pakula  songwriter harry chapin  and his own mother on exit   
hes both fascinated and disturbed by the l  i  e   and those feelings are projected onto big john  who follows howie around in his bright red car  but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesnt want to do  
this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies  hes a beast  but ashamed of it   
l  i  e  would have worked best as a halfhour short film about howies illadvised foray into big johns haven  
there is unnecessary padding with howies miserable dad  bruce altman  in the hot seat for a whitecollar crime  degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middleclass houses  and some homoerotic shenanigans with wiseass gary terrio  billy kay   a handsome artful dodger  
rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui  not that we needed another movie on that subject   these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length  
concurrently  the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted  
cox  sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo  is all bluff and bluster  
dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent  
were so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious  calling haley joel    its surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene  
the restraint is admirable  
but l  i  e  s screenplay doesnt always give them the best material  
when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem  the moment feels a bit too precious  
director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john  who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bachs goldberg variations  
its too much  
there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big johns other boy toy  walter masterson   jealous over the newbie  
this plot thread predictably leads to violence  
not content to be a haunting  observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world  like terry zwigoffs superb ghost world   cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note  
its typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet  sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex  philosophical note  
in this regard  l  i  e  
  and countless other indie films  share something in common with blockbuster action films  problems are solved when the obstacle is removed  
how often does real life work this way  
to extend the question  if a movie is striving for realism  do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion
