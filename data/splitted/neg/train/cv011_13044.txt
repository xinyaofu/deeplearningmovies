janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy  it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker  
this is a bythebooks movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs  
it also jumps on the everpopular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there  too  
garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator  jay o  sanders  running for reelection  
denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent thats made the kennedy family so popular  
so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit  
she soon learns why  easier said than done  is the mantra of movies like this  
the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong  garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland  almost misses the bus to town  cant get a hotel room  ends up in the smallest  trashiest one around  has a dog piss on her luggage  and so on  
then comes what roger ebert calls the  meet cute   
it happens in every romance  the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional  cinematic way  
in the matchmaker  it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean  david ohara  in the bathtub  his dog sitting at his side  
no points for guessing its the same dog that just made water on her luggage  
also no points for guessing garofalo hates ohara on sight  
thats how it works in movies like these  
i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that shed hate him for awhile  then succumb to his charms  live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil  after which theyd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits  
i havent mentioned the movies twist yet  
garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival  during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss  
milo oshea  who looks like an irish tom snyder  is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together  
rest assured hell do all he can to match up garofalo and ohara  
oh  and in keeping with the matchmakers utter predictability  he dies toward the end  
what the message here  
sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction  like garofalo  will sell out with a weak script  
i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie  but they actually only have two or three scenes together  
leary stays stateside  for the most part  yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole  
he even undoes himself with the old microphones still on after hes done giving the speech cliche  
both of them should have known better
