john carpenter makes bmovies  
always has   halloween    escape from new york    the thing   and  by the looks of it   they live    escape from l  a     vampires    always will  
carpenters latest horror opus with a science fiction bent  or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent  is the aptlytitled  john carpenters ghosts of mars   in case  i suppose  you went looking for someone elses  ghosts of mars    
like all those films prefixed by the very possessive  john carpenters    ghosts of mars  is an unashamed bmovie punctuated by a bmovie plot  bmovie actors  and bmovie special effects  
in category one  above  we have a storyline that borders on idiotic  and  at times  chaotic   
dormant martians  i  e   swirling red gases  awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes  
all this explained  in flashback  to some grand poohbah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard  natasha henstridge  from the sub  species  films   the only returnee on a sillylooking train  
officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james  desolation  williams  what she found was not a pretty picture  
in the second category we have ms  henstridge  her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail  ice cube  as the appropriatelynamed  desolation    pam grier  briefly  oddlywho wanted to work with whom i wonder    and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didnt need to try too hard  
in category number three we have  in addition to those swirling red gases and the sillylooking train  a couple of birdseyeview shots of a sprawling martian metropolis  reddish also   
stateoftheart special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writerdirector  who seems to have no problem finding work  however  doesnt waste any of the films budget in that department  
  ghosts of mars  is lock  laughing stock  and barrel all your standard carpenter fare  dingy interiors  cluttered exteriors  inane dialogue  lots of leather  scarred  crazedlooking aliens  and lots and lots of weaponry  
the film often and always explodes into warfare without warningspontaneously  stupidly  
carpenter might like to think hes made a western here but its a western without any real heroes  villains  or border conflicts  
its just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken  
i never thought id miss the guy but i do  
its not  all  the same  however  
dubbed the  onenote wonder  for his minimalist music soundtracks  carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic  yet effective  scoring by highlighting his action with loud  screeching guitar work  
fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue  
the final exchange between henstridge and  er  cube though is both audible  and  priceless  
mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so  what with the stillborn  mission to mars  and  red planet   with val kilmer   
  ghosts of mars  sadly adds to those disappointing returns  in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels  among them  american pie   and  rush hour     
the irony is that the mars in carpenters film feels sadly absent  
there are occasional references to the red planet  of course  but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earths closest neighbor  
two things keep  john carpenters ghosts of mars  from getting a huge slap upside the head  
  
henstridge keeps her top on  miraculously   and   the film doesnt pretend to be anything its not  
what that means  however  is that fans of superior  intelligent  grade a scifihorror are singularly out of luck
