im really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone  
sure  she is one of the most beautiful creatures on gods green earth  second only to that movie critic at large guy   but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in  she always strikes out  
the crush was a slowmoving  predictable piece of fluff  
hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in  
clueless was an annoying  unfunny waste of time  
and people have emailed me too  saying clueless is a good movie and that im the only one who doesnt like it  
one girl said if id seen the movie with  an open mind   i would have enjoyed it  
nothing could be further from the truth  
i went into the theater expecting to love the movie  
the preview looked good and of course im crazymadinlove with alicia  but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny  unlikable characters  
almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way  
when we were walking out of the theater  one guy  and it wasnt me  yelled out   that was the worst fin movie ive ever seen  and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement  
so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicias pretty face on the cover of some madeforvideo thriller called the babysitter  
i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ill probably never understand made me rent it anyway  
what i got was  minutes of regretthe worst alicia silverstone movie ever  
and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like  
where to begin in criticizing this movie  
the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier  the writing could have been done  and for all we know it was  by a ten year old  alicia is the star and shes still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever  
there is zero humor  zero suspense  zero drama and zero action  until the last ten minutes  when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence  
zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero  
so why does this movie get one star out of me  
well  alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub  
and if it wasnt bubble bath  the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four star features  but you settle for what you can get  
alicia plays a babysitter whos spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party  
and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home  at least that movie critic at large guy does   
as the movie trods along  we discover shes not only the mostlysilent star of the movie but also the object of every male characters fantasies  and probably every male viewers too   
the drunken father thinks shes just the thing to recapture his lost youth  her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside  even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while shes taking her bubble bath  
they even throw in the middle aged wifes fantasies about a male counterpart at the party  
not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this  pound woman in a black silk teddy  
at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pgrated  
in fact  i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax latenight staple if not for the fact that theres absolutely no nudity in it  
so you cant call it a sex flick  
ive already pointed out that it cant fall under drama  comedy  thriller or action  so what do you classify the babysitter as  
bad
