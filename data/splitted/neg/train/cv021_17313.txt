  in dreams  might keep you awake at night  but not because of its creepy imagery  bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths  
no  the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movies brutally squandered potential  the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise  even by tired serial killer genre standards  
the big letdown  however  comes upon the realization that this minute headscratcher was masterminded by neil jordan  the man behind  the crying game   
hes no stranger to cinematic weirdness  but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope  
things start out strong enough  with cinematographer darius khondjis stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat  
this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film  theres even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic  seemingly innocent new england autumn  but if there ever was a film that didnt deserve so good a polish  its this one  
dont knock the look  but say what you will about the foolish plot  underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue  
annette bening  another asset  in dreams  shouldnt be so lucky to boast  gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesnt do much for her in return  
she plays claire cooper  a massachusetts childrens book illustrator whos plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children  
she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible  soontobecommitted crimes  but neither her hohum husband  aidan quinn  nor the hohummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously  
this being a thriller  we know that she is  in fact  on the money  and its a credit to benings acting that she delves equally into claires madness and compassion  
but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims   in dreams  trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense  
scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition  
subplots appear and disappear  
when claire finally comes facetoface with our evil murderer  robert downey jr    it turns out his name is vivian  hes clairvoyant and hes got some major issues with mama  a la norman bates  
  in dreams  reaches its absurdist zenith here  and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists  
some questions  then  whats with the garbage disposal retching applesauce  
are the drawings on the wall blood or paint  
who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own  
what about the computer  
does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers  
why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan  
is the woman in australia integral to anything  
and the aforementioned flooded city  what function does that really serve  
sigh  
at least in my own dreams  i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didnt go to waste
