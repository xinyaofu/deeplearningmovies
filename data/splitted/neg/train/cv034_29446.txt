if youre into watching near on two hours of bored  foulmouthed florida teens having sex  doing drugs  having sex  listening to eminem  having sex  playing video games  having sex  and killing one of their peers  then  bully  s for you  
based on jim schutzes novelization of a truelife event   bully  charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who  in   murdered their high school bully in cold  calculated blood  
the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers  
in the hands of controversial director larry clark   kids    however  it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmakers pornographic proclivities  
in terms of the incident and what provoked it   bully  stirs up nothing new  
the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lotbored with life  not much ambition  promiscuous  profane  
the bully in question  bobby kent  nick stahl   is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesnt exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department  
he hounds and harries and humiliates his  best friend  marty  played by brad renfro  and martys girlfriend lisa  rachel miner  doesnt care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby  
simply remove him from the equation  
marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous  profane  and stoner friends  plus a recruited hit man     lure bobby to a swamp one night  stab him  beat him over the head with a baseball bat  and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators  presumably  finish him off  
theres no remorsethe next day theyre talking about it as openly as a homework assignment  
they did it because they wanted to  and because they could  
whats most troubling about the film  however  isnt the unsettling subject matter and the matteroffact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material  
not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in  bully  but theres also an uneasy  exploitative feel to it  
gratuitous crotch shots abound  one of which makes the zipper cutaway in  theres something about mary  look like the height of subtlety    
clark is so preoccupied with his female  predominantly  leads that you forget  at times  what this movie is supposed to be about  
the stripping bare  literally and figuratively  of these actors  who are  after all  playing underage teenagers  becomes harder to watch over time  as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera  
the conclusion of  bully  offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime  
its a short sequence of stillsheather   years  ali   years  lisa  life imprisonment  for examplebut its infinitely more telling than the  minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it  
  bully  aims for truth  exploits it shamelessly  then bludgeons it to death
