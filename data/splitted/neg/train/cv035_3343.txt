sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom  by way of the everglades  to defend a young  educated black man  blair underwood   
the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl  and says that his confession was coerced from the regions tough  black cop  lawrence fishburne   
watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough  but the plots a joke  
theres no logic at work here  
tone is also an issuethere is none  
director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say  
is it a statement on human rights  
is it a knockoff of silence of the lambs  
glimcher never tells  
instead  he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop  over drawbridge after drawbridge  hoping that the audience wont notice whats missing  
just awful

in suri krishnammas a man of no importance  albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that its a shame when the film gets so serious around him  
his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde  
he reads to his riders  and once a year  with their help  he tries to stage one of the authors plays  
this year its  salome   
for about an hour  theres a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of workingclass stiffs  
conflict arises  but its small stuffan administrator from the bus company here  an outraged catholic pork butcher  michael gambon  there  
but with finney at the wheel  so to speak  the film rolls smoothly over these plot pointsjust like the gorgeous leland doubledecker bus in the story  
where things get serious is toward the end of the film  when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would  and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride  
the twist makes senseand helps paint a complete picture of finneys characterbut the trip to get there betrays the light  airy atmosphere of what had come before  
its not a fatal misstep  mind you  and it doesnt send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity  
its just a turn off

the most fun that  i  had last month was in durham  at the carolina  at a midweek screening of stanley kubricks pitchblack comedy dr  
strangelove  or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb   
the  film stars peter sellers  in three roles   george c  scott  sterling hayden  and slim pickens  
their antics brought the house down  which  to my surprise  was packed by an audience younger than the film
