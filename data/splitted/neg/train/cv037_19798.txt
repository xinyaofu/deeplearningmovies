  lake placid  marks yet another entry in the series of  predator pics  that were a screen staple in the late s  post  jaws   and were revived recently by the godawful  anaconda   
  placid  claims to be a  horrorcomedy  its directed by the same guy who did  house  but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of  anaconda   
paleontologist kelly scott  bridget fonda  is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake  
discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile  which shouldnt even be in this hemisphere   kelly goes crochunting with game warden jack wells  bill pullman  and sheriff hank keough  brendan gleeson   
theyre joined by an unwelcome guest  hector cyr  oliver platt   a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them  
along the way  the merry band meets mrs  delores bickerman  betty white   a weird old lady who lives out on the lake  
you know what to expect from this movie  lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator  croc cam  swimming toward someones dangling legs while  jaws  like music plays  one character  hector  whos obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest  another character who insists that the predator cant possibly exist  
unlike its slippery cousin  anaconda    lake placid  wants to present its formulaic plot tongueincheek  which is selfdefeating  
the result is neither scary nor funny  its just tedious  
while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume  including two installments of  friday the th  and  halloween h    screenwriter david kelley  best known as the creator of tv series like  ally mcbeal  and  chicago hope   doesnt seem to have the stomach for a chomp em up flick  
the body count is surprisingly low and doesnt include any of the major characters  and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it  
   lake placid  manages to have it both waysill let you discover how for yourself   
the croc itself is mostly computergenerated  of course  
like the snake in  anaconda   the thirtyfoot monster crocodile doesnt seem real  it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural  
  lake placid  also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine  
there is a lot of semimystical mumbo jumbo about how  we really dont know much about crocodiles   
they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers  
a movie like this doesnt have to offer much of an explanation  radioactive mutant  
creature from outer space    but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on  
pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on autopilot  
most of the time  theyre probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers  
platt and white  on the other hand  seem to be giving their best efforts  and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script
