  party camp   is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ive seen in awhile  
a late ripoff of the  meatballs  series  the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk  
thats really about all that can be said about the  plot  because nothing much happens  except that the main character  wisecracking jerry  andrew ross   has the hots for a cute blonde  kerry brennan   and there is a big contest in the climax  
how fun  
since   party camp   has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved  the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative  
its not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality  but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this  the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex  
even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick  
at least  then  it wouldnt have been such a chore to sit through  
never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat  
the comedy was easy to spot  but it wasnt the least bit funny  
it was groaninducing  
constantly throghout  i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything  
so what saves   party camp   from the dreaded zero star rating  
well  thats simple  jewel shepard  as a flighty bimbo  was admittedly fun to watch  
although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash  at least if the film had centered on shepard  she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid  lowbudget teen comedy
