when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy  i expect negative reviews from critics left and right  
predictable  unoriginal  and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to yous and the drive me crazys released by the dozens these last couple of years  
what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while im sitting in the theater  
am i enjoying myself  
is this a comfortable break from my week of finals  
this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks  i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i wont remember next week  
so last week i opened up the new york times  and  no surprise  boys and girls got a negative review  
daily news

this was nothing new  
american pie  final destination  road trip didnt get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures  
same goes for shes all that  a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded  
since boys and girls reunites shes all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr   i predicted d  j  vu al over again  
but  still curious  i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it  the reactions were far from positive  
i had made up my mind  ill catch it on video or cable in a couple of years  
but  soon after  following a series of unexpected events  we couldnt get into shaft because it is rated r   i found myself watching boys and girls  
whoops  
boys and girls is about a  nerdy  smart  boy named ryan  prinze jr   and a  popular  flirt  girl named jennifer  claire forlani   
briefly meeting as preteens and now attending the same college  the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends  
but in the movies  a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other  
with advice from their roommates  amanda detmer  jason biggs   ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship  
the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives  and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found  
i could hardly sit through the  minute running time for several reasons  
the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie  mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to  
it is almost offensive  
an example of an insightful conversation  
  youre dumb  
dumb  dumb  dumb  dumb   
  no   
  followed by a mandy mooreesque tune background  
  well its not as bad as wing commander i guess  
the supporting cast is also painfully useless  
detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring  pointless subplots  
and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex  prinze jrs ryan dominates the screen while forlanis jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with  
we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character  
teenager or not  youll hate this movie  i guarantee it  
maybe i should rent shes all that again  
is it really as good as i think it is
