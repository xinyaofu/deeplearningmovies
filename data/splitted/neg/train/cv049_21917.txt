  the world on land  its just too big for me   
starring tim roth  pruitt taylor vince  bill nunn  clarence williams iii  
rated r  
the legend of s is the years most absurd movie  a rambling  nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast  
it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth  looking wistful as ever  as a guy named    
  
you heard right  
his name is  in all actuality    
he was born on an ocean liner on   uh  hence the name   abandoned and adopted by danny  a ship crewman  
 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of dannys fear that he might be taken away from him because of  visa matters   
well  when  is about  or so  he starts wondering all around the ship  
one day  he discovers a grand piano  
he sits down and starts playing  
miraculously  what comes out is beautiful  
a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age  
when one of the people who knows  tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is  totally against regulations   replies  f  ck the regulations   
ho ho ho  
 grows up never setting foot on dry land  
when hes about ish and can play the piano like nobodys business  onboard comes another musician  
his name is max  pruitt taylor vince  and he plays the trumpet  
after  catches max barfing everywhere during a storm  he sits him down on the piano next to him  takes the pianos braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall  taking them with it  
how the chair theyre sitting on and the piano dont separate  i dont know  but this apparently isnt the kind of thing were supposed to ask  
after that   and max become friends  
max is determined to get  off the ship and discover what he is missing on land  but  has no intention of doing so  
whats more  he doesnt even want his music to go anywhere without him  when a record company hears about his talents  they come on board to make a record of his music  but after finding out that  gasp  
 theyre going to make millions of copies  he breaks the record  
the conflict of the movie is that after max  unsuccessful in his endeavor to get  off the ship  gets off himself  he stumbles upon a record of s music in a store  
the record shouldnt exist because a   never stepped on dry land and b  the one record that was made on the ship was broken  
ladies and gentlemen  its a mystery  
the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements  
were supposed to be roused by a climactic    
piano duel  
there isnt anything in this movie with the potential to compel  
 comes off as a whiny  brooding  extremely unlikable man  i cant recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life  
ditto for max  who doesnt seem to have a life outside his friendship with   
tim roth plays  with about as much panache as a fig leaf  theres no spirit  no gusto to the character  
he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship  but to us he is dead  
pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable  at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit  
the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant  leering  king of jazz  who challenges  to the aforementioned piano duel  
the legend of  was made by giuseppe tornatore  whose  cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many  
this effort is utterly limp and lifeless  
at once ridiculous  boring  narrowsighted and pointless  this is one movie that should be  and will be  quickly forgotten
