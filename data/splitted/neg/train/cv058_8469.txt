of course i knew this going in  
why is it that whenever a tvstar makes a movie its always a romantic comedy  and then they say on entertainment tonight or something  that they were  attracted to the characters  
they were really original   
original   let me give you a runthrough of picture perfect  character a  kate  jennifer aniston  from tvs friends   a smart  beautiful  professional woman wants two things she cant have  a new jobtitle and the love of her coworker kevin bacon  
her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar  and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls  
what does she do  
she invents a fiance  
then when everyone wants to meet him  she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him  to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner  and pick a fight with her at the end  thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job  since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor  defenceless female  
he  of course  goes along with it  
gee  i wonder if they get together in the end  
ive seen more original stuff on the wb  
and better stuff too  
picture perfect also makes the mistake of being wayyyyy too long at  minutes  and expecting us to like anistons character  who comes off as a cold  spoiled bitch
