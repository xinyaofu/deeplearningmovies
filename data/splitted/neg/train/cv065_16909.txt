movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good  the bad  and the despicable  
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in   but i wanted to rewrite it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  
we need to be warned about some truly awful films  too  
this picture was so bad  it inspired the description for my  rating  see ratings chart below   
the only thing saving it from a  rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  
so  it does indeed have some plusses    
in fairness  elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  
and her ability to whine and irritate us  even while nude  was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
this character is not smart  not interesting  and  deliberately   
far too annoying far too often  
like in s  bulworth   when the movie was over i didnt care one little iota about the main character  
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film  though  
  showgirls  is too stupid to make a statement  
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary  all about eve  of all things  
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was  hed be    well  
hed be a good screenwriter  
instead  this project may have sunk his career  
he wrote the  ha ha   
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  
the same team who created a good sexfilm in    basic instinct   struck out here with their occasional violence  gratuitous xrated sex scenes  and numerous  and quite unnecessary  lesbian overtones  
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  
after the supposed streetsmart young  lady  gets conned out of her suitcase by a slackjawed yokel in the opening sequence  she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the  stardust hotel   
nomi doesnt take advantage of this contact to break into the bigtime of dirty dancing right away  
first  she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  
she sells her hot little wares at  the cheetah  for a short time  turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience  
hey  i never said she wasnt a hot number    
maybe its that  her body  which gets her into the bigtime when the star of the  stardust hotel   crystal connors  gina gershon  stops into the strip club  it certainly isnt her brains or pleasant disposition    
crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend  kyle maclachlan   
he also happens to be the pleasureseeking worm who runs the big show  
crystal gets nomi onto the  stardust  team and  after an interminable amount of time  nomi  earns  the role of crystals understudy  
the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal  
it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that shes  not a whore   
thats a phrase we hear a few different times and its completely ludicrous  
of course she is  
she sells her soul to make it big  but in the end were supposed to believe that shes a better person than that  
were supposed to root for her  
no way  
shes a tramp and a backstabber who deserved nothingleast of all vindication in the    ahem    climax  
she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is  
the subplot with a male dancer  glenn plummer  who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more  
it sure aint character development  
plummer also appeared in  speed  in  in a smaller  yet better role  
this subplot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control  
kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big payday or his standards have dipped since appearing in  blue velvet   
that picture was weird  but some critics claim its one of the best movies of the s  
now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the s  too  
his sleazy character is important to  showgirls   but we dont learn anything about him  
he uses people to get what he wants  but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie  
is he a villain  
who cares  
ultimately  this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit  
everyone must know by now about the softcore acts of copulation  especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool  
what few reviewers take issue with is how meanspirited this movie is  
everyones either having sex  exacting revenge  or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge  
its just too hard to take  especially for over two hours   
if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world  why couldnt verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers  grunts  and other sounds during the dance numbers  
its hard to care about these people if we cant even appreciate what theyre capable of doing onstage  
berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body  
after all  the world of porn is still an active  dishonourable profession  
perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford  
oops  theyre bad actors  too  
well  at least  theyre not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone  
useless triviaironically  elizabeth berkley played virtuous and  holier than thou  jessie on the teenybopper tv show   saved by the bell   before breaking onto the big screen
