mr  nice guy is the latest jackie chan film  so you should know what to expect  
a weak plot  terrible dialogue  very little acting ability  but some jawdropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile  
however  mr  nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts  and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever  
jackie chan plays  who else  jackie  
this time out  hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show  
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot  
there are only two scenes of him cooking  
for the rest of the film  somehow he mutates into jackie chan  supercop  
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills    perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege  
a tv newswoman  diana  gabrielle fitzpatrick   covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo  richard norton  and a local gang of toughs  the demons  
although she only has one camcorder  somehow the result is full of closeups and multiple angles    hmmm  
shades of broadcast news    
anyway  the goons discover diana  and will do anything to recover the tape  
here lies another crucial flaw in the story  doesnt anyone realize you can copy a tape  
oh well  no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense  
as luck would have it  diana runs across jackie  and  wouldnt you know it  jackie accidentally ends up with the tape  
this leads to countless chase andor fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie  
in a move apparently designed to woo american  and other englishspeaking  audiences  the film uses english as its primary language  
however  that doesnt mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases  
strangely  many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english  and poorly too  
whether this is just a very bad case of looping  an effort to minimize accents  or a simple case of nostalgia  it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films  
the plot in mr  nice guy is negligible  merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons  
but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackies films  it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread  
look  if you have jackie chan playing a chef  why not use that to your advantage  
watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen  beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts  
the action is a mixed bag here  
theres really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films  
it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site  apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan  
the action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst  but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes  
the films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting  
once or twice  it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence  
but to slomo jackie running  
either this is a nod to the sixmillion dollar man  or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down  
if youve seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix  go ahead and see mr  nice guy  
however  if youre just in the mood for some good action  youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work  such as supercop
