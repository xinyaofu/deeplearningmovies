  there will be another   the ads for this sequel proclaimed  and why not  
true  brandon lee is dead  but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to s the crow  anyway  
the idea of spinning artist james obarrs original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie  taking its own righteous vengeance against the world  
given that basic framework  the story could move in any number of directions  
of course  it doesnt  
stubbornly  the crow  city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film  when lees eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death  
i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality  
in flashback  we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover  and then we watch in realtime as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind  
its loud and repetitive  true  a sadists delight  but its also horrifying and fascinating  
city of angels gives us more of the same  but less skillfully  
theres an audience guaranteed for a film like this  although bad reviews and poor wordofmouth will likely ensure that it wont be much of a success  
in fact  miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings  
  ive never understood the reasoning behind this tactic  since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow   
so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup  
this time  ashe  frenchaccented actor vincent perez  is retrieved from his watery death  he and his young son were shackled together  shot  and then thrown off a pier  by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead  
perez might have some screen presence if hes given something to do with himself  but here hes simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face  
at first  hes shivery and frightened  but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave  
hes befriended by sarah  mia kirshner   presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film  
kirshner  so beguiling in exotica  is here an exquisitely photographed blank  
tattooed with angels wings  sarah is just about as lovely as women come  but she serves no purpose  not even as seductress  
the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah  richard brooks   but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop  who plays a gaunt fellow named curve  
iggy  all bones  veins  and drawl  is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film  
like all good things here  hes dispatched too soon and without much imagination  
in the meantime  were subjected to tedious glimpses of judahs compound  where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in sm fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they werent distinctly secondhand  
even the soundtrack is tired  
more than anything ive seen from hollywood lately  city of angels smacks baldly of product  its a movie with a lousy script but a great look  
critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope  but his work isnt that bad per se  
hes got a good eye  and some intriguing visual ideas  if anything  this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery  
his major stylistic failing is that he cant seem to direct an action scene  and the quick  nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie  
but as director  he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasnt  the performers who couldnt  and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved  
who bought david s  goyers anemic script  anyway  
the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash  or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference
