ahh yes  
the teenage romance  
an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies  and in the end  the guy always gets the girl  
and with the arrival of the breakout hit shes all that last year  followed by a long catalogue of imitators including  things i hate about you and drive me crazy   the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity  
along now comes down to you  
the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid shes all that craze with their latest project  which has the studdly freddie prinze jr  attached and all  
only down to you doesnt have the  unlikely scenario mentioned above  
it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance  a dull  unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that were accustomed to  
this is the kind of romance that only giggly year old girls will find convincing  
in strictly textbook fashion  college sophomore and aspiring chef al  prinze jr   meets freshman artist imogen  julia stiles   
they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies  
from here  its the standard boymeetsgirl  boylosesgirl  boydrinksentirebottleofshampooandmayormaynotgetgirlback story  
the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters  who are frequently taking part in activities that     
well  only happen in the movies  
fortunately  the cast of down to you has a certain appeal  
freddie prinze jr  and julia stiles are an adorable couple  and when on screen together  they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around  
zak orth  as the newly realized porn star monk  shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the films intelligent dialogue  
rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy  the faculty   selma blair  cruel intentions  and ashton kutcher  tvs that s shows   
even the fonz himself  henry winkler  the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia  has a welcome role as als dad  the host of the popular cooking program chef ray  
maybe the concept of down to you looked good on paper to draw such a crowd  
as a feature film  however  the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely  
perhaps worst of all  down to you is not funny  
the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired  
the characters on screen  often laughing at each others goofyembarrassing antics  seemed far more amused than the audience  
even the giggly year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run its course  
the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr  in a fantasy sequence called cooks  a cops takeoff in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for  needy families  with the assistance of a fullyarmed swat team  of course   
when this is the highlight reel  you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired  
in order to make a teen comedy work  youve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity  
 things i hate about you actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards  and the result was refreshing  
no such luck with down to you  
its just a textbook romance where  despite absurd circumstances  everything is bound to work out in the end  
and at the end of the whole clich  d ordeal  the nicest thing you could possibly say would be      
only in the movies
