over  years ago  a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira  a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankinds nuclear testing  
partly flight of fancy  partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry  gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  
a year later  gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things  a new name  a dubbed english track  and raymond burr  
as godzilla  the film took on the rest of the world  
thirty years later  toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things  yes  including raymond burr  and called it godzilla   
now its  years after tohos remake  and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run  
in emmerichs godzilla  matthew broderick plays dr  niko tatopoulos  a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiationinduced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms  
when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river  tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states  
meanwhile  tatopouloss college girlfriend  audrey timmonds  maria pitillo   works in new york city as an assistant to a bigtime news reporter  
shed like to be a reporter herself  and when godzilla comes ashore  she figures this is her big break  
of course  with the big guy running amok in the city  niko and audrey are bound to cross paths  and are joined by victor  animal  palotti  hank azaria   audreys trusty cameraman friend  and phillipe roche  jean reno   an operative for the french government  whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place  
together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla  
with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nations premiere movie production companies  one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla  
he didnt  
right up there with the lost world  godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history  
the plot is pretty much what we expect  the big dinosaurlike creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city  and its up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped  while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  
the script  however  is painfully bad  
its fraught with lines so corny  they dont even belong in bmovies  and includes many character actions which make you think   you idiot   or  you stupid girl   
i suppose when youve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york  any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well  
why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them  but is conveniently able to leap atop others  
why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him  when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line  
why do sidewinder missiles  which have small explosive warheads  blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla  
why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f fighterbombers  when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two  
okay  maybe the last one was a bit nitpicky  but hey  i was on a roll  
broderick is usually a good actor  but in this film hes weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way  
hank azaria does what he can  but dont expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage  
like brodericks  azarias character is quite simply lacking in color  
what really annoyed me was maria pitillo  who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting  
casting must have been asleep on this one  
the one bright spot here is jean reno  who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic  quite unlike what weve seem him do in the past  
although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster  reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable  
unfortunately  the same cannot be said of the other incongruities  
the entire feel of the movie is tongueincheek  and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it  
this results in a significant amount of parody  which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster  and ends up just producing a mess  
most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief  and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously  
although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture  what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens  
if we cant take the characters seriously  the threat they face is an empty one because we simply dont care what happens to them  
godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more lighthearted than it should be  
far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters  but heres a behemoth running through the city  
theres bound to be a lot of casualties  but instead godzilla is afflicted with the afterschool g  i  
joe cartoon syndrome  where almost everyone seems to get out of harms way just in time  
in a couple of scenes  godzilla briefly breathes fire  
none of the characters even remark upon this ability  nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers  
its as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes  godzilla can do this  just like in the old movie  
consider another punch pulled  
through creative script writing  you can make a sequel out of just about any movie  but the final scene in this one doesnt just leave the door open  it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently  
it made me want to gag  
emmerich should have done away with  of the humor and injokes and played this one as a straight action film  
with an intelligently written screenplay  godzilla could have been so much more  
however  by confusing the viewer with a ton of addins and parodies  the movie ends up being something that just doesnt work  
now if they only had raymond burr
