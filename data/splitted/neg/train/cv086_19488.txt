lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode   episode  is a boring  empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  
after the familiar a long time ago      
opening  the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game  
the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo  ruled by queen amidala  portman  jedi knights quigon  neeson  and obi wan  mcgregor  are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade  
however  this simple blockade is not all it seems  and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers  including facing the evil darth maul  ray park   
they also meet the future darth vadar  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  
star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking  script  direction and characters  
the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  
the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star  and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent  
theres no underlying tension  and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  
the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story  which doesnt help  
theres no snap to make the film work  it moves at a plod  
the script is boring  all the characters speak in morals  especially anakins mother  
theres no group spirit evident here  and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders  its evident that not much is going to happen  
the two leads are hideously boring  static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  
quigon and obiwan hold no presence on film  and give little for the audience to root for  
the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul  if he had been given more screen time  
maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history  even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film  all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy   
anakin is annoying and unlikeable   
instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended  
its probably not surprising that his hateful little boy  unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows  joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible  
the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks  although in the end none is provided in the film by him  
although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys  the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny  
the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a pod racer  because i knew he wouldnt be able to talk for a while  
queen amidala is a nothing in the film  she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people   and go googoo over anakin  
again  her role will become more important in the later episodes  and is given little to do here  
the actors dont help the movie much either  
liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed  and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible  
mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy  with little charm  
the casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness  theres little other explanation for it  
natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script  but she delivers a spunky performance  
and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice  
theres very little talent evident with him  its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there  
hes not even very cute   
the main claim of the film  the special effects  are okay  
theres nothing impressive about them  yet they complement the story well  
the cgi takes away much of the human element  however  
the battle droids for example  the replacement for the stormtroopers  are characterless little computer graphics  lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers  
episode  is just disappointing  
its got high production values  but little else  
the music is meandering  except near the end  
the plot gives us noone to root for  or even care for  
the effects are nice  but dull  
the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should  
theres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair  and many clich  s are catered for throughout the film  
apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence  episode  is a dry affair that serves little purpose  except to make money and to get us to watch episode  to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film  
disappointing is barely the word
