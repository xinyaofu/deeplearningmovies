based on the s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie  be happy  i wont bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons   this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend boxoffice  after scoring huge successes with men in black     directed by the same man who controlled this one  and independence day     
can you say    the 
third times not a charm  
plot  james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nations top scientists  and threatening to take over the united states within a week  
critique  i did not laugh once during this entire picture  
when you consider that this film is a partcomedy  thats not a very good sign  
i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes  
when you consider that the other  part  of this film is geared as an actionadventure  i would say that this another negative sign  
and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow  the storyline tired  reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving  and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame oneliners  weak characterizations and an anticlimactic end  you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this  big  summer blockbuster  
it blows  
or as they say in french   eet blows   
could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it  
maybe  
could it be that most of the special effects dont show up until the last half hour  and even then  we dont see anything that its trailers hadnt already given away  
perhaps  
or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood bigbudget movies  that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own  
naaaaaaah  
a bad movie is a bad movie  
on a positive note  i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek  who seemed underused  in my humble opinion   and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in  
branagh was also fun as the scenerymunching  overthetop bad guy  but thats pretty much where the entertainmentbuck stopped  
smith and kline were static at best  the plot full of holes  and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others  
i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie  
then again  there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage    huh    oh 
yeah  but the rest of the movie sucked
