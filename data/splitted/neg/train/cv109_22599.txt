nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre   frankenweenie    beetlejuice    batman    edward scissorhands    ed wood    mars attacks   
 yet none of them have been horror films  
  sleepy hollow  is his first attempt to actually scare people  
i greeted the prospect with high anticipation  burtons whole career seemed to be leading up to this  
i left disappointed  
andrew kevin walkers screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story  the legend of sleepy hollow   
in the movie ichabod crane  johnny depp  is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors  
ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders  
several of the towns leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman  
although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him  ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning  
he also discovers that the killings are not random  that the victims are tied together by a secret  
along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching  literally  young woman  christina ricci  and the son of one of the murder victims  marc pickering   
my reaction  hohum  
the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting  
that in itself is forgivable  hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages  
however  burtons attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy  
it might be his background  in his previous movies  goofy was the goal  
along the same lines  it doesnt help that creature designer  and producer  kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongueincheek tales from the crypt tv series  
a witchs eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbits  a tree spurts blood like its in a monty python sketch  and the headless horseman  
  
  
well  hes a guy without a head  
  
  
on a horse  boo    
the performances are also awful  
although hes impressed me with his work in other films  depp doesnt seem to know what to do with ichabod  and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction thats supposed to pass for an th century accent  
ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic  which guarantees that we wont sympathize with her character  
the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish  
the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee  martin landau  and christopher walken  
i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppolas projected series of gothic adaptations  a series that produced only  bram stokers dracula  and  mary shelleys frankenstein   
coppola is an executive producer for  sleepy hollow   and the script reflects his interest in early forms of  moving pictures   particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion  
  theres a bird on one side of the card  a cage on the other  
when the card is flipped rapidly  the bird appears to be caged   
bottom line  the hollow isnt the only thing thats sleepy
