note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their  sciencefiction flick species  
squandering an intriguing premise  the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess  widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike  and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success  raking in over  million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast  ben kingsleys a splendid actor  but a marquee name he aint   
miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film  i doubted that theyd dare tempt fate and go for another round  
so here comes species ii  with a new creative team  director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman  respectively  that fails to improve the series one iota  like its predecessor  species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid  
the film follows the exploits of a young man  patrick ross  justin lazard   whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women  loitering in strip clubs  and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can  
in other words  patrick is like a lot of guys  these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age  but theres a catch  hes an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars  and whos now infected with alien dna  
patricks overriding compulsion  to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring  
and when he becomes aware of eve  natasha henstridge   a halfhuman  halfalien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab  patricks primary focus turns to her   if these two were to mate  the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable  warns dr  laura baker  marg helgenberger  gamely reprising her role  with admirable conviction  
species ii opens with the mars mission  and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokeylooking  even splicing back to dated  grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities  they really skimped on production values this time around  
however  this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick  watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship  any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy bmovie is quickly answered  
mr  brancatos original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches  
like the first film  and perhaps in homage to it   theres a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious  
last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitakers psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room   something bad happened here   
this time  laura gets to stand over a fresh  shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter  this is awful   
and shes not even empathic  
and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefullypaced suspense sequence  eve  whos telepathically linked to her alienhumanhybrid counterpart  whatever   helpfully tells our alienhunting protagonists   hes going to rape her   
while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious  at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own  
theres an amusing  tongueincheek bit of product placement  which doesnt really make much sense  but i appreciated the sentiment   as well as some supermarketrelated hijinx   hes in aisle    
informs eve   
if the film maintained this sort of lighthearted tone  it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch  but  to its detriment  it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody  effectsladened anticlimactic conclusion  
much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense  and there are such gaping plot holes that its terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief  
the implausibilities are endless  what about the toxic bomb in eves brain  
why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual  
my favourite was the slowmotion sequence in the film where eve  sporting superhuman strength  is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks  
this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief  incredulous that its being foisted upon the public  
returning headlines michael madsen  who reprises tough guy press lennox  and ms  helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay  but theres realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis  
mykelti williamson  portraying astronaut dennis gamble  churns out an alltoofamiliar spin on a generic brashmouthed character  and fine character actors george dzundza  playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process  and james cromwell  patricks neglectful father  senator ross  are utterly wasted in the film  
mr  lazard gives his character an appropriately shiftyeyed look  while returning vixen ms  henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene  and acquits herself nicely   but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing  or none at all   
ms  henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series  claiming that  shes so empowered   
a lethal halfalien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion  now  thats  what i call empowerment
