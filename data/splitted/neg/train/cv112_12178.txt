the sequel to the fugitive     u  s marshals is an average thriller using its association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks  
tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard  the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive  
this time  hes after fugitive mark sheridan  snipes  who the police think killed two fbi agents  but of course hes been set up  and when the police plane escort he  and gerard  are riding crashes  he makes a run for it  gerard not so hot on his tail  
what follows is about  hours of action  brought to us by the director of executive decision     another film curiously involving a plane  
when comparing this movie to the fugitive  the prequel is far superior  
but even on its own  u  s marshals is a pretty lousy movie  
while the original was reasonably intelligent  and had a fugitive to root for  the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive  mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time  
while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character  u  s marshals is straight in there  pulling its trump card  the place crash  almost immediately  
to be honest  i couldnt care less if snipes character got captured or not  
snipes performance is average  and his character gets surprisingly little screen time  considering he is the fugitive  for reasons ill explain later  
tommy lee jones is as fine as ever  although his role is hardly a challenge  
the sense of deja vu was overwhelming  
i know its the same role from the fugitive  but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film  
theres a few nudge nudge references from the first film  but apart from that  nothing  
nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie  
downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce whos roped into the chase  and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife  
nobody looks as if their having a good time  and all the performers are on autopilot  
the supporting cast are o  k  but when it comes to performances  u  s marshals falls flat on its face  
it doesnt fare any better plotwise  either  
the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes  but then veers off into terrorists territory  
as said above  the film is an normal  average terrorist thriller  seen a million times before  but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional  
if this film wasnt the sequel to the fugitive  this would probably go straight to video  or not even been made at all  because its so average  
and because of the films plot changing its course  snipes is almost forgotten apart  and hardly features in the movie  
stuart baird  the director  is all right  but theres no particular scene that stands out  
its director is the usual action movie style  
even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension  
the special effects are nice  especially the plane crash  and theres a good  if very loud  soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith  
but in the end  u  s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement  
sure  its loud and dumb  but in the end u  s marshals just aint fun  
bored performers and a lackluster plot and script  do not make a good action movie
