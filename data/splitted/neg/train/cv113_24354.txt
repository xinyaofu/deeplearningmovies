one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris odonnell stars in this remake of buster keatons  silent film seven chances  
now ive never seen seven chances  as im more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan  but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this  
odonnell plays jimmie shannon  the manager of a pool table manufacturing company  
he also fears commitment  and despite dating anne  renee zellweger  for over three years  hes unwilling to marry her  
his reasons  
well hes a guy you see  and well  guys are like stallions  and they apparently dont like to be roped or something  hey  thats the movies explanation    
id marry renee zellweger in a second   
eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose  and when he does  its the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever  
he essentially says to her   you win  and hands her a ring  
the audience should now hate this character  
i did  
then the meat of the plot presents itself  
jimmies grandfather  peter ustinov  completely wasted  dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of  million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business  
however  in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers  jimmie must be married before his next birthday  which is just over  hours away   
having blown his chances with anne  jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a  business proposition   
the movie wasnt half bad by this time  surprisingly  
it wasnt boring me  and even managed to read my thoughts at one point  
ustinovs character left a video will  and while hes reading the ridiculous clause in it  i thought to myself  what is this  brewsters millions    
as soon as i thought it  hal holbrooks character actually says  what is this  brewsters millions   
it was quite surreal  
something happens though during the films final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive  
up to that point  all of jimmies prior girlfriends had turned down his  business proposition  which i felt was good  
at least the film wasnt painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers  
when jimmie has no other options  his goofy friend  played by artie lange  making a career out of playing the goofy friend  places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story  
at this point     women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride  
these women arrive at jimmies location and immediately start bullying him about what hes looking for in a woman  
when hes had enough of their unjustified attacks  he tells the angry mob that theres been a mistake and he wont be marrying any of them  
as a result  the women proceed to chase him around the city  in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off  
this goes on for the rest of the film  
its just chris odonnell running from    obnoxious  greedy  angry and stupid women  
my groans of disgust could be heard for miles  
the film finally ended  thankfully   but to this day im still groaning  
the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video  
it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of       cast and crew info  and special dvdrom features  
the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc  which contains scenes not in the film  
apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing odonnell around the city  and at one point odonnell is leaping from the tops of buses  
so that was bad enough to be cut  but the other  minutes of bride shenanigans was good  
ugh
