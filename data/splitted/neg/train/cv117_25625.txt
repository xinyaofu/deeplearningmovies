what would you do if no one could see you  
well  if youre a super smart biomolecular research scientist working for the military  youd grope a coworker and roughup your neighbor from across the street  
thats right  
of all the noncriminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible  in  hollow man  kevin bacons character opts to commit sex crimes  
er  its kevin bacon who plays the super smart military biomolecular research scientist  
something sounds horribly wrong already  
but this is a paul verhoeven film  and the sleazepin director of such opencrotch classics as  basic instinct  and the infamous  showgirls  never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which  when you come right down to it  is all this film is about  
  hollow man  features a string of hapless  clist actors  among them bacon  elisabeth shue  josh brolin  and kim dickens  in a gradez plot with a lot of special effects that  frankly  dont look much better than those used in the  version of  the invisible man   
oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when hes attempting reentry but otherwise its lots of  thermal  shots and inanimate objects  elisabeth shue included  bobbing around without any visible signs of support  
since invisibility  once achieved  isnt much of an effect  the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each otherit amounts to much of a muchness   the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in looselybuttoned sweaters so that the minute bacons character gets invisible he can head straight for them  
its as if that fascinating conceptwhat would you do if no one could see you  is 
simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin  
as a horror film   hollow man  is unsophisticated and disturbing  in its intent  not its achievements  and not worth your time or your hardearned dollars  
its minor verhoevenand even thats not saying muchand boy is it hollow
