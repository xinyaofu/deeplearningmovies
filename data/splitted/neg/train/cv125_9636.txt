this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation  
but lo and behold  here comes  switchback   and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as  kiss the girls  and  i know what you did last summer   
but  switchback  is an undoubtedly weak genre entry  as the material it covers is old and tired  and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting  
  switchback  opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child shes watching  
we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse  dennis quaid   and that the kidnapperkiller is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while  
he is promptly removed from the case  but this conflict of interest doesnt keep him from offering pursuit  
lacrosses most recent trek takes him to a bloodsoaked hotel room in amarillo  texas  where the local sheriff  r  lee ermey  is torn between his reelection campaign and helping his new ally catch his man  
in a related aside  former railway worker bob goodall  danny glover  is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinupplastered  even on the seatbelts  el dorado  
along the way  he picks up  and subsequently saves the life of  hitchhiking loner lane dixon  jared leto   
this tangent isnt a random one  as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself  
or is the villain in fact lacrosse  only pretending to be after the coldhearted murderer he knows so much about  
in a sense  thats half of the basic problem with  switchback   
for its first hour  the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator  so were given little insight into who they are  likely for fear that well learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction  
but  switchback  then decides to explicitly reveal the killers identity at its midpoint  and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense  
some of the acting is a burdensome area as well  probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves  
what is danny glover doing here  grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot  
and dennis quaid  
  that monotone  stop it   
ermey is solid in a supporting role thats more interesting than the two leads thrown together  but the charismatic leto  claire danes object of affection in  my socalled life   is a scenestealer tried and true  
from a material standpoint   switchback  is pretty empty  
but even when firsttime director jeb stuart  who wrote  the fugitive  and  die hard   doesnt know what to do  he knows what he wants it to look like  the movie provides some great visuals  
the setonatrain climax looks good  even though the action is illogical   and the beautiful  crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor  
still  thats not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond  and more than the movies look will end up leaving you cold
