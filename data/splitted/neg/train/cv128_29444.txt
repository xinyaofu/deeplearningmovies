susan grangers review of  ghosts of mars   sony pictures entertainment  
horror auteur john carpenter   halloween    vampires   strikes out with this scifi ecofable thats so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got greenlit  
the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last years  pitch black   involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from bloodthirsty  marauding aliens  
in the year   there are    earthlings on mars  living in a matriarchal society led by a commander  played by pam grier  
grier  pillpoppin natasha henstridge  and some rookie mars police officers  clea duvall  jason statham  travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch  desolation  williams  thats ice cube  to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder  
but when theyre besieged by demented  zombielike  bodysnatching miners  they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection  
it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and  soon after  most of the miners went bonkers as longdormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies  lopping off heads as  vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet   according to a scientist  joanna cassidy   
carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the  night of the living dead  like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing  
but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed  along with the order of their elimination  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    ghosts of mars  thuds to a laborious  bottomofthebarrel   
perhaps  indeed  there is a curse on mars films  if you recall two other duds   mission to mars  and  red planet
