  showgirls  is the first bigbudget  bigstudio film to receive an nc rating  
and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence  
but if  showgirls  is any indication of hollywoods future  the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american valuesbad moviemaking  
  showgirls  is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene  and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter  
director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas  who collaborated on another shockvalue project  s  basic instinct   follow the plight of a young woman  teen tv star elizabeth berkley  determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer  
its a hackneyed premise to begin with  so not surprisingly  all of the stock characters are trucked out  
theres the demanding producer  
the loyal friend  
the bitchy competitor  
lest i forget the scummy club owner  
of course  any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the films main attractionan endless parade of fullfrontal nudity  
unfortunately   showgirls  doesnt satisfy in this department  
verhoevens slambang  inyourface style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic  
to make matters worse  youll be forced to sit through the movies clothed scenes  which dont cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history  
verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground  but if its adult entertainment you want  stay home and watch the playboy channel  
youll be the wiser for it
