the last line  or near to that honor  is the great butler  alfred  the ubergod  michael gough  saying   i think we need a bigger bat cave   or something to that note  
thats exactly what this film is  too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
its too much to handle in one dosage  
its so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere  scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way  shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
its also the fourth worst in the series  and second worst from joel   
the series has been declining since its stunning debut  followed by the almostasstunning sequel and then the anticlimactic third one  first by joel   
this ones not anticlimactic  i knew it was gonna suck  
its up to joel to make it fun though  
  batman forever  was fun  
this is a big bore of overproduced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean  this one bit  
im gonna put all the plot in one paragraph  mr  freeze  ahnold   whos wife was dying of some disease  has become the new big villain these days  
hes a huge exscientist who fell into some weird liquid  hello  
joker   and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman  george  and robin  chris  fight him a bit but find theyre growing apart  
meanwhile  another villain shows up  poison ivy  uma    who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist  john glover  who kills her when she finds out hes used her research to develop an uberman  bane  who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals  dont ask cause i cant tell ya  as a sexy woman  the real uma  whos poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile  alfreds dying of the same disease mr  freezes wife has  but in an earlier state than she   and his niece  barbara  alicia   comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade  but soon  well  not really soon  it takes her  hours  becomes batgirl  
meanwhile  in an unfinished subplot  bruce  batmans alterego  if you forgot  has been dating the lovely julie madison  the even lovlier elle macpherson  who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population  dont ask      
the trio must team together  as family  to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much  right  
right  
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however  while tim burton nicely balanced the villainbatman storyline  although not wonderfully   joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches  a couple clever lines and thats it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this  i cant even comment on george clooney as batman  i hardly saw the guy  
and when i did  he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them  
hes not quintessential  hes not horrible  hes good  
but im sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since theyll be critically murdered for this sorry effort  well get a good script and clooney will shine  if he still has the job   
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher  
last time  we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brainscomedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey  
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain  the same guy   mr  freeze  
we feel bad for his mentalphysical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants  
arnold isnt very good  too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points  
when he watches old movies of his wife  he actually looks somber  
wow  
but uma makes the most of her seductive character  getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness  
its like shes almost parodying herself in  pulp fiction  at points  
shes incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better  
as for the lower batpeople  chris is the same as he was in  batman forever   although i think his work in these is too hokey when hes best at quieter parts in  scent of a woman  or just plain cool parts in  fried green tomotoes   
alicia  i love the girl but shes not particularly good in this film  
she can hypotheitically act  we all saw that in  clueless   but her lines kinda sound weird  
and it isnt the mushymouth this time  
but in all fairness  she has virtually no part  
joel gets around to her occasionally and when shes on  she does stupid stuff    although 
i know im not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma    
and poor elle  
poor  poor elle  
i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act  for those of us who saw  sirens    
but she has no part    
it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product  
there are no  couch  scenes  like my best friend noticed   
now listen to me on this one  in every  batman  flick  theres a couch scene  
in the original  it was with vicki  
in  returns   it was a good makeout scene with selena  
and in the last one  it was a chat with nicole  
this one  its nothing  
and batgirl does nexttonothing in this film till the end when shes suddenly  part of the family   
fortunately  we get a lot of alfred  
hes the always reliable butler  in case you didnt know  who has been with bruce all his life  
hes a god  
hes a father figure  
hes also dying  
this got to me  
i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe  not in his tux  and freaking dying just gets to me  
we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time    but 
this is never answered  as this film is too cluttered  
but in defense  it does have some good parts  other than uma  
for one  george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do  
and there are some nice touches  
when they show the asylum at one point  they show the patients belongings in a room and we see the riddlers costume  
i laughed  
and during a biker scene  involving robin and batgirl  another subplot never handled past initiation period   we not only see coolio but a bunch of badasses dressed as  droogs  from  a clockwork orange   
i laughed at all these  
the film falls apart around the fiveminute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around  minutes    or 
did it just feel like that  
the film should serve as another in the longline of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays  
people are fed up with stupid films  
thats why the word of mouth killed  the lost world   
thats why last year  indy films grossed more than ever  
thats why this will have a strong boxoffice initative from people who just want to see it  like me  but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it  
thats why the next two bigbudget aciton pics are john woos  faceoff  and barry sonnenfelds  men in black   both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on  
i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste  
i like some of his films   flatliners    a time to kill   but a lot of them suck  
hes a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and thats what makes him great  
but his costuming for woody allens  sleeper  was more interesting than this one  and his costuming was cool  look for the nazi number   
i love the  batman  series  
the first two rocked and i did like the last one  
but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three  
hopefully  this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time  
and maybe theyll get smart and bring back catwoman  
and michael keaton  
but we can only hope
