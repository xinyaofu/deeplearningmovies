deuce bigalow  rob schneider  cleans fish tanks  
yeah  i didnt know that was a real job either  
one of his customers is antoine leconte  oded fehr   a successful gigolo  
when antoine has to go to sweden for three weeks  he lets deuce use his house to look after an ailing  fish  
fooling around  deuce sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a  fish tank  
after taking a try at one of antoines clients and earning   deuce decides to prostitute himself to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fierytempered antoine returns  
enter t  j   eddie griffin   a pimp for  manwhores   who arranges for deuce to service an assortment of women whose imperfections keep them from dating  
theres an enormous woman  played by transvestite porn star chi chi la rue  who hides food in her clothes  
theres claire  gail ogrady  whose narcolepsy causes her to fall asleep every few minutes  
tina  torsten voges  is so tall her face doesnt fit on the screen  and ruth  amy poehler  has tourettes syndrome and shouts obscenities without warning  
finally theres kate  arija bareikis  whose sorority sisters secretly paid her fare  
she seems perfect  and deuce quickly falls in love with her  
  she does  we discover later  have an imperfection  but deuce decides it isnt important   
deuces life is complicated by a bothersome cop  william forsythe  looking for information on antoine and by kates discovery of his manwhoring  
however  neither threat generates much suspense  
the formula is so familiar that we know how it will end from the start  
  deuce bigalow  is the first project from adam sandlers company happy madison  the formation of which assures that well be seeing the sandler style of comedy massproduced at an increasing rate in years to come  
be afraid  
be very afraid  
the good news is that sandler doesnt actually appear in  deuce  and that rob schneider and eddie griffin are funnier than sandler  
schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but goodhearted deuce believable  
griffins delivery is deadon  especially in the coining of  technical terms  for t  j  s profession  as in  dont make me hebitch manslap you   
theres the expected amount of toilet humor in  deuce   
  for one thing  deuces dad is a mens room attendant   
does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny  
for most of us  i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the farside of puberty and discover how funny sex is  
i  for one  will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed  
bottom line   deuce  doesnt offer anything new but it is intermittently funny
