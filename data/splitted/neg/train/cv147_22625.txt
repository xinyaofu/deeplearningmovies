play it to the bone is a punchdrunk mess of a movie  
containing a good cast but awful acting  an interesting premise but terrible execution  ron shelton  white men cant jump  gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two  
rocky no   is vince boudreau  woody harrelson  edtv   a bald  tattooed  newly converted christian  whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word    
something that he has not yet successfully achieved  
rocky no   is caesar dominguez  antonio banderas  the th warrior   best friend of vince who is currently dating vinces exgirlfriend  grace  
both men are nearing the end of their  almost  careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity  
when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated  the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement  
our boys are tapped to fight each other  the winner of which is  promised  a shot at a future title fight  
the film is divided into two sections  
at first  we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes  in graces  sassy grassy  green muscle car  travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day  
along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by  
once in vegas  the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar  
both mr  harrelson and mr  banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past  not that wed know it from their work here  
mr  harrelson is uncomfortably awkward  apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince  
the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable  
mr  banderas is uncharacteristically noncharismatic as caesar  
weak and ineffectual  there is little life in his screen performance  
the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another  
tom sizemore  saving private ryan   robert wagner  austin powers ii  the spy who shagged me   and richard masur  fire down below  are crooked promoters  lucy liu  payback  is a sexstarved hitchhiker looking for a good time  and lolita davidovich  gods and monsters   is the shared girlfriend who cant make her mind up which boxer she prefers  
because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them  the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins  
but even then  because the outcome is so predictably obvious  the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other  
writerdirector ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed  wellchoreographed  welledited  and wellperformed  
if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film  
as it is  the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable  
the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film  
the phrase   play it to the bone is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until youve achieved your desired goal  
that is a biblical principle  
  know ye not that they which run in a race run all  but one receiveth the prize  
so run  that ye may obtain   
 corinthians    kjv 
achieving anything worthy in life requires  playing it to the bone   
we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives  
this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives  
as a movie  play it to the bone is hardly worth our time  
but as a principle of life  the phrase  play it to the bone  are words to live by
