i have no real tangible proof of this  but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script  written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director  then it is actually possible to make a good movie  
using their logic  all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of superfamous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget  
this is the only way i can fathom how th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time  not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre   
now  before i continue to ferociously attack whats wrong with this film  i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller  
catherine zetajones plays virginia baker  an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal  sean connery   
if youve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before  i really dont have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details  the two team up for various jobs  stealing various things for various purposes  
the problem we come to is that weve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesnt break any new ground in the bigbudgethollywoodaction genre  
the result is that the entire production feels contrived  
im going to be completely honest here  pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the runtime was looking at catherine zetajones  
now while this may be a compliment for ms  zetajones  it certainly isnt for either the writers or the director  who are not nearly as clever as they think they are  
just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between  entrapment  and  blackmail   
with an eighty million dollar budget  youd think that entrapment would at least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes or breathtaking special fx  
well  youd be wrong  
the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular  
unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment  die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by   years  
the reality is that after  minutes of watching this picture  you know exactly whats going to happen  despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists  
many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zetajones in extremely tightfitting clothing  
one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laserbeams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask  
nothing wrong with that  but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was  so why didnt she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room  
ill tell you why  because its a great excuse to photograph zetajones posterior as it slides underneath those beams  and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing  the rehearsal   
ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie  and though he has great screen presence  although so do connery and zetajones  and the most interesting character in the film  not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss  a concept i invented just to describe this picture   
one last complaint  entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building  or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot  hell spontaneously disappear in ninjalike fashion  
i can picture amiel patting himself on the back  thinking to himself  itll leave the audience wondering for days  how did he do that   
we know jon  its called editing
