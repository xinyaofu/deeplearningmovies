when i originally saw the trailer for  analyze this  a few months ago  i must admit  i thought it looked kind of lame  
and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago  i thought it looked outright bad  
but then when  analyze this  finally opened a few days ago  an odd thing happened  
it got great reviews  
critics were proclaiming it  hilarious  and a  deadon parody of mob movies   
well  with praise like that  i figured  it must be good and so i headed off to the theater  
you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts  
well  turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for  
  analyze this  is slow  unfunny  and badly acted  
dont get me wrong  i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century  but he is just out of his league here  
i think the problem is he didnt quite know how to approach this material  
he plays his character  mob boss paull vitti  somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama  
if he had played the character straight  along the lines of leslie nielson in the  naked gun  series  he probably would have been a lot more successful  
as it is  though  he plays the character completely serious at some moments  and for laughs at others  
this doesnt work  
it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold  you always know its him  
and the movie is badly paced  too  
it never takes off  
it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum  
i think the blame for this should be placed on the script  
its obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie  mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist  but once this is established  the movie doesnt really go anywhere  
the formula of the film seems to be this  billy crystal says no to deniro  deniro forces him  and much wackiness ensues  
this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie  
ive said it before and ill say it again  the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not its funny  
if  analyze this  had been funny  the pacing and bad acting wouldnt have bothered me  
i would have been too busy laughing to notice  
but as it is  i only chuckled a few times  
the only really funny scene is a deadon parody of  the godfather   
sadly  though  i dont think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody  because i was the only one laughing  
but my sense of humour  i have come to realize  is vastly different from the general population  
i loathed  theres something about mary   yet loved  baseketball   
now  if you want a movie that  i  think is funny  go out and see  office space   
its full of genuine laughs and wont leave you glancing at your watch every  minutes  as  analyze this  did
