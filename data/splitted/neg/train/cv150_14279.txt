jeanclaude van damme movies tend to be  if nothing else  a lot of mindless fun  
his latest film   knock off   skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is  well  simply mindless  
you cant really blame van damme  
no one  i suspect  has ever expected  the muscles from brussels  to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray  
and even his sidekick costar   saturday night live  alumnus rob  makin copies  schneider  does whats expected of him  although neither appear to want the role of straight man  
no  the problem with the film is its direction  
the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible    
and it goes downhill from there  
five hundred characters  it seems  are introduced within the first fifteen minutes  
van damme doesnt land his first kick until after thirtytoo late for most action fansand by the time the hour mark has rolled around  your jaw will be on your cup holder and youll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess  
director hark tsui  whose previous film was the van dammedennis rodman teamed  double team   films at such a frenetic pace that its hard to know whats going on  whos on whose side  and what the point of all this is  
faster than you can yell  fruit stand   
were watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme  
when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a fourfoot eel while enthusing  move your beautiful big ass   the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre  
every now and again  knock off  will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishesinventive camera shots and angles  wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below  revealing cutins within the framebut they all happen too quickly  and within such a furious frame of reference  that theyre wasted  
if only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute  
if youre interested in the plot  youre better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the onscreen shenanigans   jeanclaude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with  nanobombs  hidden in cabbage patch knockoffs  
maybe  
with paul sorvino   
a more accurate summary would be  jeanclaude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large  blatant cocacola product placements   
the fact that the film is staged during hong kongs last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesnt figure in at all  
perhaps  knock off  s most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score  
some of you might remember the mael brothers as the s synth pop duo sparks  their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action  kimono my house  indeed  
like the cheap jeans and  pumma  sneakers manufactured in hong kong  van dammes latest is a real phony
