tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers  all searching for deeper meaning  
however  they wont find much meaning in the real blonde  and not enough real humor  either  
joe  matthew modine  is a struggling actor  or he claims to be one  even though he has no credits under his belt  
his girlfriend  mary  catherine keener  has no pretensions about her career  shes a makeup artist  working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair  marlo thomas  and supermodel of the month  sahara  bridgette wilson   
sahara  who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid  has an onagain  offagain relationship with joes best friend  bob  maxwell caulfield   
however  bob has gotten his biggest break yet  a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly  daryl hannah   who may be that illusive woman hes always pursued  a real blonde  
there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde  but not enough  
the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background  such as saharas perfume ads   depression  its not just a state of mind   
but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel  
and  unfortunately  the films forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic  
take for example the films framing device of an old lady and her dog  
the story serves absolutely no purpose  makes little sense  and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie  
matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film  but theyre stuck in the most boring plotlines  
modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley  who appears as another struggling actor  
keeners character has a stronger edge  but the insult selfdefense class  taught by denis leary  no less  she is stuck in makes little sense  
the movies running time is under two hours  but it seems like it is well over it  
theres just not enough humor to speed things along  and not enough meaning to propel any drama
