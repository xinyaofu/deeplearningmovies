there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space  its just that none of them happen to be actors  
the stars im referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movies  outer space   the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home  
yes  in terms of acting  the star power is  
  
  
well  more like a falling star  
kinda pretty  shortlived  and pretty much dead  
lost in space  as if you really didnt know  is based on the s scifi television series of the same name  
its the year   and earths precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population  
john robinson  william hurt  is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet  
earths entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission  but nobody  whether it be johns family or hired battle pilot don west  matt leblanc   seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years  
johns family consists of his wife maureen  mimi rogers   his atypical teenage daughter penny  lacey chabert   his ingenious son will  jack johnson   and his beautiful scientist daughter judy  heather graham   
despite everyones reluctance  the jupiter  spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space  
unknown to anyone but the audience  there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission  
dr  smith  gary oldman  has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour  and dr  smith has reprogrammed a talking robot to  destroy robinson family   
when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides  the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination  and now the premise of being lost in space is complete  
as for the audience  you will likely be lost in boredom by this point  wondering if the plot  like the jupiter   will ever get off the ground  
its hard to tell who deserves the most blame  the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script  
chabert is basically the only one to overdo it  sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium  
if you  like me  were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens  youre wrong  
thats just her normal voice  
in yet another example of a  friend  faltering on the big screen  leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming  make sense    it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod  
graham is a babe  thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film  
hurt  the black hole of excitement  sucks up any energy that might have been left  
if hurt were available in tablet form  he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill  
johnson isnt dull  hes just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybodys ass all the time  
want an example of how cool this kid can be  
how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family  
hey  dont laugh  the thing actually listened to the mr  rogerswouldbeproud sentiment  
but alas  if you thought a character couldnt be much worse  there was rogers as the epitome of generic  or  mother as she was known   
why hire an actress  
they couldve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it  
now that wouldve had some pizzazz  
lost in space luckily doesnt suffer in every single category that it could have  
the special effects are crisp  clear  and at least mildly captivating  unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman  who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse  
unfortunately  oldman is locked away for most of the film  giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy  
while the special effects are pleasing to the eye  they are nothing you couldnt find in most modern scifi films  
contact  for example  far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination  
lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art  with numerous contradictions  the time travel aspect was horribly flawed    wooden and corny acting  worse dialogue  and an ending so disappointing  youd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens  
then again  with an ending like this film has  its obvious a sequel is already being considered  
what an awful note to end on  knowing there could be more of this in a year or two  
the attempt to be family oriented is commendable  but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups  
well  danger potential movie goers  
danger  
this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity
