watching the movie  i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup  cute n cuddly  computergenerated monkey  
if the monkey died  the movie got an extra half star  
alas  the monkey showed up at the end  unharmed  to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs  
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved  stars  
thats pretty generous  considering the movies camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek  
when will robinson  jack johnson  teaches his pet robot about friendship  you are actually supposed to buy it  
so why such a seemingly high rating  
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage  
first  we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater  
the sound and screen kicked ass  
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did  and i dont necessarily mean that in a good way   
also  there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons  or getting caught up in the movies tension  
i even liked the computergenerated settings  
i usually prefer to see models or sets  but the cg was more detailed than ive seen in a lot of movies  it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities  
also  gary oldman is never a bad actor  even though he is typecast as a villain  
william hurt isnt too bad either  
neither actor had a great role  but their performances were watchable  
and perhaps i shouldnt admit this  but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood  
there is very little swearing or blood  there is a strong moral message  saccharine though it is  there is a bit of romance  whose culmination after  hours is a  real  kiss  no sex   
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six  
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space  but at the time  they were manna from heaven  
that type of moviemaking is a lost art  
now for the bad news  
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue  
its squeakyclean  family fun  trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction  
  you better hold on to your joystick   is one such line  
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs  they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign  
second worst  and closely related  is the screenplay  
the storys exposition takes place at a press conference  which allows the writers to explain whats happening with the least amount of creativity  effort  or interest  
once the story gets going  i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while  but on the whole  the situations that arise are silly and contrived  
when gary oldman easily reprograms wills pet robot to kill the robinsons  my friend summed it up perfectly   he flipped the switch to evil    
then theres the tone of the movie  
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson  
then it could be an adventure movie  
theyre mostly right  except that johnson  will  wasnt a good enough actor to carry it off  
still  that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination  
just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesnt mean that we have to bow to a  promise keepers  notion of whos the center of a family  
many quality family films have been made with a nontraditional family structure  fly away home comes to mind  to much better effect  
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie  
in star wars  the rebels were the good guys  
we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system  
in lost in space  the rebels are the bad guys  a terrorist force that must be killed  crushed and silenced so that our children may live free  
that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists  
finally  a few specific details deserve criticism  
the movie tells us that the setting is the year   
why  
why bother saying what year this is  
just tell us its the future  
i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in   
setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it wont be timeless  not that this movie was really in the running anyway    
then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole  
this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunnys barber chair  and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers havent learned a thing about ergonomics  
one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed  it made lost in space look cool  
the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and  out of context  made it sound hip  
this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie  
but if thats the best part of the movie  i cant in good conscience recommend it  
still  if you get stuck seeing it  as we did  you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance  think of liking bad movies as a child  and bring along your  bad movie bingo  cards
