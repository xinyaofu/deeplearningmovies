i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night  but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies  
luckily  my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta  
i knew it was going to be a bad print with only halffaces and poor sound quality  but i couldnt help myself    
i got it  
well  after watching it  it indeed was a bad print  i was glad i didnt dish out  to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie  
this movie really sucks  
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy   
for example  how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days  
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail  
the songs are bad  the acting is bad  especially deepti bhatnagars   and the direction is the worst of all  
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up  
i didnt even finish the movie    
i couldnt take it anymore  
note  but if anyone out there liked aatish  by the same director   i guess youd like this movie  
its practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff  
aditya panscholi is the sidekick again  
  i was going to give it a zero  but i personally like jackie shroff  so i loosened up a little  
he looked fresh  wore good clothes  as always   and his performance  even though it wasnt his best  was the only saving grace of the movie
