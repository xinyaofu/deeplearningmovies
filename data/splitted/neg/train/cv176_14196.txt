hello kids  
today the movie studios want to take over my critical review  and somehow persuade you that armageddon  the summers biggest blockbuster  is a film for everybody  
and remember  if a film is for everybody  and if it makes the most money for the summer  it must be good  right  
armageddon is a comedy  with a capital  c   
it stars bruce willis  who has a hundred oneliners  
it has a tiny rock land directly in the middle of a heated argument in new york city   
and  chuckle  chuckle  one of those new yorkers  survives  with charcoal all over his face   
snorkle   sniff   hiccup  
and it has steve buscemi as a genius who wants to work for an oil rig  
kneeslap   
isnt this just so  so  funny   
armageddon also has romance  with a capital  r   
it has a tender moment between  forbidden lovers  ben affleck and liv tyler  with  with  animal crackers  
and it has will patton as a long lost husband trying to reunite with his separated wife and child  who thinks hes a salesman  
gurgle   sniff   awwwww  
and it has steve buscemi spewing more oneliners about minors and strippers  
umm  moving right along    
armageddon also has lots of action  with a capital  a   
not just any action sequence would do  
it must have original action sequences that are designed to thrill  
like  drill  darn it  drill    
and  lets have inept people destroy the mir space station   
cant you hear your heart beating   
and steve buscemi goes crazy and starts shooting at people   
what drama   
lastly  armageddon is out there to save the planet  with a capital  p   
this cant be any old thrillerwe must have an asteroid  the size of texas head straight for earth   
and  and  we must have beautiful scenic worldwide shots  like paris  blown up  
and  and  we must have peoples of all colors  nations  and religions  join hand in hand for one final  hopeful  hug  
the final sequence  where muslims in prostrate worship stand upin domino fashionto cheer the victory  filled me with such emotional goo that i wanted to  to  to rip the screen into shreds   
i mean  i mean  cheer for ecstatic joy  
  it was over   
comedy   c   
romance  
  r   
action  
  a   
planet  
  p   
okay  kids  what does that spell  
seriously  folks  
any film that could take the indiefilms most valuable talents  and throw it all away with a bruce willis vehicle  a hundredmillion dollar budget  but have cheapo sets and lousy special effects  is  bottom line  living proof that hell exists  and has made a multipicture deal with universal  
in the midst of all the action  the terseness  the oneliners  the fake sets  the overall waste of time  i recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician   malloy  give me a reading    
remember him  
he was a principal player in last years in the company of men  a film that was more powerful  shocking  terrifying  funny  and shocking than armageddon could ever aspire to be  
armageddon cost over  million to make  
itcom cost a paltry     
need i say more
