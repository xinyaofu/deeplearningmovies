  goodbye  lover  sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may  and one look will tell you why  
its a mess  
and thats  way  before ellen degeneres shows up  
the film is one of those torrid doubleindemnity crime stories that  in this case  required the services of three screenwriters  
i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller  one wrote a murder mystery  and one wrote a comedy  then director roland joff  tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment  
i didnt laugh at ellen degeneres much  i think i was supposed to   
degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse  a toughtalking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair  
either degeneres is wearing a wigas most of the actors appear to beor she doesnt yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist  
every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip  but her incessant wisecracking is poorlywritten and merely stupid  
her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is  at least she died healthy   
and thats one of her wittier asides  
degeneres sgt  
rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of    wait  
to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triplecrosses  
its best described this way  
sultry sexpotreal estate agent sandra dunmore  patricia arquette  is married to jake  a  creative yet unfocused   and alcoholic  advertising rep  played by dermot mulroney  
sandra likes to act out her deepseated sexual fantasies and jakes brother ben  the suaveasever don johnson  likes to help  
ben is also coming on to his petite  mousy coworker peggy blaine  marylouise parker  and someone  somewhere  is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his  
the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again  
although there are some genuine surprises  the plot twists get too contrived too quickly  
probably around the time degeneres gumcracking gumshoe appears  
at least the former  ellen  star is going for something a little different  
arquette turns in yet another of her stilettoheeled  platinum blonde bombshell roles  see   lost highway    true romance   while quoting embarrassing lines like  im not wearing any underwear   
i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this  
heres an example of some of the films flatout stupidity  
sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the films duplicitous lovers  
she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite  the sound of music  on her car stereo  intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims  
so what was the point of the wig and the car  
  the sound of music  stuff might be a reference to  the wizard of oz  allusions in david lynchs  wild at heart   but if so joff  must have forgotten that  wild at heart  was a despicable movie  
its hard to believe that  goodbye  lover  was directed by the same person who made  the killing fields  and  the mission   
its not  however  hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long  
it should have stayed there
