its always a bad sign when the core audience of a film  children  are either walking out early or are halfasleep when the credits roll at the end of a film  
that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of  dalmatians  a cold pea soup of cute animals  stupid home alone antics  a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans  and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression  
indeed  walt disney is rolling over in his grave again  cursing john hughes name for making the original liveaction  dalmatians  one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time  and now its sequel  
the main culprit behind the hideousness of  dalmatians is its predecessor   dalmatians  
the original made more than  million dollars at the box office  spawned a torrid collection of  collectible  items that ended up months later in the discount bins of walmarts across the country  and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas  
well  its been about four years since then  and dalmatian fever is coming back  and this time its digitally enhanced  
heres the story  
cruella de vil  glenn close  is released from prison due to the  cure  of her puppy homicide urges by one dr  pavlov  
  oh  how witty   
she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer  who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film  
cruella then becomes ella  dog lover  until the plot twists  like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck  and she becomes the evil vixen again  
a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat  but she now needs  dalmatians instead of the commonly used  dalmatian formula  
at this point  i was envying those kids filing out of the theater  
how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu  as the films villain  sunk in the film business  
its almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon  
and depardieu    
how can a french guy have a bad french accent  
and never mind the toilet brush haircut  
the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent  courtesy of eric idle  that thinks hes a rottweiler  
now thats funny
