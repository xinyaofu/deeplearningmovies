romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant  
with director peter medak  whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays  and topnotch character actors gary oldman and lena olin  they seemed likely to be a successful combination  
those mentioned films  however  brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not  a solid  wellwritten screenplay  
call me cynical  but the jobs of writer and producer dont seem to mix well  
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi  a good cop turned bad  selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife  
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname  although the name doesnt provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character  
jack has become addicted to  feeding the hole   a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money  
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot  he feebly attempts to get out  
gary oldmans performance is disappointingly weak  he seems nearly bored  
in the process  he also gets tangledup with mona demarkov  a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone  played adequately by roy scheider  
demarkov  played by lena olin  is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world  
this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator   i cant remember seeing a character quite like her  
after being shot  handcuffed  and thrown in the back seat of a car  she still manages to cause an accident  kick out the windshield with her legs  grab a suitcase full of money  plus some important documentation   climb through the rubble  land on her shot leg  and still succeed at running for safety  
what a woman  
lena olins performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film  
anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeos wife  
there is little insight into her character  
shes depressed  she makes obvious references  she mopes around the house  
juliette lewis  as romeos girlfriend  is treated with the same cliche attitudes  although ms  lewis portrayal certainly didnt improve it  
both women were anything but sexy or attractive  
poorly developed characters aside  the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems  
it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character  not  to do something  
for example  jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scopeout the mob scene  
fine  
jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite  
fine  
what does jack proceed to do  
he brushes his friends off by telling them he isnt feeling well  then strolls over to the boss  
why  
the boss had all ready threatened him  falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jacks toes by the gravesite  
i guess they werent worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral     
or heres another  demarkov setup her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw  
she proceeded to set the place on fire  
wouldnt the flames burn off the fingerprints  
arent dental records more important  
as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be  couldnt she come up with a better plot  
  and it took her no time at all to get a goodfitting  functional prosthesis   
lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film  
this film doesnt even add up the large details  
there is little or no consistency in the storyline  
not much makes sense  
the direction lacks cohesion  surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable  
the moods shift  the styles shift  and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one  
so while it certainly isnt reservoir dogs  it certainly isnt diva  
theres plenty more to tear apart in this film  
my advice to someone who hasnt seen it to to wait until it comes on video  
there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously  
its not a boring film  just not a good one  
or an intelligent one
