after enduring mariah careys film debut  glitter  im reminded of a bit from chris rocks bigger and blacker  
in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man  rock says   you can drive a car with your feet  but that dont mean it should be done   
to that i say  you can give mariah carey a movie  but that certainly dont mean it should be done  
sure  there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there  from the beatles a hard days night to the spice girls spice world  but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter  
everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous  
start off with the story  which  as gruesomely predictable as it is  is the least offensive part of the movie  
the film is inexplicably set in the s  a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers  
worse yet  everyones speaking late s hiphop slang in what should be   
meant to be partially autobiographical  carey plays billie frank  a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother  
influential club dj julian dice  a  k  a   lucky    max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro   hears her sing on a track  and decides to make her a star  
in predictably rapid succession  billie and dice fall for each other  she starts hitting it big  dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass  and suddenly billies on  the roller coaster of superstardom   
in the meantime  billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom  
i wont give away the ending  but  honestly  just think of unicorns and rainbows    
youll figure it out  
the movie screams to be made with camp  and that couldve been fun  
but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better  
what a mistake  
the brief attempts at comic relief  as in a scene where an effeminate russiansounding director gets wacky with filming billies first music video  go over like lead balloons  
instead  the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariahs most dramatic scenes  
which brings us to the performances  of which theres nothing good that can be said  
mariah is primarily seen with a wideeyed deerintheheadlights look frozen on her face  
she actually looks scared during her one love scene  
but you have to wonder if the writing isnt even worse  
so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for careys virginal target audience that its probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb  
even the characters couldnt have been written more absurdly  
theyre all members of a barbie playset  the important film director who swoons   billie  id love to put you in a movie im making   and the bigtime record executive who takes billies demo tape and says   oh  ill make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning   
everyone in the film is a device  and its painful to keep watching just to see another one appear  
to say more would be a waste  
theres so much wrong with this film  
and  it pains me that mariah carey  with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days  as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays  will have to suffer through all the negative reviews shes likely to get  
but  then again  i had to suffer through her movie
