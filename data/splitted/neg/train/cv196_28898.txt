susan grangers review of  americas sweethearts   columbiasony  
what a waste of a talented cast  
billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan have concocted a sly  provocative premise and  as the opening credits roll  its obvious that theyre attempting an oldfashioned romantic comedy  
the story involves a veteran publicist  billy crystal  who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director  christopher walken  holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room  refusing to show it to anyone  
he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the films oncemarriedbutnowestranged stars  gwen and eddie  catherine zetajones  john cusack   theyll be so distracted that they wont remember they didnt see the movie or it wasnt what they expected  
  and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony criticdavid manning quote scandal   
for help  he turns to gwens personal assistantsister  julia roberts   
but the laughs are few and farbetween  
crystals glib  cynical flack isnt wickedly funny enough with a few amusing oneliners  
after six months under the care of a depak chopralike guru  alan arkin   cusacks characters too emotionally fragile  lacking the necessary charisma  
zetajoness vain  narcissistic diva is undeveloped and onedimensional  
only hank azaria  as zetajoness muchmacho spanish lover  and stanley tucci  as a studio exec  and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth  
basically  we dont like these egodriven  stereotypical characters  let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements  and joe roths direction is predictable  formulaic and telegraphic  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    americas sweethearts  is a contrived  shallow   as a screwball satire  its strictly superficial
