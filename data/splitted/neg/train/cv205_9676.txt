the second serialkiller thriller of the month is just awful  
oh  it starts deceptively okay  with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work  
after a babysitter gets gutted in the suit ably spooky someonesinthehouse prologue  parallel stories unfold  the first involving a texas sheriff  r  lee emery   a gruesome double murder  and the arrival of a morose fbi agent  dennis quaid  on the eve of voting for the local lawmans reelection  
the second pairs a hitch hiker  jared leto  with a friendly former railroad worker  danny glover   
theyre headed west  toward the rockies and away from the murder scene  
which one is the killer  
well  it doesnt really matter  cause when writerfirsttime director jeb stuart  die hard  finally spills the beans  you wont take his choice seriously anyway  
the whole thing goes south about an hour in  with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldnt follow  
and through the whole thing theres quaid  playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea gal  
i guess im glad that i didnt walk out theres some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr  
strangelove
