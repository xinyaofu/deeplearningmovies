this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup  and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film  
no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story  
however  even if one thinks of it as fiction   the prince of egypt  remains shallow  
but ill begin from the beginning  
the biggest difference between the original  biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible  whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero  
maybe its just me  but if i knew i had god on my side  id have a little bit more confidence  
there are other differences as well  such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoahs death like its nothing but a thing  
most of all  though  the storys focus has shifted  
rather than being a story about fatherson  manethnicity  mangod   the prince of egypt  is almost solely about the brotherbrother relationship between rameses and moses  
i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie  where it came off as maudlin  
rameses and moses squabble like children and then  in the interests of peace  moses saves rameses butt  even though moses was the one who started it    
  yawn  i didnt care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer  which  of course  never happened in the original story  moses was exiled   
but enough about the differences  
lets talk about the movie itself  
it features a moses who  in the interests of making the character more human  lacks any divinity whatsoever  which isnt convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is  
it features a cookiecutter  iwannapleasedada  rameses  who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes  from schindlers list  among other things   
the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the  newimproved  miriam  voiced by the everantsy sandra bullock  even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason  here bullock is replaced by a singing voice   
speaking of which  it contains  very  annoying music  
it contains shallow writing  
it features extraordinary animation  which is one good thing i can say about this film  
most of all  it contains an attempt to commercialize  homogenize  and massmarket a story about a manifestation of god  
i am not christian  but i got the impression of blasphemy  
the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chopchopped into the story
