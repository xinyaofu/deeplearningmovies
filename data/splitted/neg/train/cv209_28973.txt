  i would appreciate it if you didnt do that again

its no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another  
when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission  there is no problem with this  as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners  
when they arent  well  were in bad shape  
kiss of the dragon  jet lis second consecutive american misfire  plays like one big miscalculation  and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment  
now before i start getting emails angrily touting the genius of jet li  let me explain myself  
li is as spectacular as ever here  and i dont think anyone would ever dare call his martialartsstar skills into question  
the problem isnt with him  its with the movies tone  
the much touted fightscenes here are filmed with such unflinching  unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch  
theyre joyless  perfuctory  lis rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero  a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton  
but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side  
the plot isnt relevant  but if youre curious  its some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer  li  sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police  tcheky karyo   who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever  
oh yeah  and lis character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain andor kill at the touch of a needle  
  kiss of the dragon  is the name of an acupuncture maneuver  in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victims neck  somehow redirecting all of the bodys bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately  
theres a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute  whose daughter is being held hostage  for some reason  by the villain  
this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen  even worse than the one in pearl harbor  
theres no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it  its only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boymeetsgirl subplot  
kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson  whose screenplay the messenger  the story of joan of arc  for all of that films flaws  was at least thoughtful  
i dont know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck  but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic  
i suppose you could call this mainstream  but ill choose the bizarre any time of the day  
if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling  you need a story to justify watching them  
the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy  
no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling  but i hear rush hour  is coming in just a few weeks
