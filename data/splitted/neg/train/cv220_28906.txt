at the outset of swordfish  john travoltas gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today  
basically  he says  it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers  
how ironic  as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture  
swordfish is loud  violent and amoral  
it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life  
and how does travoltas gabriel plan to do this  
by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to outterrorize terrorists  
swordfish is a very cynical movie  
it relies on an audiences perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as nonhuman  faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration  
the movies plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down  youd actually see how ridiculous it all is  
this is a liveaction road runner cartoon  moving so quickly that its over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions  
the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson  hugh jackman   recruited by gabriel to crack the governments computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his antiterrorist campaign  
talk about whackedout patriotism  
my objections to swordfish are many  
the body count is high  but that is expected in a movie of this sort  
its becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers  police officers and government agents blown to bits  
another example is the family dynamics between stanley  his yearold daughter and his exwife  
stanley  though having served time in prison for hacking  is shown as a loving and caring father  forbidden by his ex to see his little girl  
audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husbands adult films  
thus when she is found murdered late in the movie  neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve  
in fact  subconsciously  many in the audience are probably glad she was killed  
then there is the sequence involving one of gabriels henchman holding a gun to the head of stanleys daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel  
children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich  in recent films  
there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them onscreen victims as well  
yea  its only make believe  but that doesnt mean you have to tolerate it  
travolta is cool  deadly charming and flamboyant as the nearcrazy gabriel  
his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and faceoff  
jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings  
his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database  
his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate  
halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriels assistant  while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel  
swordfish plays like a comic book with a largerthanlife character in gabriel  
viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain  
and maybe that is the movies underlying flaw  there is no real hero to speak of  only those doing their upmost to survive  
and that is not enough  
this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water
