its probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre   the matrix    existenz   would collide with the even more popular serialkiller genre   kiss the girls    seen    
the result should have been more interesting than  the cell   
as the movie opens  therapist catharine deane  jennifer lopez  treats a catatonic boy  colton james  by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique thats never fully explained  
after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert  catharine has no success to report  
meanwhile  killer carl stargher  vincent donofrio  has claimed another victim  
his particular hobby is to kidnap young women  keep them in a glass cell overnight  and drown them  
he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach  then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning  
although carls been doing this for awhile  hes recently become sloppy  and fbi agent peter novak  vince vaughn  is closing in fast  
not fast enough  though  to keep carl from sticking another woman  tara subkoff  in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma  
from the videos in carls house  peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction  
to save the kidnapped girl  peter has to find the cell before the end of the day  and comatose carls not talking  
so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carls mind and find out where the cell is in time  
the focus of  the cell  in on the ornate interior of carls mind  but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computergenerated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality  
for the most part  its style without substance  
in his own mind  carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes  ming the merciless  as well as a frightened boy  jake thomas  abused by his father  
all in all  the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place  and i kept wishing i could fastforward to the next development  
singh is best known for directing music videos  particularly rems  losing my religion   and  the cell  seems very much like a really long  really slow mtv video with the sound deleted  
singer lopez seems to think shes in a video as well  she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting  
the premise had great promise  
the computergenerated world within carls mind could have been a bizarre  surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic  
the first room catharine enters in carls head shows this promise  
she finds a horse standing in center of the room  suddenly  sheets of sharpedged glass fall into the horse  dividing it into segments  
the panes of glass separate  pulling apart the pieces of the stillliving horse  
this scene is twisted  disturbing  and thoughtprovoking  because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder  
another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath  
their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie  and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharines own psyche  
like sidney lumets  the offence  or michael manns  manhunter    the cell  could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator  
however  catharines character is hardly developed at all  and lopez has no depth to offer the role  
bottom line  dont get trapped in this one
