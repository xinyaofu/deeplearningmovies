plot  a rich guy who doesnt believe in love  orders a mailorder bride for himself  
that very evening  the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter  
but whats this  
one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be  
wow    a 
sin  indeed  
critique  easily one of the worst movies that ive seen all year  
too long  too boring  too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie  
what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing  
  its no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year  this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week  with some nudity stuffed in from time to time  just to wake up the audience  
have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies  one that you just couldnt help but switch back to from time to time  just to make sure that it wasnt part of some sick joke  
well  this movie is exactly like that  only it isnt a joke  it isnt on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it   
i say again    what the shite were they thinking  
okay  so where do i start  
first of all  the trailer of this film gives away the movies main plot twist  the betrayal  
so for the first half hour of the film  youre basically just sitting there  watching these two  lovers  go through the motions until the  betrayal  occurs  
whoopee  big surprise  
second of all  angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part  
why  
well  its like this  not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman  
i mean  its like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining  well  the same goes here  
every look in jolies eyes screams  psycho   
then of course  you have the case of the  patsy  husband  a man who just cant seem to figure out anything in time  
i mean    how 
boring is that for the audience  
youre watching this guy screw up time after time after time  and somehow  were supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude  
no  thanks  
and if we dont care about him  and we really dont care about her  shes a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film   who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film  
well  ill tell you  
the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not id actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled  
no suspense  no chemistry between the leads  no real love or passion  no sense of surprise  plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending  
so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points  
well  its actually pretty simple  
i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score  but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolies boobies  thats two points right there   and another one for antonios ass  hairless  just for the record   
everything else in this movie was pointless  boring and just plain stupid  
try imagining a softporn movie    but 
without the plot  
thats pretty much what youve got here  
a low point in the careers of both stars  
oops  i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue    god 
oh mighty    make 
it stop   
wheres joblo coming from  
american psycho     cruel intentions     eyes wide shut     fatal attraction     playing by heart     under suspicion     what lies beneath     what women want     whipped
