not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie  
earlier this year  nora ephron wrote and produced one of the years least likeable  comedies  called hanging up  featuring a bunch of annoying women  ironically  lisa kudrow played one in that film as well  who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves  
ick    real 
sweet stuff  
but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer  with a film entitled battlefield earth  
i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film  even if it was on a  cheese  factor  as everybody  and i mean everybody else  pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time  
yipes    another 
beauty  
so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie costarring the everversatile lisa kudrow  
uhhhm  you guessed it    not 
much  
plot  in order to escape major financial difficulties  a local weatherman hooks up with his ballpicking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery  
but as more and more people find out about their scheme  more and more people demand a part of their winnings  and more and more problems arise  
critique  simply stated  i didnt laugh once during this entire picture  
for a comedy  it offered me a few smiles  a bunch of nincompoops as characters  a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow  in what can only described as a  sluttier  version of her character of phoebe on tvs  friends   
this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be  but it was pretty close  
thankfully  the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits  dancing as the weatherman were left in the films trailer  and not in this final cut  
and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far  beautiful  this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic  idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast  
foremost was travoltas character  who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie  
and for me  the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong  
he didnt fit the part  
i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role  
a cool  calculating roughneck with a certain hip  suave  je ne sais quoi   
in this film  he looks like hes trying to be funny  trying to be bad  trying to be good  
were not supposed to be able to notice that  and when we do  at least in my case  i consider it a wrong choice in casting  
add that to lisa kudrow  boring us with yet another one of her patented  dumb blonde  routines  but this time  dressed in sexier outfits  
michael rapaport  stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isnt quite up at the same speed level as everyone else  
and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells  and youve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize  
the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually halfinteresting and never really bored me  
i also liked michael moores perverted cousin character  and i loved  and i say it again  loved the character that bill pullman played  
give this dude his own movie  
he played a lazy cop  a man who tries everything not to do any real work  
he fakes injuries to get off duty  tries to avoid arrest situations so that he wont have to fill out any forms    now 
theres a base of humor  
sadly  the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film  
and theres not much else i can say about this movie  folks  
on the whole  it was lame  included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines  and very little of interest for any target audience  
but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and im there
