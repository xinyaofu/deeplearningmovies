first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating its been given  
for those of us who havent read the james lee burke novel that heavens prisoners is based on  do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts  feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps  gangsters with louisiana accents  plots  subplots  more plots  and well  really just want to see teri hatcher naked  this is one movie youre going to worry the price of admission over  
hopeful still  
well  let me share my moment of sheer panic  and then the cold enervation of the big letdown when a semirobed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin   what do you think of my butterfly    
butterfly   
i asked myself  what butterfly   
and then it hit me    
the scene had been snipped  
damn you  godless pg rating  show us her butterfly   
we want to see the goddamn butterfly    
so    
no naked teri hatcher  
forget about that  
okay  
now    
heavens prisoners is about exalchoholic excop dave robicheaux  alec baldwin  whos trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving  downtoearth wife annie  kelly lynch   
everything dull  but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while theyre on their boat  
the plane nosedives into the water and sinks  but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixiefaced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt  
what they dont realise is that the planes pilot was also a drug dealer  and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latters erstwhile colleagues  
when robicheaux discovers this  he predictably  against the advice of his wife  a wellmeaning dea agent  and two gangsters who rough him up  begins poking his nose where it dont belong  we know that the man deserves all the misery hes going to get  
the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious  meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide  
as dave robicheaux  alec baldwin is fat    
no seriously  this is not the svelte  thinking mans hero of the hunt for red october  it is an outofshape guy who doesnt look too good in a rooftop chasing scene  
hes also unconvincing in the movies dramatic moments  acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segallike economy of expression  
threequarters of the way through the show  while youre probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle  getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up  youll want to beat on him a little yourself  
on the other hand  mary stuart masterson  some kind of wonderful  fried green tomatoes  benny  joon  cast as a downandout stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air  with just the right mix of cynicism  warmth  insecurity and humour to be the movies only endearing character  
eric roberts as bubba rocque  always believable as the womanabusing bad guy who knows how to box  see final analysis  coincidentally also directed by phil joanou  is believable here as the womanabusing bad guy who knows how to box  
and lest we forget teri hatchers role in all this  this being her rather wellpublicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tvs  adventures of lois  clark     
she is totally ridiculous as rocques manipulative and seductive cajun wife  coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair whos trying to get back at an employer who hasnt been giving her enough days off  
its probably safe to say that her day job beckons  
and at the end of our day  none of this is really worth  hrs and  minutes of our personal misery  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
