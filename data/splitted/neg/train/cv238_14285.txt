first troy beyer wrote the critically panned  b  a  p  s   
now she makes her directorial debut  writing  directing  and starring in this subpar film about women talking about sex  
though not without redeeming qualities  this film is bad  
the basic story follows three single friends  jazz  beyer   lena  randi ingerman   and michelle  paget brewster   in their search for love  
jazz has an idea for a local talk show  it would feature women talking about sex and dating  
she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami  
the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout  both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters  
the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film  
there are several moments of bad acting  corny dialogue  and emotional overextension  
in a lowbudget independent film from a firsttime director  these faults can sometimes be forgiven  if the screenplay is fresh and solid  
that is not the case here  
the script suffers from random plot developments  
there are four or five of these turns in the plot  each one raising the question  where did that come from   
at one point  a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother  
we are supposed to be moved  but since the scene is completely unledup to  we really dont care if she and her mother get along  
weve never seen her mother before  
we never see her again  
who cares  
whats worse  these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy  
at another point  a character announces that she cant have children  
apparently  this is devastating  
we wouldnt know this because she never talked about having kids before  but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her  
the scene feels like an afterthought  its emotion manipulative and shallow  
these scenes grow worse and worse  culminating in an absurd climax  
two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing  
one scene is a lovers spat between two minor characters  
the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax  
thinking on these scenes  it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities  
but it does  
first  it is original  
we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups  and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea  
its something i dont think has been the subject of a film  
second  the interviews of the miami women are sincere  
taken together  they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners  
the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes  but each tile is some womans real experience  
neither the picture of women  nor their picture of men  is truly representative  but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way  
at some level  the stereotypes that emerge can be called true  
i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their  likes  dislikes  skills  and thrills   but on the whole  its pretty bad  
and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting  corny dialogue  and emotional overextension  
ill give beyer one more strike  and then shes out  
rated r  almost got an nc  for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity
