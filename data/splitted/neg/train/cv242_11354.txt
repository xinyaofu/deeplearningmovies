  spice world  is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls  
sure theres a hint of humor in there every once in a while  
actually  theres a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls  
but overall  who cares  
not me  
if you dont know by now  the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power  yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood  
in  spice world  they ride around in their big tour bus  whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews  
amazingly  all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things  things they want to do  not things they are required to do to keep earning money  
and they keep babbling about  girl power  when they should really be talking about  cleavage power   
i mean  if all it takes is girl power  then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits  
the film is pg  but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions  youd have yourself one raunchy adult film  
by the way  theres something in the opening credits which says  based on an idea by the spice girls   
wow  they got idea credit  
i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood    
giving credit for simply having the thought  say girls  lets make a movie   
the supporting cast fares well  
roger moore  the real james bond  mockingly plays the clichespewing  chief  of the spice girls  and darn it all  hes fun to watch  
mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the bands manager  richard e  grant   
one question though  george wendt  
youd think that  spice world  would envoke one of two reactions in people  
if you like the spice girls  youll like them even more afterwards  
and if you cant stand them  like me   then  spice world  will really make you sick  
oddly  the audience i saw the film with  roughly  twelve yearold girls  sat in silence for the entire film  
well  not the two who sat directly behind me  
they kept muttering  this is stupid  over and over again  
maybe there is hope for humanity after all
