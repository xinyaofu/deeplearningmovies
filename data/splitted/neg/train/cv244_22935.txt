i should have known  damn it  i should have known  
ewan mcgregor  codename   eye   is pointing a hightech riflely gadget at a fat  bald businessoriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street  
we get the requisite electrogreen throughthesight view  
we the audience  seeing a high tech riflely gadget  of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target  but instead  he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy  lowquality photographs  which eye then proceeds to fax and email to everyone in his targets office  
all right  so thirty seconds in  i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless riflecamera  but i was still open minded    
maybe theres a really good reason for it  
ive got reason to believe  you see  i admire a lot of ewan mcgregors previous work    
and hes obi wan ke frigginnobi for gods sake  
and director stephan elliots last movie priscilla  queen of the desert was a quirky little delight  
theres some genuine talent involved here  
i think at the twenty minute mark  there was still a spark of hope in my heart  
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organizations son  i still have no idea what this organization was  british intelligence  
national spy ring  
private investigation    who is apparently stealing from his trust fund  
he has received his assignment from k  d  
lang  through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase  
when eye tracks his target to an expensive looking secluded house  he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman  ashley judd  take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard  
ok  thats odd  i think to myself  this could be interesting  
then she starts to cry  and through her tears exclaims  merry christmas  dad   
for the first time  
so begins our tale of obsession    
or    something  
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregors eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states  totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar  
throughout his entire professional life  he has been a voyeur  so when he falls for someone  the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras  
fine  thats a lovely premise  i suppose  
but gosh darn it  if youre going to go there  you better have some sort of explanation  
and thats precisely where this film fails  
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off  
its an abortion  a collection of halfformed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end  
it pretends it is something that it is not  a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a hightech thriller  
here  the filmmakers have confused  surreal  and  deep  with  vaguely unclear  and  crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors   
i never  even for an instant  had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in  love  with this woman who changes wigs and kills people  
the movie offers only two explanations  neither of which make a lick of sense  
explanation number one  the obnoxious presence of eyes imaginary daughter  who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago  tells him he shouldnt leave ms  judd  
explanation two  which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie   beauty is in the eye of the beholder   
whoo hoo  that helps  thanks a bunch  case closed  
thats as deep as it gets  folks  
there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes  which  instead of tying everything together  ends up being as profound as a clever sixthgrade mad lib  
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was  
my personal favorites include  the prisonmatron modeled after austin powers frau farbissina  who apparently taught ms  judd everything she knows about wearing wigs  jason priestleys awfully played dirty desert vagrant   who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet  but fails miserably  and the copwhoseesashleyfleeinganaccidentsceneand thenwantstopayforsex butisshot  
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last  
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space  
any time one of the frequent location changes occurs  the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe  and minutes  weeks  or years could have passed  
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair  one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slowmotion closeup awash in a lot of bass  
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell  
jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks  then laughs maniacally    
cut to random guy with eye patch    
iguana out of focus    
iguana comes into focus  
wow  man  
when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel  it came as no surprise to me  
there are plenty of elements here that  if extended and fleshed out more  would have made for a decent story  
and i wouldnt be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere  or waiting in the wings for the dvd special directors cut    
not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing  
the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition  
some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone  and this time i didnt particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap  the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking  
someone near cellphoneguy did eventually yell   shut the hell up    but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen
