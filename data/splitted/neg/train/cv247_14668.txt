  an intimate  characterdriven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life   read the press notes for reachtherock  
im not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow  completely uninvolving bore i sawat least  it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film  
alessandro nivola plays robin fleming  a troubled  directionless yearold who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town  
police sergeant phil quinn  william sadler  takes him in  and what ensues for the first  minutes is a tedious series of sneakouts and sneakins where robin slips out of his jail cell  breaks a window  then returns  all without quinn ever noticing  
also added to the pointless proceedings is some wouldbe humorous shenanigans involving quinns dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna  karen sillas   
with a half hour  if even that long  remaining  director william ryan and writer john hughes  yes  john hughes of s youth films and homealone  finally approach something close to a point  
turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise  brooke langton   who has long gone on with her life  and hughess main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired  live in the present and for the future  message  
most moviegoers  however  will likely be asleep by that time  
wide awake  however  is the cast  who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skillthus revealing the real purpose behind this listless enterprise  to serve as a series of acting exercises  
such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors  but it leaves audiences with a booby prize  
  opens october
