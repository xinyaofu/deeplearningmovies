let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years  
i am not too fond of ted turners world championship wrestling  however  and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight  
the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs  david arquette  aptly cast as a neandrathal  and sean dawkins  scott caan  who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show  
when they finally get to see their hero  wcw world champion jimmy king  played by oliver platt  
i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king   he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair  a wasted palitaliano  in a role originally meant for reallife wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later  and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff  they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it   they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back  
when they find him  they discover in horror that jimmy kings real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv  
king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king  
after convincing king that they dont care that his persona isnt real  gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro  after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcws payperview  
gee  whiz  there are so many things wrong with this movie  i dont know where to begin  
yes  i do    
  the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff  wcw president who thought up this project  thinks of wrestling fans  
he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously  
he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously  
i got news for you  eric  nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that  this is   you know  not   
i know hell probably cover arguments up by saying it isnt meant to be taken seriously but it is  because thats how big an ego bischoff has  
  there was a documentary made in   wrestling with shadows  that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation  vince mcmahons screwing bret  the hitman  hart out of the title  
this movies storyline is basically a comic ripoff of that plot with the poor mans wayne and garth thrown in  
eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair  but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon  and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart  
  
the movies main wrestler  jimmy king  has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him  
no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age  we want bad asses today  
  why make this a comedy  instead of an emotional  rockystyle drama  
i know wrestling isnt a sport  but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end  
  
in the movie  gordie starts up an illfated romance with nitro girl sasha  the lovely rose mcgowan  
what she sees in that freak marilyn manson ill never understand   only to find that she has hospitalized kings trainer for sinclair  
wouldnt it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spygirlforthebadguy cliche  
i hate that  
  
last  but certainly not least  there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen  nor did i laugh once either  
the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie  for these reasons  
  theyre the better promotion  
  they have better and younger talent  performers and wrestlers  
  
they give their fans what they want and dont treat them like idiots  
  theyre winning the ratings and theyre the promotion everybody cares about  
  simply put  they could make a movie a hundred times better  and they could do a wrestling movie the right way  
the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end  
and if i spoiled it for you  good  i saved you from wasting seven dollars
