movies dont come much more ridiculously titled than  i still know what you did last summer   but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous  the title sort of works as a warning  
more than a sillysounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor  this horror sequels moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot  what  you  did last summer  you  actually did the summer before last summer  and since  i  knew about it this summer as well as last summer  its really illogical to say that  i  still know what  you  did last summer  
the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter  i still know   the longer  i still know what you did two summers ago  or the appropriate  stupid people getting hacked to bits   
that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart  
for example  if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago  would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet  even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress  
probably not  but thats precisely what college student karla  pop diva brandy  does to best friend julie  jennifer love hewitt   resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights  
julie  youll recall  was one of the sole survivors at the end of s surprise hit  i know what you did last summer   after a slasher with a grudge to bear  its a long story  began trying to pick off her  her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village  
in this installment  the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas  and julie  yet racked by guilt  decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind  
yeah  right  
their island paradise has room  of course  for one more in the form of the stillalive killer  muse watson  from the first film  
he sports the same gortons fisherman getup  a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity  but why hes still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves    
though i suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit  
in a sense  thats the movies glaring flaw  everybody knows who the bad guy is  thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel  
the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary  but trey callaways derivative  i still know  screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims  
when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed  giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all  what does he do  
he twistties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays  youd think hed want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later  
even prequel  summer  lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh  
the innovative gallows humor that scribe  and  scream  wunderkind  kevin williamson injected into  i know  s unfolding story is sorely missed  replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like  yo   youll cheer  not shriek  when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest  
if  i know what you did last summer   however effective  was just the kind of movie that those subversive  scream  flicks poked fun at  then the deadly  i still know what you did last summer  deserves a fullblown roasting on  mystery science theatre
