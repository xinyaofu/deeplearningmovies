meanwhile  a group of white  chainsmoking  guntoting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie  
comments  watchers reborn  a cheaply made directtovideo turkey  is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers  
technically  this should have been called watchers v  but it seems that this cycle of horror movies  much like many other sequelcrazy film series  has decided to drop the numbers from the titles  
  even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi   
the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago  
this really isnt a good movie  
have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation  
well  any hope a viewer may have had  perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill  will be dashed by the time hes seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn  
theyre awful  
these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer  some weird crap about a dead indian  teens  and wolves  and an  action  movie called detonator starring scott baio  
scott baio  
what idiot dreamed this movie up  
after surviving these abysmal trailers  the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented  watchers reborn  
  maybe it wont be  that  bad  he may say to himself  
  perhaps  just perhaps  the bottomofthebarrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading  
watchers reborn  after all  is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago  
it stars mark hamill  luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  
lou rawls is even in the mix   
unfortunately  the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill  he looks very sick here   and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers  the book  
the latter is really too bad  
koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good  but he is still my favorite hack writer  
koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful  
people who read many of his books  however  often complain of repetitive plot devices  
its definately not a koontz book if there isnt    a psychic     a superintelligent dog  or    a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs  
watchers has all three devices  which may explain why its arguably the most popular of koontzs books  
the idea behind koontzs novel  though highly implausible  is very interesting  
basically  a biological war machine is created  a smart dog can be released in battle  track down its target  and then relay the targets position  psychically  to a large creature designed to kill in handtohand combat  
silly but kind of neat too  
im sorry  
i dont mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn  the movie  
i suppose i just dont want to talk about the movie itself  
this turkey is really cheesy  
no one in this movie can act  including mark hamill  and its difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero  
the cheese factor is only increased when hes involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist  geneticist  zoologist  whateverthef   kshessupposedtobe whom he befriends  
mercifully  the filmmakers opted not to do nudity  
to be honest  the only halfconvincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein  
you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts  
i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie  
and the creature  
yes  the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling  
this creature is shot about    times  but its okay  
the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing  
oh  he can also rip body parts off  allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around  
cheesy gore  
thats another main element of watchers reborn  
it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the films campiness rather than its suspense  
ultimately  i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror  scifi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the films silliness  though this film will tax even their patience  its an  minute film  but it feels like four hours   
also  i hate to admit  i have survived far worse than this  
anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin  fear the rush will know what i mean  
finally  i couldnt help but think that watchers reborn would work well as  bot fodder  for the creative folks behind one of my alltime favorite shows   mystery science theater    
this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face  
rated r  watchers reborn contains dozens of bloodspattered bodies and unconvincing gore  
it also has violence  obviously  
i wouldnt recommend it for the little kids  but im sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay  
instead of watching this film  however  i recommend reading koontzs book  
trust me  itll be time much  much better spent
