you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the  odd couple ii  sneak preview  
they were as happy a group of men as ive ever encountered  
  what a great movie   exclaimed one gent at the urinal   everything was so true   
  yeah   laughed a man standing next to him   i drive as slow as that one guy did  
my kids give me holy hell for it   
  and peeing is a big part of my day  just like with felix   chuckled another fellow  as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife  
if youre over  and in the habit of driving at least  miles per hour below the posted speed limit   neil simons the odd couple ii  may be just the film for you  
others will likely be less charitable  
while  the odd couple ii  is amiable enough  neil simons shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slappedtogether tv reunion show  suffering from wheezing situation comedy setups and jokes straight out of the borschtbelt  
simon  once the toast of broadway  has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson  missouri  
the contrived story  involving the marriage of their kids  provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger  who havent seen each other in  years  
the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and  quite literally  run into one another at the airport  
they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina  get lost and have a series of  wacky  adventures on the road  
jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob  
while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair  the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that theyve headlined three films together since    grumpy old men    grumpier old men  and  out to sea   
still  the two veteran actors are fun to watch  
matthau  whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes  has a field day as oscar  the crown prince of the curmudgeons  
lemmon  looking pastier than usual  is fine as the ever annoying felix  who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of  phnah  
phnah   
despite their bickering  the characters have real affection for each other  providing a welcome respite from the nonstop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together  
unfortunately  matthau and lemmons charm isnt enough to compensate for simons hack script  which wouldnt pass muster even on a upn sitcom  
one contrived situation follows another  lathered with enough stale one liners to supply a dozen wouldbe comics on openmike night at the local comedy club  
if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was  try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements  
burger king gets one  as does the el pollo loco taco joint  but budget renta car really hits the jackpot  
between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name  i couldnt keep count of all the plugs  
i did  however  keep track of some of the swearing  
i came up with four  goddamns   three  shitheads  and two  fucks   
the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience  but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them  howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word  
its sad that a writer of neil simons stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs  but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise  
one running gag involves oscar and felixs inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held  
at one point  the men actually spend  seconds just freeassociating  riffing off variants of the word  san   
the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing  
one of the oldest maxims of filmgoing is  beware of movies that use the authors name in the title   
  neil simons the odd couple ii  is no exception to the rule  
while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon  it has no business playing in a movie theater  
of course  theres a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word ive written  and would probably whip my  youngwhippersnapper  ass to boot  
one things for sure  though  
theyll never catch me in a car chase
