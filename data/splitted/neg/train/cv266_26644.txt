the spy game is up  
you can thank charlies angels  the movie  for that  
when did banality and pandering become okay  
just steal from hong kong  the matrix  and a kitschy tv show from the mids and thats a movie  
charlies angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film ive seen in ages  
charlies angels is dumb  
just plain dumb  
as we all know  three of the hottest females on the planet  drew barrymore  cameron diaz  and lucy liu  are three superagents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie  
they all drive fast cars  look ohsofabulous even in the morning  and dont seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men  having buildings explode ten feet in front of them  or flying through the air in matrix slowmotion  
and while the entourage spends  minutes romping around in cleavagebusting wetsuits  cleavagebusting waitress uniforms  and cleavagebusting wet tshirts  they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying  drunk sorority girls  the kind who hit on everybody at a party  
the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer  the great sam rockwell  who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company  
of course  the rival wants control of his new personal identification system  which involves such latterday buzzwords as gps  cellular tracking  and even mainframe  
the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels  like battling each of them in many roundrobin matrix ripoff  again  fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to slicedoff locks of the angels hair  
the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley  serving as charlies manservant  or  more to the point  the angels pimp  
the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc  enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables  carboncopy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft  and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourkes longlost brother  
charlies angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight  
nothing is difficult  plausible  or believable in any of the angels actions  
it feels like the matrix  mission  impossible   and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one  
diaz is a knucklehead  
barrymore is the  dangerous one   mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role  
liu is just    
lucy liu  looking good in a skintight black leather suit  
the list of movies from which charlies angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing  
the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon  lethal weapon ii  all of jackie chans movies  the great escape  saturday night fever  revenge of the nerds  payback  darkman  dr  no  the matrix  as mentioned   and even tvs friends  
its a shame  too  because one of the many screenwriters  john august  was at the helm of last years favorite  go  
then again  what can you expect from a director known solely as  mcg   
there is no camp value in the film  no interesting main characters  no invigorating action scenes  no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players  
note to hollywood  next time  lets leave the tv shows on the tv
