as you should know  this summer has been less than memorable  
with a total of  decent films  its not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing  
with that said  you can pretty much predict what my opinion on  the th warrior  will be  
the film is based on the michael crichton  eaters of the dead   in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king  
after tarveling for many months  he comes across a gang of norsemen  who are forced to pick  men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog  
so  they start picking men  and are left without   thus ahmed is choosen  
so far it sounds interesting right  
not when all of this takes place in  minutes  
after that  they basically run around killing  
that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film  because once your story is introduced  you have the rest of the film to start developing it  
obviously thats not the case here  
even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure  you will be disappointed  
since all the action takes place in fog  it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances  and to poor camera work  
cant the camera men sit still  
id like to actually watch a film in focus  but again  they failed to deliver that as well  
the film moves on and on until the point  where you can care less about anything but the popcorn youre eating  
with corny dialogue  that the characters laugh at for some odd reason  a script that goes nowhere  dull action sequences  a predictable ending  and worst of all weak characters  theres basically nothing to like here  except for maybe the set designs  
thats the only thing that honestly caught my interest  
when i heard that john mctiernan  the director  wanted his name kept out of the project  that made me wonder why  
well now i know  
crichtons greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product  which led to a big arguement  
whats there to argue about anyway  
the film couldnt be saved  no matter how much they spent or casted  
seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money  i wouldnt be surprised to see  the th warrior  become a hit  
please do me a favor and save your money at all costs  or else you will be lost in the fog  like the film itself
