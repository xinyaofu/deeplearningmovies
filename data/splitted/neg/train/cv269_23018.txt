if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films  i might say that i review movies that dont look particularly good because im doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it  
if that were true  i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads   shay casey  seeing bad movies so you dont have to   
but i know thats bunkyoure going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say  
so i have to tell the truth  every once in a while i get a nasty  masochistic urge to see a bad movie  
you know the feeling  when youre sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly  
sometimes i think thats why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies  ever  
admit it  sometimes you like seeing bad movies  
so do i  
so i saw  supernova   
truth be told   supernova  wasnt quite as bad as i thought it might be  
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors  or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadnt started tinkering with the directors  walter hill  final cut  causing him to want his name removed  
maybe im becoming a softy  
in any case  i didnt find  supernova  as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe  
but its still bad  
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel  nightingale   
the crew includes captain a  j  
marley  robert forster   his new second officer nick vanzant  james spader   head medical officer kaela evers  angela bassett   medical technicians yerzy penalosa  lou diamond phillips  and danika lund  robin tunney   and computer technician benj sotomejor  wilson cruz   
there are some attempts at  characterization   but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction  which puts kaela on edge  yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes  and benj  apparently gay  is in love with the computer  apparently female   
dont expect any more explanation  because you wont get it  
anyway  the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent  
during the dimension jump  i think thats what its called  but dont hold me to it   the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal  peter facinelli  is brought on board  
he calls himself troy larson  making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with  
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  
have you seen  alien   
have you seen  event horizon   a lame movie in its own right   
good  
then youve seen  supernova   
postproduction cuts or not  there is nothing original about this screenplay  and nothing unpredictable either  
after all  no ones going to think for a second that troy wont turn out to be a villain  
but the bigger problem with  supernova  is that it can t just stick to the simple plot its afforded  
numerous rewrites  the script may be credited to three people  but its a gross underestimate  have crammed this lean minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped  
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot  
did the ships computer learn something about humanity  
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him  
and just what does the films title signify  if anything  
as far as i can tell  it refers to a very small plot detail that isnt developed  just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements  
character relationships in this film also make very little sense  
for some reason  every person in this film keeps having sex  
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first  minutes  
bassett and spaders characters start off hating each other  
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later  theyre engaging in some hankypanky  
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship  of course both female crew members will fall in love with him  
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly  which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut  
the most prominent example  however  may be the fact that when the film starts  there are no opening credits  
furthermore  the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits  
maybe thats why the films title is mentioned twice during the end credits  right between james spader and robert forster  
right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie youre seeing  lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery   you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene  with littletono introduction to any of the characters or situations  
the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes  you know  where they explain things  and just went from point a to point b  point a  danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby  
point b  tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing  
doesnt make sense  
since i didnt understand anything about these characters motivations  did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone  and he does  knocking off three of them in about  minutes   
not a whit  
its a shame  because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do  
they dont find it  
bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces  
sexual tension  
more like constipation  
maybe theyre just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as  this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice   
not that we ever find out who that is  mind you  
the climax of their relationship  taking place in a transport pod  is probably the films biggest foreheadslapper  
as troy  peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected  
he s awfully onenote  but its not as if hes given any more notes to work with  
the rest of the cast does even less  
tunney stands around looking cute  then scared  
phillips broods  
cruz flirts with the computer  
then they all die and a star blows up or something  but i really wasnt paying much attention by then  
  supernova  is pretty awful  but im cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got  
thats it  
if you expect it to be good  for whatever reasons you may have   youll probably hate it more than i will  
even the special effects are fairly unimpressive  nothing you haven t seen before  and suffice to say the script isnt going to save the film  
honestly  though  what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym  
it usually results in a bad movie  and thats what  supernova  is
