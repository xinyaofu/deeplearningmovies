the main problem with martin lawrences pet project  a thin line between love and hate  like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man  is that his character is an irresponsible jerk  and if that is the case  it doesnt seem to do anything except justify the womans actions  
that is especially the case in lawrences darnell wright  
he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long  
now dont think i condone this just because im male  
my philosophy is  if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful  kind girl  you should treat her like a princess and respect her  
darnell doesnt think like this  
he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them  
and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target  beautiful  wealthy brandi web  played nicely by whitfield  who runs a successful real estate business  is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia  king   i found myself thinking   im supposed to feel sorry for this guy   
after all  it is largely darnells fault  
if he is lining up all these women  youd think hed have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day  as his mother says it does  
but he doesnt  so you get the sense that hes not only irresponsible  but also pretty dumb  
you especially get this sense that hes dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her  
  id put my pants on in two seconds after that   
now  brandi is a psycho bitch  but its hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage  
one final flaw  though  is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with  
brandi is a classy  intelligent woman with an mba from harvard  who initally resists darnells  immature play  as she calls it  as any woman like her would in real life  
but all of a sudden she says yes  
but when you listen to darnells four letter word vocabulary watch his actions  you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period  much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him  
lawrence can be good when he wants to  but in order to prove it  he needs to let other people write and direct his movies  
look at this movie  
four writers  as a result its too long  two hours  when it couldve easily worked at ninety minutes   and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came  which makes me think the writers didnt get along   all of which isnt necessary  
there are some bright spots  though  
whitfield  regina king  della reese  and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts  and they help it out a lot  
and there are some funny parts  like  for example  the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property   but theyre just not enough to sustain the film
