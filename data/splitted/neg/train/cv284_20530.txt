if only austin powers  the spy who shagged me had been just half as original  zany  silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor  it would have easily been one of this summers biggest pleasures  
if only  
in fact  the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original  instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another  the filmmakers bombard us with usedup  tired jokes taken directly from the first one  
take the scene where austin powers  again played by mike myers  but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously  confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff  
after being pushed off the ravine  the bad guy is of course assumed dead  
but suddenly  we hear a pleading voice coming from down below  hes only injured  
a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery  but here i was insulted by it  
did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a ripoff  
apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average moviegoer  considering that the film has pulled in over  million in domestic theatrical grosses alone  
do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way  
having said that  though  i still cannot deny the film its merits  
the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat  dr  evil  mike myers  in the second of his three roles   having constructed a time machine  goes back to the year  in an attempt to snatch austin powers  mojo   dont you just love that word   
whilst he is cryogenically frozen  
when austin gets wind of this  after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurleys vanessa kensington   he too travels back in time to reclaim his sexual drive  accompanied by the hottotrot felicity shagwell  played by heather graham  
this sounds stupid  i know  but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird  offthewall sense  and it worked for me  
then theres minime  verne troyer   a    
petite clone of myers dr  evil  exactly  in size  
troyers persona alone gains the film an extra halfstar  contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own minimr  
bigglesworth  
just try to ignore the fact that  at   he would make dr  evils height rise to just over  feet  
no matter  
however  there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half  the most notable being the now infamous tent scene   and that just isnt enough to warrant even a minor recommendation  
if there is in fact an  austin powers    they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr  evil and minime  
unconventional  yes  but theres no denying that itd make for a better movie
