tvs buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in  simply irresistible   
sarah michelle gellar  that neverceasing crusader against neverending evil every tuesday night on the wb network  here plays a downonherluck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals  
taste test results  some vampire slaying  though out of place  would have really livened this excruciating movie up  
  simply irresistible  is actually quite easy to deny  a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on  
gellars amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom  sean patrick flannery of powder  around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking  a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the publics in her tiny tribeca eatery  
all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story  a tale that at times plays like an american spin on s mexican classic  like water for chocolate   
several differences  one   like water  didnt have a telekinetic crab  and two   like water  was a good film  
  simply irresistible   on the other hand  is about as challenging as an easybake oven  
amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness  from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger  though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish  
the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals  but its not like youre were going to miss much  
in fact  take away the few instances of salty language and this has madefordisney channel written all over it  
but a majority of  simply irresistible  s resistibility factor has less to do with the aforementioned overkill than the bland leads  tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that theres just no fun rooting for their inevitable  happily ever after   
nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense  so were left with a hohum relationship based on enchanted eclairs  its not going to last long  people  
perhaps sensing this  the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley  dylan baker and patricia clarkson  but they dont go anywhere either  
in fact  nothing in  simply irresistible  goes anywhere save for gellar  and she doesnt go somewhere so much as you wish shed go somewhere  like to a better movie  
already proving major talent with relatively few big and smallscreen roles  shes the sole reason this overcooked souffle isnt completely fit for the garbage disposal  looking smashing in her todd oldhamdesigned duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return  
its certainly a dish best not served in its current condition  but one can only guess that  without gellar   simply irresistible  would be strictly unwatchable
