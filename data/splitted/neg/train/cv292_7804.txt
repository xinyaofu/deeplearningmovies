capsule  an insult  
a stupid and incompetent movie that doesnt even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable  
weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes  
money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  
its not simply idiotic  its contemptuous of its audience  
it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely  
its a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson  who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here  
its not even fun as trash  
woody and wesley star  maybe thats not the right word  as new york city transit authority police  
they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie  one of them plays drunk possum to attract chainsnatchers and the other does lookout  
i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this  raised by a documentary id seen on the subject once  but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thoughtprovoking  
see if you can follow this  
they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the  money train   the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books  is parked  
the guards on the train see this kid running at them  lift their machine guns  shout  halt   
and then open fire when the kid doesnt stop running at them  
blam  the kids dead  
then woody and wesley show up  and of course the other ta cops hate them  why    and a pushing match starts  and someone gets decked  and    i covered my face  
id seen enough  
ive never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy  systematically  any chance of being credible or interesting  
fed up with the bs at their job  most of it their own goddamned fault   woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train  
hence the title  in case some of you  all two of you  didnt figure it out yet  
then theres this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks   and  a love story   and  a holdup  no  two holdups  sorry  easy to lose track in a movie this braindead   and  a mob boss who wants his money  
there wasnt a minute when i gave a horses ass about any of it  
neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute  
we do not care about them  
they are not interesting  
they are noisy  loud  stupid  foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy  
they deserve to get shot  or run over  as the case may be  
they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was  written  into a movie like white men cant jump  and which simply does not exist here  
they are idiots  and were expected to root for them  
bullcrap  
the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture  
what exactly is this mess  
a cop movie  
police procedure is not given a moments genuine thought anywhere  
a thriller  
the subplot with the token booth killer is inept  a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite  
a comedy  
the few jokes that do work are wasted  
a drama  
all dramatic tension between both principals is freezedried and offtherack  
theres not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk  its all screenwriterese  that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of fourletter words  
  actual dialogue excerpt   fuck you   
  what   
  you heard me  fuck  you    
  no  fuck  you     
look  ill be honest here  
ive tried writing screenplays  and even  i  suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess  id get laughed out of the office  
anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch  because god knows i know i can do better  
ive weasted enough time on this piece of tripe
