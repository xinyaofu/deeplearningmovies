mm  written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker  has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery  
nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles  who is asked by upper class toff mrs  christian  myra carter  to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe  
the movie happens to be an mythical snuff movie  where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed  
all mrs  christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not  
welles agrees  and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies  with video clerk max california  phoenix  as his guide  
although the snuff industry hasnt really been examined in mainstream cinema  mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most  
the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing  although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away  
mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much  and apart from a few moments  most of the action in the film is nothing you havent seen from another standard thriller  
the cast help towards the entertainment  apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage  
while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona     ever since leaving las vegas     cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot  such as in the terrible snake eyes     
here  in mm  hes boring  uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice  
and in this overlong thriller  these virtues do not help keep the suspense up  
only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving  as phoenix is a true talent  
his performance is a great break away from the gloom  and hes just purely enjoyable to watch  
catherine keener is completely wasted as cages wife  although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves  
her character  though  is hugely underwritten  one of the most wasted characters of the year  
also fun is fargos peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director  
as this film is written by the person behind seven  mm is filled with doom and gloom  and noone appears to know how to use an light switch  
unlike seven  mm isnt too clever  and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives  
lacking the strong characters seven featured  mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise  and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment  
but director joel schumacher  the completely wrong guy for the job  puts style over content  and while the direction and look are good  its just not very disturbing  
schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience  and though we are meant to be looking at the dark belly of the porn industry  it doesnt exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind  which misses the point  
also  the last  minutes are so hackneyed  so cliched  its amazing to think its the same film youre watching  
mm is far from an success  a snuffed opportunity  
with a boring lead character  controversial scenes that manage not to be controversial  and a director obsessed with looks  what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller  
ultimately  mm is probably worth renting on home video  unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like  
and trust me  the rest of the  hours are not worth it
