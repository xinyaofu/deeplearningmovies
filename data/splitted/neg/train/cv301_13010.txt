carry on at your convenience is all about the goingson in the factory of a toilet manufacturer  wc boggs  kenneth williams   
once they have won an order to manufacture  bidets in two months and charles coote  charles hawtrey  has designed a suitable model  the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner  kenneth cope  and friend bernie hulke  bernard bresslaw  who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext  
meanwhile  chief foreman sid plummer  sid james  is growing tired of his wife beattie  hattie jacques  and her budgie  
he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore  joan sims  but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races  he is over the moon and flush with money  
his daughter  myrtle plummer  jacki piper   is going out with wcs son lewis boggs  richard ocallaghan  and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions  
in the end  if the strike does not cease  boggs will have to close down his factory  but the support of a group of women led by cootes wifetobe and spanners mother  agatha spanner  renee houston   try to resolve the situation  
also  sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners  
there are some good performances  as usual  from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles  
charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes  
his part is mildly amusing  
richard ocallaghan is appealing as boggs stuckup son  patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering  boggs assistant  and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha  
however  sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer  
although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline  she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character  
a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress  
the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope  
in his carry on debut  cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny  
joan sims returns as the love interest  instead of barbara windsor   
sims usual part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques  
additionally  bill maynard as fred moore is very poor  
this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer   the locations and wealth of characters are appealing  
however  the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired  
this movie does not know where it is going  
it was made in  and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for bluer jokes or to maintain the innocent jokes success of most of its predecessors  
that is why this film suffers  
a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques  
the new minorregulars such as ocallaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while
