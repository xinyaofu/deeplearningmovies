walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century foxs anastasia  
but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios  the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about  
disneys recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas  the hunchback of notre dame  and to a lesser extent  hercules  
with anastasia  fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window  
some may say  so what  
its just a kids movie  
well    
if you have young kids  beware  as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpserotting rasputin zombie  whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way  
consider yourselves warned  
nevertheless  the animation is quite stunning at times  
don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout  occasionally rivalling photographic quality  
and yet in other scenes  the handdrawn material seems of the saturdaymorning tv crowd  which leads me to wonder    
was this rushed to market to combat disney  
the plot  as anyone who had read history before knows  concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in   
not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened  
as for the plot  go rent disneys candleshoe  
youll see  of anastasia there
