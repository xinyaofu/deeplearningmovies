because no one demanded it  david duchovny in a romantic comedy  
at last  both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources  
the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot  which could be fodder for a valentines day episode of  the xfiles   
bob rueland  david duchovny  loses his wife elizabeth  joely richardson  in a car accident  
at the same time  grace briggs  minnie driver  is in the hospital  waiting for a heart transplant  
grace gets elizabeths heart  and it leads her to bob  
its the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people  
four writers are credited with contributing to the story  
that doesnt seem possible  
despite being a solid two hours long   return to me  adds little to the  boy meets girl  boy loses girl  formula and  as a result  is terribly tedious and slowmoving  
duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks  and i kept wishing for a fastforward button to move their scenes along  
since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before  i blame duchovny  
hes out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series  and ive always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on  the xfiles  comes off more siblinglike than hotandbothered   
theres something about duchovny that makes me uneasy  
regardless of the role hes playing  he comes off as a weirdo  
the only redeeming quality of  return to me  is its hilarious supporting cast  
the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker  and they generate the only laughs in the movie  
carroll oconnor is graces grandfather marty oreilly  
when bob comes into martys restaurant after hours  marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status  
when marty discovers that bob is a widower  he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration   this is bob  
his wife is dead   
the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news  
also funny  bonnie hunt as graces best friend megan and james belushi as megans husband joe  
married with children  megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance  
although its rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater  belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill  
rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bobs best friend and robert loggia as martys brotherinlaw angelo  
in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast  
bottom line  if you are compelled to see this movie  watch it on video so you can fastforward to scenes with carroll oconnor and james belushi
