drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside  the one whos the awkward klutz or the spunky doityourselfer  the one who just doesnt fit in with the others  
she has perfected these characters in movies such as  the wedding singer  and  most notably   ever after   
now shes back  starring in what could be called a modernday cinderella fable   never been kissed   
you know its a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary  
trust me on this one  no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg  and i dont mean steve  invented the printing press  
the premise is simple  
barrymores josie geller  at  the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago suntimes  is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what todays teens are feeling and doing  
josie  she says she was named after the s cartoon character  was a geek in high school  so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance  
this time  she thinks  she will get it right and be accepted by the incrowd  
now  what kind of adult  with a good job and a successful career  would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was  and is  high school and adolescence  
these are among the many problems that plague  never been kissed   
screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie  
their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy  blubbering womanchild at the least provocation  
and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high schools most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability  
ok  so  never been kissed  is not a sociological expose of todays high school scene  
however  certain rules should apply to film  and one of those is consistency of character  
among the movies problems is the illconceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and  in the process  lose focus on her assignment  
any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say  get me rewrite   
to be fair  barrymore is very appealing  but she is given very little to work with  
she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character  but the script continually undermines her  
barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk  talk and act like a cool  hip high schooler  
otherwise  she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teenage stereotypes and situations  
  never been kissed  is entertaining and funny in fits and starts  
it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish  
the movies main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys  the outsider who befriends new student josie  
josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys  yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls  
real mature  
and that is the main deficiency with  never been kissed   
its illogical  unrealistic  uneven and undemanding  
it has some warm and humorous spots  but not enough to overcome its many obstacles
