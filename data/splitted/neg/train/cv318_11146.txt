comments   alan smithee  directed fatal charm  which should have been more appropriately titled  fatal bore  or  fatal crap   
if you find out that a film youre about to see is directed by  alan smithee   then you should seriously  seriously  seriously consider watching something  anything  else  
  alan smithee  is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad  
frankly  id be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey  so i think i understand why the director might have picked the  alan smithee  moniker for this film  
where to begin with this painfully poor thriller  
lets start with the acting  
its pretty bad  
amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent  the rest of the cast dont   even though her performance isnt exactly stellar material  
shes also miscast  she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete  
her scenes with valeries mother  played by mary frann  are a joke  
the two look as though theyre a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together  rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesnt understand  
christopher atkins  a handsome enough actor who plays the killer  adam  looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm  
trying to appear malicious and dangerous  he wears large sunglasses and a halfbuttoned jacket  
if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber  atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead  but he doesnt cut it here  
early on in the movie  a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom  
outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers  the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film  
they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever  
fatal charms storyline  such as it is  inspires more yawns than thrills  
the script belabors a red herring  early on  about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam  atkins  is charged with  
this suspect  however  turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film  an obvious plot fault  
even for the idiots who didnt consider the movies title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed  it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up  
so  the audience must wait  if they havent already stopped watching  as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawnout finale  
the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an  erotic thriller   
a thriller it isnt  and neither is it particularly erotic  
i cant imagine  if someone were in the mood for something  erotic   that hed be happy after watching this fluff  
a few erotic moments occur in the film  they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus  see  theyre supposed to be valeries fantasies  how creative   
on a personal note  i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through  
its no wonder why she hated high school so much  
as an instructor of english myself  i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature  a teacher would stoop to reading a students bad poetry  of course  its valeries  about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poems inspiration  
i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students  
fatal charm wont charm anyone  unless theres someone thats charmed by boring  lifeless  insipid  suspenseless thrillers  
if you happen upon this turkey  just keep moving on
