this movie is based off the wildly popular videogame series of the same name  
before this film  the game had a few spinoff cartoons which were ok  
but the idea of doing a movie is insane  
it should have been animated  if it should have been done at all  
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast  
yet it still fails  
the plot is completely different from the games plot im not complaining about that  
the story involves the mario bros  having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company  
eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis  which happens to be enviromentally unsafe  
so  due to luigis  john leguizamo  girlfriend  princess daisy  they go and investigate  
they get transported to a blade runneresque world lead by king koopa  dennis hopper   
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic megacity jumbles in  
the plot is fine better than the movie deserves  
the acting is ok  
this seems to be more of a visual film  
the special effects are good  especially on the robotic yoshi  
however the film drags and is no fun  
and it leaves itself open to a sequel  which probably wont ever be made  
this movie begins sort of promising  but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth  
so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper  then watch super mario bros   
the movie  
you could do worse  
but you could definitely do better    
  
street fighter  the movie    starring  raul julia and jean claude vandamme 
this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter   it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot  
it is more like a  movie  than it should be  
yes  its watchable  
raul julia does a good job  considering this was his final film  
while the game had nonstop fighting sequences  this movie is a hodgepodge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time  
does it work  
sort of    
the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m  bison  raul julia   
guile  jean claude vandamme  takes his troops to attack bisons main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over  
in a short amount of time  the movie introduces several characters well  
it catches your attention  
but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like  theres chun li    
or  look at that fireball ryu did at vega   
it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets  but goes no further  
this movie needed more action in the first place  
the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting  
if you like lighthearted action flicks  or if you liked the game  watch this one  
it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julias last performance  or if you cant get enough of van damme  
other than that  you could find better action flicks
