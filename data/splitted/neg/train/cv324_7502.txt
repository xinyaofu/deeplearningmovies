i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world  
and i wish that filmmakers would use commandments as a blueprint on how not to do it  
writerdirector daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soulsearching in this tale of seth warner  aidan quinn   a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires countrywestern lyrics  his pregnant wife drowns  his home is destroyed by a tornado  he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning  
convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant  seth decides to break his  and sets out to turn every  thou shalt not  of the ten commandments into a  thou shalt   and vice versa   
his wifes sister rachel   friends   courteney cox  wants to help seth  rachels selfish husband harry  anthony lapaglia   who tends to break a few commandments of his own  thinks seth is a lunatic  
thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion  
taplitz isnt interested in treating seths tragedies as genuinely tragic  making it impossible to sympathize with him  
composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds  turning seths sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark  quinns performance as seth is all wildeyed fervor without any genuine pain  
the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought  with one through five dispatched in a fiveminute montage  
the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a highconcept movie plot  
its not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth  
corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has  while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seths  false witness   
only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance  she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve  
even she cant force taplitz to decide whose story this is  or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite  
by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film  it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience  
commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith  and the loss thereof  at all seriously
