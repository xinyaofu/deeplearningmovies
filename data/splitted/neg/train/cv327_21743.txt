the bachelor is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see  
wading through this gooey  detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic  
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris odonnell vehicle should wander elsewhere  the bachelor is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy  
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money  
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical prettyboy cocoon  chris odonnell has an effortless charm as an actor  
most will recognize him as the highflying robin from the two latest batman films  but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile  
can odonnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders  
perhaps  if he found the proper vehicle    
but the bachelor falls far short of the requirements  
the actor just cant register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success  
a few instances of adorable humor aside  it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is the bachelor  
odonnell plays jimmie  a hopeless romantic in his late twenties whos progressing in a serious relationship with anne  renee zellweger   
jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals  and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage  
the problem is that his proposal sucks  
big time  
you can tell things arent going pleasantly  because jimmie gets the infamous  deerintheheadlights look when anne questions his approach  
and then  the plot  along with the stupidity of the movie  thickens  
jimmies grandfather  peter ustinov  dies suddenly  leaving a video will behind for his grandson  who also happens to be his only living relative   
everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of  million dollars to jimmie  
of course  theres a catch  he must get married before his th birthday  stay joined with his bride for an entire decade  and produce healthy children within the first five years  
the bad news is that jimmies birthday is the following day  
with anne out of town  he must find a willing bride to share his riches with    
and within a very limited time frame  
there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of the bachelor  
for one  the movies approach is interesting and not dripping with clich   
another is the colorful cast  
odonnell and zellweger are cute together  and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in its own mediocrity  
ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure  and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmies marital adventures  
and now the cons  the approach may be interesting  but in trying an oldfashioned method  director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel  
the characters are drawn with obvious  broad strokes  and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable  
yes  the bachelor is far more frustrating than cute  
the screenplay is lamely written  and the subject matter poorly conceived  
the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted  along with whatever promise the film initially contained  
potential goes out the window early to suit sinyors colorful approach  but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the directors wishes  
the bachelor becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it  
youve seen the tv spots  havent you  
odonnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads what is this man running from   
in actuality  hes fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune  its one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film   
after seeing the movie  i believe that the approaching horde could be something else  
odonnell could be running from his angry fans  who have just endured the bachelor  and are hunting him down for revenge
