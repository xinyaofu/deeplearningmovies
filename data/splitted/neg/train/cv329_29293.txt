beware of movies with the directors name in the title  
take  john carpenters ghosts of mars   please   
if the carpenter brand name wasnt superglued to the title  this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network  
and i would have been spared a headache  
the latest from the director of  starman    halloween  and  escape from new york  is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a futuristic horror flick  
the production is set on mars in   where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world  
six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the red planet  terraforming to make it more hospitable for future generations  
a matriarchal society  
terraforming  
sounds pretty intriguing  eh  
well  dont get your hopes up
