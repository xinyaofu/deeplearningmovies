can you say  dated   
you can if youve seen rosemarys baby which  like the exorcist  was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release  
  mystery science theater   has skewered the bad films of the past  but let me tell you  it could do a number on the  good  ones too  
rosemarys baby stars mia farrow  from the time she was actually goodlooking  as an innocent housewife and her notsoinnocent husband  john cassavettes   an actor who takes an easy  albeit evil  road to success  
it all seems so harmless in the beginning  
mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed  
  theres also a skull in the living room  but its only for decoration   
their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming  
alls well for about the first hour of this slowmoving film  until mia eats some of the neighbors chocolate mousse and passes out  
when she comes to  she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big  evil man raping her  a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen  
it seems like a dream and  when she finds herself pregnant  she almost forgets about it  
and everyones helping with the pregnancy  
the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink  a goodluck charm for her to wear around her neck  and the name of an obstetrician whos been in the business    
years  
meanwhile  mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight  
before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries  
thats when you know your healths failing  
the only person in the movie whos the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend  maurice evans  who calls mia up to give her the bad news  and immediately falls into a coma  
by about the twohour mark i felt the same way  
rosemarys baby is way too long  and leads up to a payoff thats about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie  
i guess someone put a spell on this movie
