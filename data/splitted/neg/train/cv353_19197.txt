summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lees abilities  
lee is a great filmmaker  often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg  
but here  he gets himself into a bind  
his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work  
the summer of  was an unusual summer in new york city  
it was the hottest summer on record  
to boot  new yorks first serial killer was on the loose  calling himself the son of sam  david berkowitz killed  people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population  
so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout  people went berserk  causing billions of dollars in damage to the city  
the movies focus is on a group of twentysomethings during that fateful summer  vinny  john leguizamo   a clubhopping  adultrous hairdresser  his benevolent wife dionna  mira sorvino  looking young   ritchie  adrian brody   a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect  a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters  
we follow them through their roller coaster lives  thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings  
vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him  make him stay faithful to her  
ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more  eccentric   and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend  
tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sams first murder looms  the night he promises he will strike again  
a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects  
at the top of the list is ritchie  
vinny  an unwilling part of the said group  is called upon to set a trap for his friend  
as we watch these proceedings  some of which are painfully graphic  the dreaded  so what   
question springs to mind  
from the way this movie is made  id have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something  but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find  
lee touches on so much  the media  the s punk scene  the details of the actual killings  as well as the characters very personal dilemmas  but he doesnt bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement  
all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow  it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable  
too bad summer of sam doesnt get any help here  
frankly  its a bore  a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesnt entertain beyond its first half hour  
there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague  
leguizamos turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny  
the script makes it clear that were supposed to believe that his character is flawed  but still a good guy  
youd never guess from his performance  
adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better  
sorvino gives a riveting  touching performance in a banal movie  im tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane   her character is affecting and her emotions truetoheart  
brody  too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for  
summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film  it looks great  it has a few notable performances and i suppose its pretty well directed  in a purely technical way  
but its also empty  pretentious and boring  
like last years the thin red line  its a movie by a director who doesnt know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway
