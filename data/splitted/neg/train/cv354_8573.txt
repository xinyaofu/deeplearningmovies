wow  a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever  
im amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen  
many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race  
i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves  and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sexcrazed buffoons  
even im offended by it  
bill bellamy is a  player  which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them  
what a pleasant main character  
one day  his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player  
why they decide this  one day  i have no idea  
how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn  
anyway  bellamy agrees to teach  and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women  
this is the bulk of the film folks  guys riding from house to house  one keeps getting out to have sex  while the others sit in the car  
since russell simmons is producer  and since the official title of the film is  def jams how to be a player   i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy  
amazingly  aside from gilbert gottfrieds  seconds of screen time  there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner  
instead of jokes  theres just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts  and naked breasts arent so bad  but naked breasts alone dont make a good movie   
be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well  
gilbert gottfrieds character serves as one in his very brief appearance  asking for explanations as to what is being said  
they should have brought him along for the entire film
