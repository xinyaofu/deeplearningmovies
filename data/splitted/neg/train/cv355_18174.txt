bob the happy bastards quickie review  
the odd couple ii 
grumpy old men  it aint  
hell  my fellow americans  it aint  
walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years  
odd couple ii feels terribly generic  where in the first movie  made thirty one years ago  feels like a wonderful tale  
thats like repackaging campbells soup in a generic food can  really  
how writer neil simon couldve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me  
throughout the movie  i really didnt laugh once  
honestly  
i mean  there were dumb situations  yeah  like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice  but they just really didnt seem funny to me  
and that car rolling off the cliff  
the only way i wouldve seen humor in that is if they were still in it  
and the ending gets all supermushy  too  
in the final twenty minutes or so  lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one  then loses her  matthau talks to his son  a wasted jonathan silverman  about his amrriage to lemmons daughter  and  of course  lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands  
ooh  i really gave a lot away there  im sure  
consider it a hospitable gester  you wont waste your time renting this muck
