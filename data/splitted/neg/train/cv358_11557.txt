wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day  provided  of course  that youre the victim of a frontal lobotomy  
there is  in fact  no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at  moviegoers in their late teens and early twenties  the most lucrative target group  
this is film noir for the mtv generation  fastpaced  slick  flashy  gleefully mindless  and hollow to the core  
wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of   
ive seen more convincing drama  with nearly as much bare flesh  on that pinnacle of narrative quality  baywatch  
wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking its a thriller with a real story  
what it is  however  is a series of increasingly improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists  
everything in between those serpentine moments is filler  a flash of a breast  a spatter of blood  and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie  
the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess  just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen  and that will probably be it  
using this approach  i was right three times and wrong only once  
thats not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about whats around the next corner  
the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie  the hot  young cast and the old standby  sex  
both have an abundance of screen time  although ill admit that the films erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected  
nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu   
the softcore sex sequences are generic  and dont generate much heat  
the lesbian kisses cant hold a candle to those in bound  
theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances  neve campbell  possessing an ironclad  no nudity  clause in her contract  keeps her clothes more or less on   
the films greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower  
maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fullyclothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick  mrs  
kevin bacon  is familiar with  
the director of wild things is john mcnaughton  whose last effort was the finelytuned psychological thriller  normal life  
that movie featured copious sex  a pair of real characters  and a powerful script  
its difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker  
but i suppose we all need to put food on the table  
mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here  in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success  his previous widerelease picture  mad dog and glory  was a boxoffice disappointment   
quick cuts and pretty sunrises cant even begin to cover up this movies flaws  
the main character  and i use that term lightly  since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality  is sam lombardo  matt dillon   a guidance counselor at floridas blue bay high school  
a student  the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan  denise richards   has a crush on him  
one afternoon  she comes to his house to wash his car  and  when she leaves  her clothing is torn  
after confessing to her mother  theresa russell  that she was raped  she goes to the police station  where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette  kevin bacon  and gloria perez  daphne rubinvega   
they are skeptical about here claims until another girl  suzie toller  neve campbell   comes forward with a similar tale  
meanwhile  sam  convinced that hes being set up  goes to a shyster lawyer  bill murray  for help  
the acting in wild things isnt very good  but none of the principals have much to work with  
this is definitely not a character based motion picture  
not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a tripledigit i  q   but it doesnt bother to give any of the onscreen individuals even a hint of depth  
the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice  but nothing more  
matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps  
neve campbell gets to model the slutty look  
denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a seethrough  onepiece bathing suit  
and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon  
the only one whos even remotely interesting is bill murray  and he seems to think hes in comedy  not a thriller  maybe hes got the right idea   
columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the films ending  which prompts the question  which ending do they want kept secret  
wild things has no less than three  one occurs during the end credits  so stay seated   all of which are jawdroppingly absurd  a feat that joe eszterhas  the writer of basic instinct and showgirls  would be impressed by  
thanks to jeffrey kimballs polished  kinetic cinematography  wild things always looks great  and george s  clintons score keeps it pulsing and throbbing  
but  no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is  this is still trash  and  like all garbage  it stinks
