capsule  gal is a sish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain  
his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he cant refuse  
a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns  
     to   
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast   who would have guessed that the most savage maddog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
ben kingsley   
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark  henry fonda in once upon a time in the west  or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild  sympathetic  or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  
gary  gal  dove  played by ray winstone  has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a onetwopunch  
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  
the second punch comes from gals past  
back in london gang boss teddy bass  ian mcshane  tvs lovejoy  is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan  ben kingsley  to fetch gal  
don will accept any decision gal makes from  yes  to  certainly   
however  if gal says  no  don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guys exporn star wife deedee  amanda redman   
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybodys skin  
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  
there are some serious problems in louis melliss and david scintos script that should have been caught before filming  
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  
beyond an ability to use skindiving gear  no special talents are required of him  
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault  flooding the vault  
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether  but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  
in spite of the provocative title  the story is cliched and overly familiar  
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw  a robert taylor type  who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability  
the old gang  however  wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git  im  
it is not a great plot  
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards  
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film  
it is an old plot dressed up to look new  
if the plot is old  at least the style is creative  
this is director jonathan glazers first film  but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout  
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences  
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes  
we see one side of a persons faces  
but the other side fades into the darkness  a sort of metaphor for the halfworld these characters inhabit  
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden  
we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog  
at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking  the heavy accents  and the cockney language  
sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre  the london crime film  
the plot may be new to british crime films  but it would be overly familiar as a western  
further respectability comes from ben kingsleys highpowered performance  
i give it a  on the  to  scale and a  on the  to  scale
