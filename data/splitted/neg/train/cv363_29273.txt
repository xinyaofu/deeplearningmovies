susan grangers review of  american outlaws   warner bros   
thomas edisons  the great train robbery     was the first western ever made and  jesse james under the black flag     first introduced the outlaw folk hero  
now  more than  similarlythemed pictures later  jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend  
the story begins as jesse  charasmatic colin farrell  and his brother frank  gabriel macht   cole and scott younger  scott caan  will mccormack  and trusty comanche tom  nathaniel arcand   after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war  return to liberty  missouri  only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown  
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron  thaddeus rains  harris yulin   is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value  aided by allan pinkerton  timothy dalton  and his infamous detectives who  back then  were just thugs who provided security  
but when ma james  kathy bates  becomes one of their victims  jesse and the rest of the guys  gregory smith  ty oneal  joe stevens  form the jamesyounger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroads supply lines  sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept  
plus theres romance  between jesse and a spunky hometown gal  lee mimms  ali larter   
working from a politicallycorrect  clich  drenched  sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers  director les mayfield keeps the action fastpaced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can  
the choppy editing hurts but russell boyds cinematography  luke reichles designer duds and trevor rabins music lend authenticity  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    american outlaws  is a galloping  formulaic   
its the wild west revisited as a date movie
