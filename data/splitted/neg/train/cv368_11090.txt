underwater science fiction stays submerged 
sphere a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman 
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents  
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered  
psychologist norman goodman  dustin hoffman  is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash  
when he arrives at the site  he discovers that there is no plane  but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting    feet below the surface for almost  years  
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact  he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship  
his group as outlined in his report  consists of beth halperin  sharon stone   a biochemist  harry adams  samuel l  jackson   a mathematician  and ted fielding  liev schreiber   an astrophysicist  
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blowoff project for goodman who did it for the money and named his thencolleagues to the team  
  after all   he explains   who reads government documents   
lead by harold barnes  peter coyote   a top secret federal operative  the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel  
once there they stroll over  knock on the door and explore the stilloperational ufo  
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere  
when adams enters the sphere  the weirdness unfolds  
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer  
  my name is jerry  
i am happy  flashes across the screen  
this is unsettling for the psychologist  
  what happens if jerry gets mad   he asks  
barnes is more pragmatic  he needs a last name because he cant put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry  
then the situation turns bad  
deadly beasts appear from nowhere  
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel  
lethal sea snakes attack goodman  
a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading     leagues under the sea   
the suspicious scientists turn against each other  
this has all the makings of a firstrate thinking mans science fiction film  
however even the finest ingredients dont go very far in the hands of a chief who doesnt seem to care about his product  
director barry levinson has churned out a mishmosh that doesnt engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes  
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification  
its much like speedreading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances  
it doesnt get any better when the action scenes begin  
while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles  the people are still flat  
oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them  
after adams experiences the interior of the sphere  no one bothers to ask him what happened  
their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited  
even goodman and halperins illconceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing  
her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing  
theres a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending  but here they are far too obvious  
when an emergency minisub is explained  you know whats going to happen  
the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting  
chapter headings that divide the movie have no function  
the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos  
much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow  
although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable  a great deal of it isnt  
even a science fiction film must be internally consistent  
theres too much here that doesnt make sense  
are the manifestations real  
the jellyfish kill queen latifa  in a throwaway role  and the squid nearly destroys the outpost  but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect  
a scene in the sub suggests that its illusion  but earlier episodes indicate that its not  
not everything has to be explained to death  but there are major questions that the film never answers  
where the ship came from is clarified  but how it ended up on the ocean floor in  is merely alluded to  
even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll  
the climax is followed by  minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale  
after prerelease audience testing  the actors were called back to reshoot the ending  
its difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse  
following the recent tradition of lengthy films  this weighs in at over two very long hours  
the weak scenes could have been cut  but then there wouldnt have been much left  
the movie was supposedly held up by effects work  but theres nothing special on the screen  
we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm  
stealing from  alien    the abyss  and the disastrous  event horizon   this film has learned nothing from them  
remarkably levinson and hoffmans other currently showing film is  wag the dog   a smart and entertaining piece of work  
this one could have been titled the same sans one word
