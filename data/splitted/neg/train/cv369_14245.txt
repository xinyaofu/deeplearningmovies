renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jeanclaude van damme on the action stars  pairing with dennis rodman  doubleteam  and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick  stylish  and somewhat diverting action timekiller  
tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels  knockoff  but this time around  style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous  and at worst incomprehensible  nor hide a host of truly lousy performances  
writer steven e  desouzas fairly straightforward plotline isnt as outre as doubleteams strange yarn involving a secret think tankprison  but it makes about as much sense  which is little  
van damme plays marcus ray  a hong kongbased sales rep for a jeans company    who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchipsized bombs in hk product exports to the u  s  dolls  electronic equipment  and  yes  jeans  
its all part of some type of ransom scheme  but all i remember isand i kid you notgraphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world  bombs detonating  and an hatwearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter    
    which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout knockoff  
while all of van dammes films have its share of unintentional laughs  mostly due to the stiff acting  skills  of the physically agile van damme  knockoff delivers more than usual  though not as many as van dammes embarrassing directorial effort  s thequest   
a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza   i smoked that badass like a roman candle   
and  entrepreneurship  babycakes   
standing out among my favorites  
but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of knockoffs laughs  
van damme is true to laughable form  perhaps even worse than usual  
early scenes actually require him to make funny with costar rob schneider  improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcuss business partner   and the sight and sound of the stillheavilyaccented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way  
even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug  
paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneiders cia superior  and lela rochon  playing an investigator for the jeans company  spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode  
in rochons defense  though  her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs  exquisite bone structure  and perky bosoms  the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage  
tsui picks up where he left off visually in doubleteam  juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work  
here  though  tsuis visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill  coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise  
for each nifty trick tsui pulls off  such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices  there are others that are completely superfluous  
this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context  
for instance  one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box  
as he puts his hand in  the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen  
its undoubtedly an interesting visual  but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something  
the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences  but surprisingly  those in knockoff leave much to be desired  
tsui does what he can to make something of them  employing freeze frames  blurred motion  and unconventional camera angles  but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza  
there isnt anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tigerland mine fight in doubleteam  let alone anything remotely close to tsuis legendary hong kong works  but thats a given going in   
if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woos stateside success  he would do best to break free from van damme    
before its too late  
if he continues his involvement with bgrade movies such as knockoff  the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish    
that is  if it hasnt already disappeared entirely after this fiasco
