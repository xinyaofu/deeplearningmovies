i want to be involved in show business one day  
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse  
this movie proves it for me  
i was a little worried about the last batman film  as i thought joel schumaccer  taking over from tim burton  would screw it up  
i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne  
they didnt  
kilmer did a good job  and the cast was left to carry the movie  which they did  even jim carrey as the riddler and i cant stand jim carrey   because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles  
this film is different  
the cast is still impressive  but here  not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction  hes one of those directors whos good with actors  terrible with camera angles   but writer akiva goldsmith doesnt really give an impressive cast anything to do  
the cast is impressive  clooney is a surprisingly good waynebatman  odonnell is a crafty robin as usual  they couldve casted somebody better as batgirl  my friend likes neve campbell   but silverstone is not bad  and thurman is a good poison ivy  
the major problem is schwarzenegger  who is a terrible freeze  
his accent is so heavy  you cant understand what he says  and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act  and they know it  but they figure that if they flex their muscles  say a limited amount of stuff  and kill a bunch of guys  then they figure nobodyll notice  
thats the trouble with me   i  notice  
schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney  or as much money as he got for this  but hollywood thinks he does  
patrick stewart was the person id heard that was considered to play freeze  and he wouldve been so much better  
or sean connery  but not arnold  im not an actor  but i play one in real life  schwarzenegger  
i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film  but it wouldve been nice if theyd casted a star that had talent for the role  
akiva goldsmiths screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film  
in a regular batman film  theyd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more  but elle macphersons julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is  
there is talk of a fifth batman movie  
my interest to see it is low  but i hope its better than this  
if you dont want to waste your time  rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster  
any other
