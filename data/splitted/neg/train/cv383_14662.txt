  holy man  boasts a sweet  gentle  comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits  
unfortunately  to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long setup  loads of tedious filler  interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching  a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggias career  
if ever a movie screamed  wait for video so you can fastforward through all the dull and annoying parts   this is it  
eddie murphy plays g  a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message  
a chance meeting with ricky hayman  goldblum   a stressedout executive of a homeshopping channel  and kate newell  kelly preston   a nononsense media analyst  results in physical injury to g  quicker than you can say  the odd couple   g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky  
after some script gymnastics  g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network  wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations  enraging network owner mr  mcbainbridge  loggia   and becoming a national media sensation  
  holy man  attempts to be several things at once  
it tries to satirize home shopping networks  but its difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a selfparody  
the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts  but thats common knowledge already  
  holy man  also tries to present a story of redemption  as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit gs good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career  
anyone want to place a wager on his final decision  
the one genuine asset in  holy man  is eddie murphy  who gives a charming performance  sharing love  good will and relevant advice to all those around him  while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments  
murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever hes onscreen  
unfortunately  hes not onscreen enough  
jeff goldblum gets the lions share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down  
as his potential love interest  kelly preston tries to brighten things up  but she transforms from an allbusiness media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance  
the other principal actor  robert loggia  wastes his talents in a onenote turn as a ruthless  screaming monster  
structurally unsound and way too long   holy man  is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isnt  
instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle  wait until it hits video and fastforward past everything except the murphy scenes  
g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and thats the best way to do so
