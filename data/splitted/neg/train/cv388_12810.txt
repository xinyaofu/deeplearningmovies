ugh  that about sums this movie up  
just  ugh  
the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic  and when reviewing the previous films  each film had a certain degree of intelligence  
and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following  in spite of bad special effects  horrible dubbing  and a man in a lizard suit  they maintained a certain degree of    how to put this     
dignity  
not quite the word im looking for  
you understand  right  
and in  years  godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever  
leave it to america to screw the whole thing up  
from the geniuses that brought us  independece day   arguably the worst scifi movie of all time  to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had  
while they do bring us eyepopping special effects that will amaze you  they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies  a storyline  
summing up the movie is simple  
heck  i can do it in one sentence  giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it  
simple as that  
matthew broderick stumbles over his lines  and its hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dogwalking character on the television show  mad about you   
the dialogue seems to be improvized  almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all  
i can see the scene on the set right now  
  all right  
we spent all of this money making big special effects  and weve gotta get this movie out by summer or its going to bomb in our faces  
so  you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head  all right  
make up something  mkay  
good  
roll film    
the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing  and some of the cinemtography is welldone  the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind   
still  an hour into it  you will become antsy  wondering how long they can drag it out  
and drag it out they do   
i have to laugh  
the slogan for the film is   size does matter   
i think they cut this too short  
it should read   size does matter  
acting does not
