ripe with explosions  mass death and really weird hairdos  tsui harks  double team  must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jeanclaude van damme needs another notch on his bad moviebedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career  
actually  in  double team   neithers performance is all that bad  
ive always been the one critic to defend van damme  he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars  namely steven seagal  never aim for  its just that hes never made a movie so exuberantly witty since s  timecop   
and rodman    
well  hes pretty much rodman  
hes extremely colorful  and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t  even if the role is that of an excia weapons expert  
its the story that needs some major work  
van damme plays counterterrorist operative jack quinn  who teams up with arms dealer yaz  rodman  to rub out deadly gangster stavros  mickey rourke  all beefy and weirdlooking  in an antwerp amusement park  the job is botched when stavros son gets killed in the gunfire  and quinn is taken off to an island known as  the colony   a think tank for soldiers  too valuable to kill  but  too dangerous to set free   
quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife  natacha lindinger   but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her  
so  whats a kickboxing mercenary to do  
quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman  kill stavros  save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do  
with crazy  often eyepopping camera work by peter pau and rodmans lite brite locks   double team  should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure  
but too much tries to happen in each frame  and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated  
the numerous action scenes are loud and headacheinducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about whats going on in the movie  
and much of whats going on is just wacky  
theres a whole segment devoted to netsurfing monks that i have yet to figure out  
and the climax finds quinn going headtohead with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle  trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinns baby boy  whos in a bomb equipped basket   all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers  
did i mention  double team  is strange  
when it all comes down  this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon  albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity  
rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona  though  leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs  
but we didnt need  double team  to tell us he could do that  did we
