yeah  yeah  the advertisements didnt even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook  sex  
neve campbell and starship troopers denise richards getting it on  
ok  
yeah  its a decent two minutes of film erotica  but even if thats your main interest in this film  theres plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes  
wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however  
nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing  or at least curious to see the next turn  throughout the entire movie  
but this fastpaced  razorsharp turning of events doesnt leave much time to enjoy the surprises  
we start off in a highclass california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making  
guidance counselor sam lombardo  matt dillon  seems to catch the eye of every student  particularly kelly van ryan  richards   daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts  
right off the bat  kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce  mr  lombardo   
the fundraiser car wash seems the opportune time  particularly when you wash your guidance counselors jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure youll be soaked from head to toe when youre done  
on the weekend of the car wash  kellys attempts at seduction fall flat  and when they do  she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day  
naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations  
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a lowclass  marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller  campbell  comes forth with a near identical story  also involving her trusted guidance counselor  
pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians  sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney  ken bowden  played by bill murray  
yes  that bill murray  
sound like a good  complete movie  
yes  that alone could have been  but this is just the beginning  
in fact  the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film  
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time  
by the time the movie finishes  you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable  
unfortunately  with so much going on  youre not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about  
this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it couldve been  
the  minutes fly by  and although it never feels underdeveloped  this pretzel of storytelling couldve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken  
the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox primetime soap operas  which no  is not a good thing  
and its not just campbell  who happens to hail from the primetime fox soap  party of five   but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones  
dillon  who was so charming in his understated role in last years in  out  gives the best performance  and murrays surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film  
in fact  if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy  even if it was the exact same film  i would actually give it a better grade  
thats how cheezy it comes off  
but aside from these two  the rest offer nothing more than some good eyefulls  
in the right hands  wild things couldve been a wickedly delightful  scrumptiously twisted thriller  but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting  
and whats up with these people passing as high school students  
i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles  but when i realized it wasnt supposed to be a college they were at  i had to snicker  
i wont lie  this is definitely a guilty pleasure  
as corny as it is  its got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a  b  for effort  
but if you just want to admire denise richards  go for last years starship troopers  which was every bit as campy  but a million times better  
of course  if seeing her breasts is your most important goal  youll be right at home with wild things  
perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters
