not so long ago  men by the names of peckinpah  ford  leone  and eastwood made westerns  
real westerns  
these were some of the best films of the twentieth century  
those days are gone  
now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western  
and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws  
outlaws is yet another retelling of the jesse james legend  courtesy of bmovie king james g  robinson  producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor   
delayed since the spring  this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell  the best part of schumachers tigerland  as the badass jesse james  
alas  any sense of his character has been left on the ranch  leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter  minus the whipped cream  to watch  
the spin this time around  fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war  jesse james  farrell   his brother frank  gabriel macht   and his pal cole younger  scott caan  lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended  
but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains  harris yulin  and his cronies rollin parker  terry oquinn  and allan pinkerton  timothy dalton  demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads  
the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad  by robbing banks up and down missouri  thus cutting off the railroads financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people  
along the way  the boys squabble over whos the cutest of the gang  whos the most popular cowboy in the gang  and who ought to go on mtvs total request live  
they rob numerous banks with identical interiors  always with the kindest of hearts  strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background  
the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card  
the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell  
after a great job in tigerland  farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in  seconds  
and his american accent rivals richard geres irish accent in the jackal  
combined with feeling like bonanza  the teen years  this homogenized production  toned down to get the everpopular pg rating  gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring  
the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged  sucking out any energy left in the film  
not to mention  the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws  
instead  the movie is full of old  outrageous tales about the wild west  tales which went out of style in cent magazines about a century ago
