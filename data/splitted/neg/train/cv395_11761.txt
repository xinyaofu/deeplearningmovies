part buddy comedy  part fishoutofwater story  part nature tale  meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes  
in fact  it is an invitation you ought to disregard  
phil and stew deedle  paul walker and steve van wormer  are the twin sons of the famous millionaire  elton deedle  eric braeden   founder of deedle enterprises  
elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune    instead 
the two are careless hawaiian surf bums  
to set them straight  he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp  to which the pair inevitably go  
after several misadventures in wyoming  where the duo is stunned to discover theres no surf  the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot  
they arrive at yellowstone national park  where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits  
rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad  the deedles play along  
phil  actually  has other motives  the beautiful park ranger jesse  a  
j  langer   who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine  john ashton   
yellowstone has a problem  
its only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday  and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs  
not just one or two    thousands of them  
the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p  dog menace  not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater  dennis hopper   
the brothers deedle arent supposed to be outandout stupid  like the team from dumb and dumber  or bill and ted  
instead  their brains just operate in a different  simpler  realm  
a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board  a film which  unfortunately  this one resembles in several hideous ways  
the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isnt funny  
theres a moment when phil utters the line   insert laugh here   which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience  
the result isnt bad in a runshriekingfromthetheater type of way  
instead  its merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way  
the cast seems decent  but theyre never asked to do anything remotely interesting  
instead  the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people andor cars rolling downhill in the forest  and with constant annoying references to other disney films  
youll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles
