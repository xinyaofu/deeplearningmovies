adam sandler isnt known for appearing in deep  thoughtprovoking films  but hes still a really funny guy  
most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them  but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out  
big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandlers comic performance  and its a miserable failure  
sandler plays a thirtysomething loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy  played by cole and dylan sprouse   
as one might expect from the synopsis  director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences  including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say  goodbye  to one another  in addition  theres a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor  urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself   
theres a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters  and the film features passable performances from sandler  joey lauren adams  as the love interest   and the two young boys  but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny
