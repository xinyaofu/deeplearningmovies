im not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing  disturbing behavior  with  scream   
maybe its because theyre both horror films  kinda   both have hot young stars  both have an annoying alternative soundtrack  and both are aimed at the teenage crowd  which i guess includes me  
but this is not the next in line with the  scream  flicks as well as the  i know what you did last summer  soon to be flicks  
it owes less to  halloween  and more to kafka and orwell  which  in my book  makes for a more interesting feature  
and it should have been  
this is basically a rehash of  the stepford wives   the great s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing  as ive been told  with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives  
or something like that  
  behavior   starring katie holmes of  dawsons creek   deals with a bunch of teenagers  deep in angst  who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers  
suckups  
preppies  
it actually  at least to me  sounds like it would work  and with scott rosenberg  that witty penmen who has written stuff like  beautiful girls  and  things to do in denver when youre dead   as well as  con air    it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit  
alas  its not  and it plumets into that little group of movies known as  the movies with potential that blow it   
i remember a film called  white mans burden  which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with its potentially brilliant premise  
heres another one  
it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves  
its a stage  and this film does in fact realize that  
it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly  
now it just needs to work as a film  
which it doesnt  
its too sloppy and too contrived  
it paints a bleak portrait of high school life    then 
lets it lie  
it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kissups who do food drives and hang out at a s diner drinking milk shakes    then 
gives it a cheap twist  when they get horny  they become homicidal  
isnt it scary enough that theyre like this  and cant the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them  not that you could be next to die  
the film introduces us two three different characters who  in the beginning  are considered outsiders because theyre not  yet  part of this clique  the new kid  steve  james marsden  dull dull dull dull   whos having trouble at home because he hasnt gotten over his brothers  ethan embry  in quick flashes so you dont recognize him  i did  suicide  the renegade girl  rachel  katie holmes  from  dawsons creek    whos chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring  and by far the most interesting kid  gavin  nick stahl  the kid from  the man without a face    whos the most interesting because hes the only character whos given some dimension  
in the films best scene  he introduces steve to every single clique  nailing each ones fetishes and hangups  and its the best scene in the movie because its witty  satirical  and interesting  something the rest of this film isnt  
gavin suspects theres something awry with the preppie kids  known as the blue ribbons  and in the tradition of all conspirators  and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve  hes only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff  
here  we have another case of  the idiot plot   where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him  but he may have saved this film from being the dreary  dull film that it is without gavin  who gives it life and humor  
the only other halfinteresting character is the school janitor  played by william sadler as a retarded  scary guy who may not be what he seems to be    but 
really  we dont care anyway  
i probably shouldnt mention that this was directed by david nutter  whos works for  the xfiles   because that would probably tarnish his reputation  
like the show  hes good at setting up weird conspiracies  and creating a general creepy feel  
most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect  and some of it works  
but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff  
he keeps too much inside  so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act  you wonder why they just dont get the hell out of there  
i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that theres something rotten in the state of teen angstdom  
what this film needs to be is a lot longer  a lot more colorful  and a lot creepier  
if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor  played by bruce greenwood  an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent  who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed  then they need to come up with a tougher  smarter villain  
if hes so villainous  then why could two dense teenagers who couldnt figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes  
the film  which runs about  or so minutes  just needs to work on these things  and become a lot less sloppy  
at such a short running time and with such lame  boring characters as these  its pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in ones mouth  especially mine
