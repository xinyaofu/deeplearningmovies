in the interest of being generous  i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins  playing a superrich media mogul  has gathered his family around him for dinner  
his oldest daughter  played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing   who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party  presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes  which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake  
the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes  
hopkins  frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair  does what any man in his position would do  he punts  
whichever one you like  dear  he says  
and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do  she cries  
i liked that scene for two reasons  
first  the cakes looked really cool  
second  it was  perhaps  the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  
meet joe black is chockfull of odd performances  people doing things for no discernible reason at all  and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot  
its easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani  but its even easier to sleep right through it  two people on my row managed it quite nicely   
the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess  
i know my audience had problems with the movie  because they thought it was a comedy  
case in point  everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie  
however  the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani  
  its not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death  but it makes a certain kind of sense   
it shouldnt take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  
and indeed they do  after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt   because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished  
well  when that happened  the audience howled with laughter  and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous  
so  if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawingroom humor are funny  i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately  
anyway  the deceased lawyers body  no worse the wear from its massive injuries  is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role  
the idea is that death  given the pen name of joe black  so as not to disturb others  wants to take a holiday and experience the world  
if this werent hollywood  we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death  but since it is  we get scene after scene of fishoutofwater humor  just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck whos wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesnt know how to act in our society  
it also doesnt help that the character of death is written so inconsistently  
he claims to be on vacation  but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani  just try to get your travel agent to book that one   
he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois  
he knows everything about some characters  nothing about others  
and as played by brad pitt  hes not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing  hes just there  
its as if someone told pitt   never mind about acting in this picture  son  just stand there and look pretty   
its as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie  
ive used the phrase  angel of death  in this review very deliberately to contrast pitts performance with this years best angel performance  nicolas cages in city of angels  
where pitt is cold and unfeeling  cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows  
where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man  pitt is aloof and arrogant  
cage struck instant chemical sparks with costar meg ryan  where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlanis character is so shallow that she cant see beyond pitts good looks  
the movies other top name is a much better actor  but that doesnt save meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins isnt given much better material to work with  unfortunately  
he plays one of these goodhearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood  
  one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkinss character more realistically evil   
hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker  but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world  
of course  no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder  
but i have to wonder  and in this movie  you have a very long time to wonder  how you or i would act in a similar situation  especially if you or i were a multimillionaire  
hopkins pretty much goes to the office  and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation  
fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated  im sure  
i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black  and im asking myself why  
movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest  which is what im going to do now  
go spend time with your family  go volunteer for a local charity  heck  go take a nap  
dont go see meet joe black  because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death
