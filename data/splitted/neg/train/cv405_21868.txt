arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts  since the late s  but lately his films have been very sloppy and the oneliners are getting worse  
its hard seeing arnold as mr  freeze in batman and robin  especially when he says tons of ice jokes  but hey he got  million  whats it matter to him  
once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster  that cant compare with the likes of the terminator series  true lies and even eraser  
in this so called dark thriller  the devil  gabriel byrne  has come upon earth  to impregnate a woman  robin tunney  which happens every  years  and basically destroy the world  but apparently god has chosen one man  and that one man is jericho cane  arnold himself   
with the help of a trusty sidekick  kevin pollack   they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world  
parts of this are actually so absurd  that they would fit right in with dogma  
yes  the film is that weak  but its better than the other blockbuster right now  sleepy hollow   but it makes the world is not enough look like a  star film  
anyway  this definitely doesnt seem like an arnold movie  
it just wasnt the type of film you can see him doing  
sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known oneliners  but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going  
its understandable  especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources  
aside form that  he still walked through it  much like he has in the past few films  
im sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days  
speaking of action  where was it in this film  
there was hardly any explosions or fights  
the devil made a few places explode  but arnold wasnt kicking some devil butt  
the ending was changed to make it more spiritual  which undoubtedly ruined the film  
i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred  but once again i was let down  
i also dont know why the film took so long and cost so much  
there was really no super affects at all  unless you consider an invisible devil  who was in it for  minutes tops  worth the overpriced budget  
the budget should have gone into a better script  where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom  
its pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie  
do they even read these things anymore  
it sure doesnt seem like it  
thankfully gabriels performance gave some light to this poor film  
when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney  you cant help but feel that he looked like a devil  
the guy is creepy looking anyway  
when its all over  youre just glad its the end of the movie  
dont bother to see this  if youre expecting a solid action flick  because its neither solid nor does it have action  
its just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing  due to a strategic marketing campaign  
save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience
