the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john mayburys love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon  
as always  jacobis acting is impeccable  but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque  
the movie convincingly argues that francis  played by jacobi  was a completely despicable and vain individual  but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude  
when interviewed by a fawning talk show host  francis calls his style  chance brushstrokes   
starting with a burglary of franciss flat  the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie  
the camera shots are heavy on the avantgarde angles  lots of wideangle closeups and distorted shots filmed through coloredglass reflections  
the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man  
daniel craig  in a lifeless performance  plays the burglar and boxer  george dyer  
when francis lays eyes on him after the breakin  francis promises not to call the police if hell stay for sex  
he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed  
he thinks that franciss paintings have  no bloody use   and the movie presents no counterargument  
writer maybury barely outlines franciss character  and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma  
we learn little of george other than franciss reason for liking him  georges  amorality and innocence   
franciss love of sadomasochism is shown early and often  
  boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex   he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match  
as the fighters head is sliced open with a heavy blow  the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood  
francis appears to be in complete ecstasy  
another of franciss favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities  
as the carnage mounts  we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience  
in a film that tries obsessively to shock  one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident  
franciss mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother  the father  and the boy  
sometimes the script throws us tidbits of franciss wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful  
   im optimistic by nature  
im optimistic about nothing   
  loneliness is my only true companion    
we learn more details about franciss makeup techniques than about the man himself  
he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth  
full of metaphorical interpretations  the films best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom  
mistaking franciss picture of a toilet for the genuine article  he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly  
like a parody of a bad art house movie  love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling  
by the end  the audience hasnt learned any more than it could have in a threeminute sketch  
love is the devil runs     
the film is not rated but should be considered nc for violence  profanity  graphic sex  nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers
