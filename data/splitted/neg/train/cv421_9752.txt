the cartoon is way better  
thats the bottom line on disneys incredibly hyped live action version of its  animated feature  
the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic  home alone  with puppies  and not much else  
when production of this remake was announced  the big question seemed to be  why  
the original cartoon still works  so whats the point   
the answer  it appears  is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign  
the story  for those of you who missed childhood  is simple  
two dalmatians  pongo and perdy  fall in love at first sight  
they drag their  human pets  together  and in a short time both couples marry  
the heavenly matchups turn chaotic when pongo and perdys newborn pups are stolen  their dognapping engineered by the evil cruella devil  who wants them for their pelts  
everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies  
in the original movie  the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities  
we also could hear them talk  which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film  the dogs view of humans as their pets  
in the new version  the dogs are mute and expressionless  
hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks  
while he drew the desired  aww  theyre so cute  reaction from the audience  it was quickly followed by several people whispering  i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dogs heads to get them licking like that   
the canines lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little  
joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles  
in previous films  daniels successfully played off his white bread persona  
in  something wild   he revealed the rebellious thrillseeker beneath his neutral demeanor  
in  terms of endearment   his hapless appearance masked a cold  manipulative womanizer  
here  he and richardson are so consistently bland that its a wonder their images even stick to the film  
glenn close  however  has no problems establishing a distinct personality  
as the villainous icon cruella devil  she tears up the screen in a deliciously overthetop performance  
close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself  
with a twotone fright wig  red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips  garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels  close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature  
shes clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon  and her wicked glee is infectious  
when she spits out lines like  youve won the battle  but im about to win the wardrobe    
the film comes briefly to life  
   dalmatians  is crammed with john hughes typical heavyhanded approach to comedy  
after an ingenuous opening showing pongos morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day  the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park  a little slapstick goes a long way  but hughes just keeps laying it on  
the second half of the film  where local animals team up to rescue  nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen  is a tedious home alone clone  with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy  scratchy cartoon  including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence  
   dalmatians  has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close  but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick  bland characters  and unconvincing animatronic raccoons highfiving one another
