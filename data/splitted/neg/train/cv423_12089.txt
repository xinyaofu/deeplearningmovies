from a major league baseball radio broadcast  featuring playby play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown  with special guest commentator james berardinelli  
hc  as we go to the top of the th  were joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli  whos here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie  major league  back to the minors  the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors  
nice to see you  jim  
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer  can you give us the scoop on the new flick  
jb  my opinion  the producers should have stopped while they were ahead  and that was nine years ago  
one entry was definitely enough  and im surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league   this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released directtovideo  
its worse than a mediocre madefortv feature  
i should also mention that this movie likely wont play all that well in cleveland  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders  they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
actually  most of the action involves the twins aaa minor league club  the buzz  rather than the actual major league franchise  
hc  sorry to interrupt  jim  but we still have to do playbyplay for the game on the field  
leading off this inning is john warren  
he steps into the batters box and takes kents pitch low for ball one  
wh  so  the storys strictly minor league  right  
whats it about  
jb  scott bakula  the guy from quantum leap  plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell  
when twins owner roger dorn  once again portrayed by corbin bernsen  needs a new manager for his aaa team  he offers the job to gus  who is now faced with two daunting tasks  turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson  played by walt goggins  for a promotion to  the show   
with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano  dennis haysbert   rube baker  eric bruskotter   and isuro tanaka  takaaki ishibashi   gus gets the buzz on the right track  
in fact  he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the bigleague club  leonard huff  played with overthetop relish by ted mcginley   
soon  dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus overachieving group against huffs overpaid  lastplace bunch  
wh  can we guess who wins  
jb  the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when youve already seen the box score  
on top of that  none of the mockups are presented with much flair  
theyre not just boring  theyre lackluster  
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension  theyve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs  
hc  warren fouls off a fastball  
 and   
wh  are there lots of yuks in this one  
jb  not one  from start to finish  
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny  
okay  a lot of the jokes were sophomoric  but they made me laugh  
the two sequels havent just been stale  but their humor quotient has been abysmally low  
even bob ueckers oncesharp oneliners have turned lame  and theyre the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing  
hc  heres the  pitch  
looooooong drive  fair or foul  foul ball  
the count goes to  and   
wh  does the film at least get the baseball details correct  
jb  yes  
there arent any glaring errors like there were in one of the bestever baseball movies  the natural  
but id gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story  believable characters  or even a little genuine humor  
heck  the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league  back to the minors  
wh  its nice to see old friends one more time  isnt it  
like cerrano  tanaka  and dorn  
jb  depends on whether you really care that anyone is back  
there arent any real characters here  just an assortment of cliched oddballs  
yeah  the voodoo hitter  the catcher who cant throw back to the pitcher  the japanese player  and the conceited playerturnedowner have all returned  but who really cares  
they have no depth  
notable absences include tom berengers veteran and charlie sheens  wild thing   
we dont really miss them  though  
hc  breaking ball  low and outside  
 and   
wh  so youre saying that we should give this one a miss  
jb  thats right  
to use baseball terminology  its a threepitch strikeout  
if youre looking for a good movie that involves baseball  try popping the natural  field of dreams  bull durham  or even the first major league into the vcr  
actually  this is an oddlytimed release  since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters  
even the minor league seasons are already underway  
dont bother with major league  back to the minors  
its a wretched time waster  
wh  thanks for the advice  
jb  youre welcome  
hc  and heres the  pitch  
fouled back  right into this booth  
hey  jim  heads up  
oops  
somebody better get him some ice for that  
he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies  but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls  
odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him  almost as if he has a grudge to settle  
anyway  back to the action on the field
