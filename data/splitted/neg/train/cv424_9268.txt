its time to take cover  
after a hiatus of about fifteen years  the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
in early   there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone  one on television and two in the theaters  with dantes peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  
of the two  i had heard that dantes peak was the better film  so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky  crushing homes and people  
we see people panicking  people crying  and even horses rearing  
it is a disaster of biblical proportions  signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  
symbolism doesnt get much more blatant than that  
we learn that harry dalton  pierce brosnan   a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey  was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  
harry survived  but his wife did not  
a few years later  harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dantes peak  washington  which  we are told  has been voted second most desirable place to live  under     by the readers of money magazine   
there harry meets rachel wando  a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dantes peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  
although the mayor doesnt seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up  a few members of the city council are  
they are afraid that harrys presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dantes peak  
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  
however  when an amorous young couple takes a skinnydip in the local hot springs  they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption  
this film contains a number of cliches  
the amorous couple is one  
as soon as they doff their clothes  you know theyre going to die  
the town busybody and the abrasive motherinlaw make appearances  as does the deathdefying dog  
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable  
watching the movie  i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements  but some of the dialogue as well  
unfortunate  since much of the dialog is terrible  
for example  harrys boss  paul  charles hallahan   and a team from the u  s  geological survey join harry to assess the situation  
paul basically tells the townsfolk that harrys eruption predictions arent cause for alarm  
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage  only to turn up the next day  ready for work  
when paul asks harry why he stayed  he says with grim determination   cause this towns in trouble and im the best man youve got   
even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving  
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water  
if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up  however  the frog wont move and will allow itself to be cooked  
  is that your recipe for frog soup   
asks one of the team members  
  its my recipe for disaster   responds harry  
dantes peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious  
our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid  
mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming  in a very grave tone   acid eats metal   
thanks for the tip  
when we first see the u  s  geological survey building  theres a caption labeling it as such  
this wouldnt have been so bad if it werent for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads  in large letters   u  s  geological survey   
i suppose the caption is for people who cant read signs  
although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film  the viewer has no idea why  
there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters  and the relationship seems rushed because of this  
when they get close to kissing  i was asking myself   why do they want to kiss  
were they even attracted to each other   
if i were the mayor  i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesnt even crack a smile through the whole movie  trying to pull off the roughyetdebonair act  
who does he think he is  
james bond  
the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed  
there are several  warning signs  prior to the eruption itself  but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we dont feel as if they are leading up to anything  
for example  one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot  
a tremor occurs  
does he plunge headlong to his death  
is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below  
no  a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg  
the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene  which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well  
it wasnt  
one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dantes peak  
in a disaster movie  theres usually one guy whos greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruptionfireearthquakeexplosiontsunamitornadometeorite  and usually gets killed by the disaster  
its okay  of course  because we all think he got what he deserved  
if youre going to be unoriginal  you might as well go all the way  
in dantes peak  the city councilmembers are concerned  but they dont really try hard enough  
maybe the mayors abrasive motherinlaw should have been the one  
for no apparent reason  she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt  
perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate  
there are a couple of good things about this movie  
the first is the scenery  
there are panoramic shots of forests  lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful  
the second is the special effects  
they are the closest ive ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption  
but when elements which dont speak are going to be the best parts of your movie  youd probably better rewrite the script
