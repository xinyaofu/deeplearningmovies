  deep rising  gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively  not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squidlike menace  but the unfolding story is artificial  silly and almost completely derivative of countless other  and  for the most part  better  films  
while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures  take  for example  the schlocky mountain highs of last springs  anaconda    deep rising  has no tongue to put in its cheek  
folks  were only a month into the new year  and already heres a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases  
most of the action takes place on the argonautica  a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage  uhoh  if these people had seen  titanic   then maybe theyd have known to stay home  when its attacked by a giant  tentacled sea creature  
the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian  famke janssen   argonautica owner canton  anthony heald  and a few other crew members  
a mercenary team  lead by resourceful captain john finnegan  treat williams   board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby  
but what their search of the ship uncovers is something bloodsoaked  hungry and not very helpful  
the main problem with  deep rising  is its overt familiarity  the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most scifihorror films in recent memory  
the concept is  leviathan  meets  titanic   with a dash of  speed   thrown in for good  or is that bad   
measure  
this monster is equal parts     leagues under the sea  and  the relic   knows how to open doors like the raptors from  jurassic park  and even gets to expel a halfdigested victim  a neat effect  admittedly  a la the giant snake in  anaconda   
some of the attack sequences are straight out of  jaws  and  alien   
a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of  alien resurrection   
theres even a jet ski chase like  hard rain   
and the list goes on  
watching  deep rising  s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself  because none of them have welldeveloped characters  nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy  
williams is affable enough  but his finnegan just isnt believable  
an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted  pretty famke janssen  best known as  goldeneye  s killer thighs  is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams  while kevin j  oconnor  as finnegans mechanic  provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast  
djimon honsou  who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in decembers  amistad   pops up in a brief part  
he needs to stay away from the water  
the movies final shot is a groaner  as is the thhour regurgitation of a subplot involving an onship saboteur  
as if a cast deserving of their snack foodfate isnt bad enough  when you taunt the monster  youre really asking for it    deep rising  is a slow  stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot  
and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is  the closer we are to the end of the movie  rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isnt out of the question
