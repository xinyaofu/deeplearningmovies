  mandingo  has traditionally been seen as one of two things  either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south  or in the words of film critic leonard maltin   a trashy potboiler  that  appeals only to the sm crowd   
actually  i think  mandingo  is a strange combination of the two  although it fails on both fronts  
its too trashy to be good drama  but too dramatic to be good trash  
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell  james mason  and his son  hammond  perry king   
one day in new orleans  hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede  heavyweight boxer ken norton   
although the movie never explains it  a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  
according to the movie  mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  
meanwhile  hammond has married his cousin  blanche  susan george   because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  
hammond  however  is happier spending nights with his  bed wench   the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  
it is quickly apparent that hammond  despite his overt racism  is more in love with his bed wench  a sensitive slave girl named ellen  brenda sykes   than he is with blanche  
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had  pleasured  her before he did  
of course  its fine that hes slept with numerous slave girls  but the fact that his wife  a  white lady   had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  
so blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  
hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child  although its okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond   so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth  and hammond poisons blanche  
hammond then finds mede  shoots him twice in the shoulder  and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  
yes  you read right  the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  
judging only by the plot   mandingo  is pure sexploitation  
the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible  with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in th century southern society  
when  mandingo  was released in   it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail  this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  
dramatically   mandingo  is weak and unfocused  and historically its mostly confused  
if one were to judge history by this film  it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality  not economics  
not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working  except for a few house servants  
the men spend most of the time sitting around  while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  
there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves  but  mandingos  overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick  although theres plenty of violence  fights  vicious beatings  shootings  and the aforementioned human boiling sequence  thrown in for good measure   
some tried to write off  mandingo  as a blaxploitation film  one of a number of quicklymade  lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies  but its not that easy  
  mandingo  was studiofinanced by paramount pictures  and produced by dino de laurentiis  the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as  the bible      the remake of  king kong      and the illfated  dune      
the director was richard fleischer  a veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including     leagues under the sea     and  fantastic voyage      as well as such superior suspense films as  the narrow margin      
the script  based on the supermarket bestseller by ken ostott  and the subsequent play by jack kirkland   was penned by norman wexler  who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on  serpico   
james mason  perry king  and susan george were wellknown and respected actors  mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt   and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career  
so why is  mandingo  so bad  
a number of reasons  including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job  
wexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive  it combines stereotyped slavetalk   yessuh  massuh    stereotyped southern white trash talk   fer whutre you gittin outta bed     and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk   if you see me hang  you gonna know you killed a black brother     
fleischers direction is clumsy  especially during the fight scenes  and all the actors give weak performances  especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable  
nevertheless  credit should be given where credit is due  
despite its exploitative nature   mandingo  was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery  
until then  there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery  
even classics such as  gone with the wind     can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter  
  mandingo  reassessed the south  and showed that it wasnt all beautiful plantations  green fields  and pretty sunsets  
but all this is constantly undermined by the films negligible pointofview  it claims to see things from the black perspective  but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners  
with a little more maturity and different handling   mandingo  might have been an effective  worthwhile film  
while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery  it never deals with them  
the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile  but wexlers script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing  
there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner  but  mandingo  never does it  
steven spielberg touched on that same topic in  schindlers list      by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid  
the difference between that film and  mandingo  is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair  unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma  
  mandingo  is satisfied to simply show some skin  and because of that  its  trashy potboiler  nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished
