the catch phrase for disneys rocket man is one spoken by fred z  randall  harland williams   the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes  
  it wasnt me   he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others  
well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is  williams cant take all the blame  but he sure cant justify himself with his own simple tag line either  
fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy  turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wideeyed at a poster of the earth  
as a yearold  fred hasnt grown up much  but at least hes somewhat closer to his goal  now designing astronaut software for nasa  
when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured  nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void  
  
  
fred  
yes  although hes an obviously klutzy moron  nasa doesnt think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program  and time itself  has ever known  
for the first part of the film  we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park  he laughs  he screams  but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than childs play  
his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recordbreaking feats  much to the dismay of cocky counterpart  mission commander captain overbeck  william sadler   who once held the records  
overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet  one being astronaut julie ford  the stupids jessica lundy   and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist  
from here on out  we are subjected to one lame gag after another  dealing with snot  laxatives  and flatulence  
you know  standard kid movie material  
almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist  williams is awful in his first starring role  
we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and peewee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring  williams would be it  
while hes not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany  stupid comedy  hes just as unlikeable  
to say it more understandably  jim carrey might annoy you more  but this guy is even less funny  
why  
because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role  his performance is too understated and boring  
classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy  
stan laurel  for example  was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him  
peter sellers  as inspector clouseau  was so selfassured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip  it was humor at its best  
williams  on the other hand  cant garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his antiglory  
as for the rest of the cast  including some bigger names in smaller roles  beau bridges and shelley duvall   nobody is worth watching whatsoever  
this is just another example of the fastfood equivalent of cinema  massproduced  less than mediocre  over priced  and hard to stomach  
giving it oneandahalf stars is  extremely  generous  but even ill admit to laughing a few times  
the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids  laughter was something rarely heard  even from the children  
i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didnt crack up over every little thing  
then again  maybe they were asleep  
some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies  claiming adults arent the targeted audience and therefore arent meant to  and wont  enjoy them  
sadly  its also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if its presented right  
a twohour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there  but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast  which could easily do the same thing  
and saying that a parents perspective isnt important is quite a poor theory to have when theyre the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place
