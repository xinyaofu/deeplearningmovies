years ago  robin williams made jumanji  a brilliant achievement in special effects  but a travesty on nearly every other level  
the same can be said for what dreams may come  a boring  illogical  weepiewannabe that left my senses numb  
dont get me wrong  i love breathtaking special effects and pulsepounding imagery  
brazil is on my personal top ten  
the city of lost children is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love  and last year at marienbad  being in the minority amidst my friends  
what dreams may come  imagery aside  has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it does have is never fully realized  
its idea of a plot is so lukewarm  that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences  put on an electronica soundtrack  and sell it as one of those popular minds eye videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen  who dies too prematurelynot only in the story  but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director  vincent ward  and the screenwriter ronald bass  have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the halfhour or so needed to tell his life story first  ala its a wonderful life   so that i can build up respect for him  so i could know and possibly care for him  his children  and his longsuffering wife  played superbly by annabella sciorra   
instead  the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story  expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesnt  
so in the afterlife  chris learns that  a  people still dont meet god   b  that our thoughts are reality  and  c  time does not exist there  
hmm    
ill grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative  
  the  not meeting god  part still irks at me  but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect   
that said  this alternate reality still makes no possible sense  
read on    
chris wife commits suicide  
since suicides go to hell  chris would be separated from his wife forever  
the important question is  is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love  
good question  
and i like good thoughtprovoking questions  
i dont like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question  
i loathe it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film  especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously  
i really loathe it when its story is no longer run by logic  but by special effects  
hey chris  did you forget  
your thoughts are real  
they are more real than the physical world  according to the newage screenplay  
so  why dont you conjure up positive thoughts of annie  and let that run wild  
and then she would appear before you  and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity  
because there would be no movie  thats why  
and albert the angel  played by miscast cuba gooding  jr   says bluntly   thats fantasy   
umm    
if your thoughts are more real than the physical  then fantasy is not fantasy  but real  
surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that  
and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person  and that your thoughts arent big enough to sustain you for eternity  well  in all due respect  thats why i dont subscribe to this theology  
all due respect  
another idea  based on  time   pause   does not exist here   
so chris  spend your eternity with annie  as she is on earth  reliving your favorite memories  or hang out with her when she was growing up  
youve got eternity  perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out  
and forcing her to write  i still exist  in her diary  imo  is just too tacky  
there are many other ideas  all of which are a hundred times better than whats unraveled in the plot  
the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before  and just come out stale  
most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris life appear in heaven differently than he expects  so when they finally show themselves  he realizes they were with him all along  
and when this happens  the film runs in slow motion  as if to build emotion  
gag me with a spoon  
so the only things for me to like are sciorras effective performance  who rises far above this mundane material  and the special effects  
please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals  i did not enjoy all of them  some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe  everybody floating up and down in invisible strings  
it sounds like a joke  but its really true  i really tried to block out the dialogue  and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack  
my vote goes to a rare cd called  never say die     from petra  a christian rock group  
its pretty good  and they have a song about annie  who commits suicide  
  its too late for annieshes gone away for goodtheres so much wed have told herand now we wish we couldbut its too late      
melancholic  yes  
depressing  yes  
but far more entertaining    
so  in case you dont know  let me be straight  
suicidebad  
dont do it  
no  no  no   got it  you 
shouldnt have to pay    to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
