the original babe was my favorite movie of   a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience  
being a surprise commercial and critical success  it had no marketing tieins  which limited its final take  
thus  babe  arrives  with a budget greater than the money made in babe   
plush dolls  vending machines hawking tshirts  and macys thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday moneygrubbing  
too late  
this is a sad review to write  because babe  not only does not live up to the original  but it doesnt even come to a fraction of it  
i shouldnt expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic  but this film tries too hard  and loses its charm  
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity  unaware that his car is in neutral  
imagine with me  if you will  screams jamie kennedy  explaining the  rules  for sequels like babe   
    there must be more talking animals  
    there must be more slapstick comedy  
    there must be more songs for those mice to sing  thats cute  
    keep the story cards to break up the action  thats cute too  even though  the pig gets wise  made no sense  given the context of that story partition  
    there must be action  however illogical  that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original  the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to  the baaramewe secret code  the  thatll do  pig  
thatll do   
now throw in the limitations   a  james cromwell  now a hot commodity  has limited time on the set  or maybe he didnt approve of the script   
  b  christine cavanaugh  the voice of the original babe  demands more money    paltry considering the  million budget   
out  
e  g  
daily comes in with noticable results  
  c  george miller  the director  is more wellknown for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment  not for kiddie fare  and no  he didnt direct that andre film in    
  d  the special effects are impressive  but limited  
babe talks  but most of the time from a single shot  repeated over and over again  
  babe is center screen  looking straight into the camera  with a happy smirkregardless of whether hes happy  or scared  or tired   
season now with the  original  elements  which  as we will find out  are straight from the screenwritingishell bin  
  i  change the venue into  the big city   
this has been praised as wildly original  
excuse me  didnt home alone do this several years ago  
how about the muppets  
even the bad news bears travelled to tokyo  
sorry  
no dice  
side note  to give the city a fairytale look  george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the worlds great cities  and yes  it is impressive  
but this too is overused  repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions  
and  for the most part  babe remains in the hotel  
  ii  given the limitations of cromwell  the human element is taken over by  the boss wife  played by magda szubanski  
stretch  
shes not a lead actresstype  shes not funny enough in her physical comedy  and shes simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls  
  have her arrested falsely on drug charges  
have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes  
have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner   
i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes  but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in  
i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film  the violence  the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge  head submerged underwater  
even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it  as the brothers grimm have demonstrated  
no    my problem is with the story  or lack thereof  
babe is sent out to save the hoggett farm  but once in the city  that story is forgotten  
being a goodnatured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice  but  other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull  what did babe actually do  
without giving the ending away  the farm is saved from a leftfield quirk that had nothing to do with the pig  
speaking of  pig   or   pigpigpigpigpig    
the word  pig  is so overused  had they changed it to an expletive  and had the pig be al pacino  i could have been watching scarface  
this is screenwriting  
further  i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups  
had it been a cartoon  and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd  maybe my reaction would have been softened  
but to farmer hoggett  
his wife  
an elderly mickey rooney  
much too irreverent  
   quick  
splice those singing mice into those scenes     
the film isnt a colossal failure  
i did like glenne headleys schmoozy chimpanzee  
i liked the pink poodle  
the dog on the cart  who momentarily thinks hes in dog heaven  
and a weird looking guy who may have been doublycast as an airport employee and a judge  
but most of the time  i was looking down  in boredom  or in embarrassment over the hackedup script  
them singing mice  those chapter partitions  the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for a story  
let me spoil the final scene  farmer hoggett looks at pig  proud  says  thatll do  pig  
thatll do   
thats it  
hope i didnt ruin it for you  
but tell me this  what the heck did that pig do
