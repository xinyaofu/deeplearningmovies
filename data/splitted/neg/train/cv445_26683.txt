phaedra cinema  the distributor of such neverheardof classics as  soft toilet seats    trailer  the movie   and  the one armed boxer vs  the flying guillotine   has sneaked its latest release   the sculptress   into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare  
  the sculptress  is a scary proposition all right  but not in the way its producers intended  
from the outset its easy to see why some of the larger  more reputable chains arent carrying it  the film looks like a straighttovideo release from the early s thats been dusted off  not very carefully  and reissued in theatrical format  
that staple of schlocky zmovies jeff fahey   the lawnmower man   plays a washedup shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills  
when hes not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment  screaming scotchinduced  hamlet  soliloquies well into the night  hes out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women  
faheys dobie sizes up his victims  actually just one  a peep show performer name of sylvie  dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk  and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane  dark glasses  and a false beard  just in time for halloween    
  do you have a castle   
sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop  
  jah  
with ze many turrets  is dobies perplexing reply  
the real  star  of the film  and i use that term extremely loosely  is katie wright  who plays the sculptress of the title  
sarah is new in town  studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a  genius  frenchman  played by the beretwearing patrick bauchau  
thats convenient  because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris  you wont believe the films final shot  with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and  rosemarys baby  inspired imagery   
bauchaus character criticizes sarahs work publicly  her clay busts keep turning into gargoylesperhaps shes possessed    
by an incubus     but he still manages to talk her into dinner  
whereas wright does a decent english accent  her talents pretty much end there  
on the other side of the wall  dobies troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like  actor delivers a stunning macbeth   actor courted by hollywood studio    actor renounces hollywood for priesthood   and  prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal   
the films plot could have been just as easily condensed  
  artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath   
  yawns ensue   
so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes  
late in the film  their paths finally cross with mindnumbing results  
nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket  but one old dear does go ballistic when sarahs bathtub overflows  
no  we dont see wright in the tub  or fahey for that matter   and the gore quotient is virtually nil  so for a horror film  the sculptress  is surprisingly lacking  
the only thing worth looking at is san francisco  and writerdirector ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary  windswept  and deserted  
  the sculptress  isnt even bad enough to be fun  
luckily  a limited release has made it easy to avoid
