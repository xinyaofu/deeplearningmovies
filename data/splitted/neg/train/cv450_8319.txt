a month ago i wrote that speed  was the worst film ive ever reviewed on paper  
i didnt know at the time that id soon encounter and despise batman  robin  which has just overtaken speed  as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer  
as directed by joel schumacher  who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isnt very good at either   b  r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion  
the plot  which has mr  freeze and poison ivy  uma thurman  planning to take over gotham city and then  the vorld   as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states   is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust  partnership  blah  blah  blah  
but morals are not the point of this filmtopping each bloated  confusing action scene with next one is  
the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls  
since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel  
only george clooney comes out on top  he underplays nicely and pretends like hes in a real movie
