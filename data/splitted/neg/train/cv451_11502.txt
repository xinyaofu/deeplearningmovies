call  hush   stop or my mom will kill   
or  mommy fearest   
or  the hand that robs the cradle   
call it whatever you want  but certainly dont see it unless youre in desperate need of a bad movieinduced chuckle   hush  scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure  
chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent postproduction tinkering  it was supposed to open about a year ago   the latter of which appears to have given  hush  a sendoff thats downright infuriating  
its too bad that  hush  is so laughable  because the onscreen talent  including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange  is nothing to laugh at  
paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson  a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy  welltodo familys horse farmestate kilronan  
jacksons mother martha  lange  runs kilronan all by herself  and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately  even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether  caught redhanded after a bedroom romp with her husbandtobe  
but it seems that marthas friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor  shes what youd call someone who loves too much  
martha eagerly  deviously wants a grandchild  and then helen will be expendable  as far as shes concerned  
if theres one reason to catch  hush   its lange  
she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated  injecting martha  poorly written though she may be  with a little empathy to level out the psychoplaying field  
when she delves into marthas dark side  predictable cliches  chainsmoking  staring in mirrors  praying in a confessional to a priest who isnt there  poking a hole in helens diaphragm so shell become pregnant  and she does   abound  but its moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch  
veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jacksons wheelchairbound paternal grandmother  
the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable  especially paltrow  
but can you really blame them  
the character relationships in  hush  hold a certain amount of promise  at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity  
idiotic situations  martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over  compliment idiotic dialogue   why did you yell   
helen yells back at martha   and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blankfromhell flicks ever made  
you can see through a great deal of marthas actions and lies from their conception  why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out  
does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town  
if any of her potential victims thought  acted or behaved like normal people   hush  would be a really short movie  
and then theres the climax and ending  which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a laborinducing drug normally used on horses  
after a really weird chase scene  martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself  
i wont spoil what happens next except to say that its contradictory  illogical and  probably  since im no doctor  medically impossible  
the final scene offers no closure  no resolution  no confrontation whatsoever  
its just there  dangling amidst silent displeasure  
no one should like this ending  regardless of their feelings on the preceding material  
perhaps  hush  s title is a plea to silence its audiences likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater
