i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard  
the problem is  i cant remember them as i write this review  
thats not a good sign  
in booty call  jamie foxx is bunz  a character whom i cant really describe  because i dont know that much about him  
i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk  and that he doesnt like relationships  just  booty calls  at three in the morning  no questions  no commitment   
bunz has a best friend named rushon  tommy davidson   who seems to be bunzs direct opposite  on the straight and narrow  and currently in a longterm commitment  a whole seven weeks  wow    
rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend  nikki  tamala jones   but for a reason which is not totally explained  its going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikkis friend lysterine  vivica a  fox   who have never met  
to make a long story short  the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikkis obsession with safe sex  
first she wants condoms  so bunz and rushon go out and get them  
oh  no  they have to be latex  not lambskin  
back to the store  
now theyve got to get dental dams  or therell be no foreplay  
why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand  
nikki phones lysterine  who lives across the hall  and tells her shed better be making these demands  too  
talk about coitus interruptus  
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies  
the difference between the two is that in the latter  things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  
in this category  for example  you have ace ventura  private eye on the mild side  and airplane  
at the extreme  
there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status  but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  
it is disappointing  and even worse  distracting  
there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker  are those real names   
does not live up to its potential  as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing  
for instance  there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant  
bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese  much to everyones surprise  
however  when asked how he learned the language  he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films  and soon gained mastery  
this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene  
if  on the other hand  when asked how he learned to speak chinese  bunz simply replied with   kungfu movies   and then moved on  the joke would have been much more effective  
this is because it would have been totally unbelievable  but funny because we know it is unbelievable  
by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible  the film is not giving its viewers enough credit  
the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions  
why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends  
why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine  
if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex  why doesnt she have some condoms at her own apartment  
these questions are not answered by the screenplay  but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward  
a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language  
some movies use a lot of swear words  but use them under very justifiable circumstances  as when they are employed consistent with a characters pattern of speech  
other films  such as the recent jackie brown  use them in ways that almost parody themselves  
booty call just sticks them in to get laughs  and it doesnt work  
they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them  
half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason  
the chinese restaurant  a holdup at a convenience store  and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story  and are in there for filler  
this is surprising  considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long  
its too bad that the core of the film isnt much better  since it is comprised of sometimes funny  but forgettable dialog  
i refer you to the first paragraph of this review
