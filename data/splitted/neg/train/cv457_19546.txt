lauded as a genius by many  stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such criticallyacclaimed films as    a space odyssey    a clockwork orange    lolita   and  dr  
strangelove  or  how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb   
now  sadly  hes added  eyes wide shut  to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his nearflawless copybook  
kubrick  alas  should have quit while he was ahead  
this muchpublicized psychosexual teaseathon  with its star billing of reallife marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman  is nothing more than one long  twoandahalf hours long  boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut  
kubrick  faithless to arthur schnitzlers  novella  dream story   has confused eroticism with nudity  
he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly  
he has confused profundity with pretentiousness  
in addition  the director has made some strange casting choices  leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out  
pollack  the director of such boxoffice hits as  tootsie  and  out of africa   is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here hes miserably out of his depth    
and there isnt much depth to begin with  
unhappily  theres not likely to be a directors cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one  
in fact  with the exception of the stark blackandwhite credits  snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack  and many  many grainy tracking shots down lavishlydecorated corridors  theres none of kubricks trademark brilliance in this film  
it doesnt help that the story  as delivered  is ridiculous  
cruise and kidman  who bring little more than marital torpor to the project  play welltodo new yorkers bill and alice harford  
hes a doctor and shes an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address  
at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler  pollack   alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy ironslike hungarian  whos singularly determined to get her in the sack  
bill  too  is seen arminarm with a couple of models before hes pulled away to deal with an overdoser  
back home  bill and alice smoke a little pot before alices aggressive jealousy kicks in  
as retribution  she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed  
this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin  he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with blackandwhite images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman  
its all way too much for him  
for revenge  bill almost has sex with a hooker  
he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store  
then he almost does the hookers roommate  
and hes almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious  passwordprotected party where everyone wears masks and  the women are incredible   i  e   naked   
this  erotic  set piece  a cultish bacchanal complete with chanting  incense  and lots of strategicallyplaced partygoers covering up the dirty  might impress the likes of hugh hefner  but its a lot less shocking than its intended to be  
whats the big deal  
bill doesnt exactly  do  anything  other than throw his money and credentials around   and alice only ever lusted in her heart  
whoopdeedoo  
still  they make up at the same agonizingly slow pacewas kubrick  notorious for multiple takes  paying them at an hourly rate  
even geniuses have their bad days  
  eyes wide shut  just happens to be kubricks bad day  an unerotic  disappointing  and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career
