by starring in amy heckerlings  clueless  two summers ago  alicia silverstone proved she wasnt just another pretty  pouty ingenue  showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs  namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of  the crush   out of the water  
her only work since that  gem has been in junes  batman  robin   where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl  
now  shes the star and producer of  excess baggage   a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an illcomposed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level  
silverstones emily t  hope is stuck with a billionaire father  jack thompson  who neglects her emotionally  
in an outlandish plan to gain his affection  she fakes her own kidnapping  emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom  ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw  
but before the police can  rescue  her  professional auto thief vincent roche  benicio del toro  jimmies the locks  hotwires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily  whos still trapped in the back  
when vincent discovers emily  the two dont exactly hit it off  she annoys him  he annoys her  and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner  harry connick  jr    he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there  
along the way  of course  they get into a whole heap of trouble  and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky  felonystudded situation  
it doesnt help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops  crooks and even her shady uncle ray  christopher walken   whos wise to his nieces ploys for attention and has mafia connections  
for at least a halfhour   excess baggage  bounces along fast and efficiently  
during this time  emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice rolereversal twist  shes an awfully aggressive  combative victim and hes quite the aloof  seemingly vulnerable captor  
but once its past its setup  the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once  
a road movie  a teen comedy  a mob thriller  a drama about family relationships  you name the cliche and  excess baggage  likely covers its territory  
of course a romance develops between the two leads  but it all seems forced  and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome  
  do you like my tummy   
emily coos to vincent at one point in the film  
huh  
did i miss something  
the hardedged  foulmouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting googoo eyes  
then again   excess baggage  becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise  
a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles  but the movie isnt game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded  
motivations keep shifting  resulting in an often confusing narrative  
scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions  
  excess baggage  has too many characters  too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand  
i loved silverstones turn in  clueless  as an aloof  pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austens  emma   
looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there  its simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for  excess baggage   
sadly  however   excess baggage  is no  clueless   
but  on the other hand  it is clueless
