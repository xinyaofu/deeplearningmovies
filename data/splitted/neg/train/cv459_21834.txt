     because im a scientist  
thats what we do   
 dr  alexander mccabe  bob gunton   in response to why he created evil bats  
alright folks  stop me if youve heard this one  genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals  assisted by a specialist in the particular animals field  must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth  
oh yeah  the military is on their way to bomb the town as well  so they are running short on time  
sound familiar  
such is the plot of the destination films release of bats  
dina meyer stars as the  bat specialist  sheila  who is pulled from her research  along with her annoying sidekick  played with irritating deftness by leon  in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently  
with the help of the local sheriff  lou diamond phillips   a cdc official  carlos jacott   and a scientist  bob gunton   sheila discovers it is indeed bats  who have been genetically altered by guntons character to be more aggressive and omnivorous  in order to be used as a military weapon    
i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  
theres not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  
in this respect  the film never disappointed me  
this film reaches a level that transcends the  so bad its good  level and borders on the downright insane  
the effects are awful  the script is contrived  and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously  i think   
i challenge anyone to sit through the scene  where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner  with a straight face  
thankfully  the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with  
dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in  johnny mnemonic  dragonheart  and starship troopers    
the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit   and this one is no exception  
while one never really gets the impression that meyers character could be a bat expert in reality  one never really cares to doubt it either  
she gives as good a performance as could be expected  plus shes nice to look at for an hour and a half  
lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here  as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero  
although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for whats going on in town  for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats  
the only bad performance in the film is that of leons  
he is relegated to the  im not sticking around here   
character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays  
anyone who cant immediately tell that bob gunton  the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films  is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised  but i highly doubt it  
even if he hadnt been the villain in just about every film hes ever been in  so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever  
in fact  his death is welcome  because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale  
if the plot doesnt sound ridiculous to you yet  then check out these little tidbits  a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol  
an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctors orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated  causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force  killing several townsfolk  
a government official blows off shelias instructions  to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off  by pulling a night job  resulting in the death of an entire military unit  
a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it  
finally  to top it all off  this little texas town is showing nosferatu in its single screen theater  for reference  our town has over a million people in it with nearly  movie screens  and were lucky to even get kevin smiths dogma   
the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the illconceived bat puppets  
while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing  making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend whats going on   the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more lowkey  
therefore we the audience get loving closeups of the most unrealistic  rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film  
being able to see the puppeteers arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse  
after all of this  if you still decide bats might be the movie for you  dont say you havent been warned  
trust me when i say that its a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through  
i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in  
shes definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these
