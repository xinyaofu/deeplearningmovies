the word to describe sharon stone is  wonder   
not that she is a wonder  but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent  
she has a dynamic screen presence in  basic instinct   turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in  casino   but possesses neither of those here  
stone teams up with private school headmasters wife isabelle adjani to kill adjanis thoroughly unlikable husband  chazz palminteri   
in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock  as in homage to read  steal from     it turns out that someone saw them or hes not dead or maybe    
kathy bates turns in a credible  if unspectacular  performance as an investigative police detective  
her character is a bit dull but realistic  although her actions at the end are puzzling  
adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation  
its stone that is a disappointment among the actors  
how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one  
costumed in skintight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone  she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring  not enticingly dangerous  
even the threat  or promise   of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out  
on the positive side  there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive  
that is if you can put up with stones cardboard cutout character and scenes directly lifted from hitchs movies
