the tagline on random hearts reads  in a perfect world  they never would have met   
in a perfect world  i never would have seen this movie  
the biggest flaw is that  minutes into this film  kay chandler  kristin scott thomas  and dutch van den broeck  harrison ford  are the only two major characters alive  resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production  
dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department  
kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire  
although they both think they are happily married  their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs  
dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners  they subsequently discover the affair  
the rest of the film is the pointless  unrealistic and oftentimes boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to  and getting to know each other in the process  
two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film  
dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer  a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare  
all the great stereotypes get pulled  including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter  
kays distraction from the films primary focus is her campaign for reelection and attempts to shield her  year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal  
these sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points  but the film seems afraid to explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth  and consequently suffers  
random hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells  
although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots  they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other  
there is plenty of opportunity  dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter  but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships  
veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack  and critically acclaimed upandcomer dylan baker both have cameo roles  but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both  
other than its weak plot  it is hard to criticize random hearts  
however  it is also hard to compliment it  
had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake  rather than the dry one that equates to be
