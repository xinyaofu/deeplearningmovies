the movie starts with a rather seenish opening sequence  rather cool and sets the mood for things to come  
the story propels the audience into a neoreality  somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red  
existenz is actually the name of a new virtualreality game  
supposedly  vr games are highly popular as is considered a legaldrug in this neoreality  
      leigh  is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate gameexperience in the form of existenz  
players are required to have bioports embedded in their spine  which plugs to a gamepod in order to enjoy the immersive experience  
during a secretive betatestingcumteaser meeting for this new game  an assassination attempt on    life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard     law   
    is more of a realists than anything else  afraid that hell lose reality if he begin to play these games but    requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt  
as they soon discover  they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected  
existenz has all the cronenberggore that is expected of him  
even so  this film is nowhere near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners  
not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly  
existenz can probably be looked upon as his s version of videodrome  even so  it is a poor followup  
while in most of his famed films  his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot  
in existenz  the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of overindulgence than anything else  
jennifer jason leigh and jude law  both commendable actors  looked aloof and missdirected throughout the entire film  
the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the bgrade category  
it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tightbudget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film  the opening sequence  though  probably formed a considerable portion of the budget   
which is actually quite good  
existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times  
 years ago  it would have been another classic for cronenberg  
cronenberg fans however   those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film  should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you
