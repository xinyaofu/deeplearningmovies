there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom  surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strongworded attack on a group of stoic doctors  
when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way  i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture  
you see  patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries  
i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it  and i actively hate it now  days later  with the simpering  superficial  nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories  
i hate every element of the film  beginning with tom shadyacs shameless direction  and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  
the badness of patch adams is stupefying  
its confounding  
i cant believe a film can be this bad  
and yet  its based on a real man who probably has a good point to make  
in the film  patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams  in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human  
in the beginning of the film  patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesnt want to kill himself  
while there  he notices that the doctors dont care about the patients  and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings  
so  patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients  
he goes to medical school  where he meets truman  daniel london  and convinces him that its good to help people  
he also meets carin fischer  monica potters   the antimale med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor  
naturally  the dean of the medical school  bob gunton  hates patch  and wants to thwart his plans  even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams  
so patch decides that hes going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  
and that  my friends  is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of   
on a superficial level  the film is not particularly bad  i wouldnt say the cinematography bothered me  and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for  i actually liked potters performance  even if she is wasted   
but the film fails fundamentally in execution  
every scene swells with grand   emotional  music  played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard  
take  for instance  the first scene  which shows patch sitting on a bus  
we dont know patch yet  but theres sad music  and its supposed to make us really sad that hes sad  
later on  patch makes a lot of progress  he helps a dying patient  peter coyote  to enjoy the last days of his life  and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively  
and when that patient finally dies  spoiler alert    the music is very very sad  
but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions  
real drama is characterbased  
you grow to like someone  and then something bad happens  and you feel it  
we dont ever grow to know the dying patient  hes simply a vehicle for patchs greatness  
real drama doesnt seem forced  or present just to make the audience cry  
thats why patch adams is not real drama  
it goes for every cheap tear imaginable  wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene  
even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaimans sickening musical score  
sentimentality like this is indeed bad  
but its not as bad as halfbaked  simplistic themes  
you see  patch is a really great student  
he aces his tests without studying  and does it so effectively that people think hes cheating  
but patch doesnt think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor  
  why dont we see patients until the third year   he bursts out every three seconds  
well  patch  that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients  
not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort  
most of us have to study  
and a doctor who really wants to help  but doesnt know a toe from a finger  probably wont be too successful in preventing death  
oh wait  i almost forgot  the point of doctors is not just to  prevent death   but to  improve the quality of life   
yes  
that is true  
and you can not do that without studying  
you can not do that without going to medical school  
what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe  just maybe  it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later  
follow the rules  
bah  
who needs the rules  
only uptight doctors follow the rules  
the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants  
and then theres the free clinic issue  which i find shockingly  frighteningly idealistic  
a free clinic  
in the middle of the forest  
where patients can be taken to be helped  
for free  
how will patients be transported to the free clinic  
will it have an emergency room  
or is it just for mental patients  
and who  may i ask  will pay for it  
the film does give some token attempts to question patchs motives  i think another character asks him how hes going to pay for it  in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance   but they certainly dont explore or challenge patchs ideas to any meaningful extent  
reader  please understand this  i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams  
i know nothing about him  
if his beliefs mirror those of this film character  then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them  
but regardless of what the real patch adams believes  the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony  
and in the last scene  the big  obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus  patch does a lot of shouting  
actually  robin williams does a lot of shouting  
he shouts a lot about helping people  and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words  
i wont tell you that you cant be moved by his words  because i  too  was moved by his words  
i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be  
patch adams is the cheapest of them all
