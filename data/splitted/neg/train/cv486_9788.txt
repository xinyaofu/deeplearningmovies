where do i begin  
okay  how about with this  starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time  
in fact  it might even be the worst  major  release film to come out in years    
or even a decade  
this is bad beyond belief  
i would  not  suggest paying money to see this  
theres a good chance youll regret it  
if you see it for free  you could still want to walk out  
go right ahead  
the movie starts off with cheesy  scenes set in the future world of    buenos aires  
here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious  easyto  despise  withapassion characters that have love triangles  love rectangles  and love hexagons screwing up their life  
before long they all go off and join the military  primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined  
they train  
they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever  
after an hour of making the audience scream in agony  they start fighting bugs  
the big bugs look nice  even though their design is only  okay   
unfortunately  the fights are boring since we  want  all of the characters dead anyway  
cue more agony  
then some characters have sex  
then some more die  
    who cares       
cue more agony  
the movie ends  the audience runs out to their cars  vomits over the pavement  and attempts to drive home  
unfortunately  after that torture  they cant think straight  dont pay attention to the road  and many are in ugly car wrecks  
you remember how batman  robin was bad  
well  batman  robin kicked this movies sorry butt  people  
starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie  
it does not succeed as a drama  
it does not succeed as a war movie  
it does not succeed as a comedy  
it does not succeed as a satire  
it does not succeed as a parody  
it succeeds as being horrible  
terrible  
gutwrenchingly bad  
i wanted to run away from that movie every minute  
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better  
so i stayed  
it never got better  
frequently  it did the impossible  and got  worse   
the movie as written  acted  directed  and basically just feels as a whole like its about on the mental maturity level of a free willy   the whole thing feels like a movie that only threeyearolds could enjoy    
except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore  and pointless nudity  
its written for little children  but children should definitely  not  go anywhere near it  
of course  i recommend the same for everyone  
dont go anywhere near it  
verhoevens got a streak going now  
his last movie was showgirls  
he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming  
showgirls was a failure  but it appears that  though itll be lucky to make near its budget  this movie will still do okay grosswise  
is it really  all  bad  
well  no  
troopers has about four or five lines of dialougeshort humorous scenes that are actually funny  mostly from the  do you want to know more   
commercials that pop up throughout the story  promoting the joys of the joining the troopers  
so that adds up to about  seconds of entertainment and still about one hour   minutes  and  seconds of miserable torture  
im totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie  
but i do admit it  
so  if youre willing to possibly put yourself through torture  go ahead and see it  and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it  
i dont know how anyone or any  thing  could love this movie  but hey  to each his own  
feel free to give it a shot  
of course  in the interest of saving your souls  i dont recommend it  
but guess what  
alien resurrection comes out november th  and  having already seen some of it and having read the script  i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away  
though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split  itll be difficult to find someone that  wont  like alien resurrection when theyve seen it  
this is possibly the years best intense action film  or at least  one  of the best  
if you really want to see alien warfare thats played out intelligently and seriously  see alien resurrection  
please  avoid this
