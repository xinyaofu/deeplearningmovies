the u  s  army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done  
one particular field manual is known as the fm   which among other things  covers the practice of saluting  
under the  saluting  section is a subsection which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer  
the salute is rendered by the highestranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail  and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail  
in any event  the salute is rendered only by the man  or woman  in charge  rather than by the whole group  
almost at the very beginning of the generals daughter  we see a generals motorcade passing a work detail  
everyone salutes  
it looked impressive  but it just wasnt right  
that little bit showed me that someone either didnt do the appropriate research  or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene  
in fact  this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture  as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie  
what results is a film that looks good  but like that one scene  just isnt right  
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example  
paul brenner  john travolta  is an agent for the armys criminal investigation division  undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale  
prior to the transaction  the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isnt the unscrupulous supply sergeant hes supposed to be  and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living  
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark  well just say that it involves propellers   
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding generals daughter  captain elisabeth campbell  leslie stefanson   is found naked  bound  and dead on one of the bases training ranges  
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill  madeleine stowe  to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder  
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary  
it gives no insight into brenner  other than the fact that hes a little cocky  
does the arms subplot turn up later  
no  so why add this extra running time to the film  
the answer  it looked cool  
or how about the  atmosphere   
the beginning of the generals daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south  thick trees  dirt roads  sultry colors over water  all backed up with bayouesque music  
nice immersion in the setting  but it soon doesnt matter  for when the films plot shifts over to the murder investigation  so does the entire mood  
no attention is paid to the location of the story  and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme  
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie  
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film  we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another  just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside  
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie  
as ive already mentioned  an entire section of the film doesnt jibe with the rest  and the characterization only adds to the difficulty  
brenner  who comes across as a man with little respect for authority  suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell  james cromwell  and utters some of the corniest  yes  sir  s ive ever heard  
he even delivers an emotioncharged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the generals daughter  even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous  
sunhill  who initially comes across as a professional investigator  utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information  and even revels in her ingenuity  
both characters are protagonists  but its hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place  and in some cases  simply unappealing  
i could imagine that during filming  west would shoot a scene  then take the actors aside and tell them   lets do it again  but this time  i want more   
i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good  in this film they overact in most of their scenes  
an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the generals aide  colonel fowler  
i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention  
a far cry from his days as linc in  the mod squad   i cant help but think he was acting from wests direction  
a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist  john beasly  and a young female private  ariyan a  johnson  make their scenes nearly impossible to bear  
the only two actors who seem to have escaped wests influence are james woods  who provides a good performance as colonel moore  elisabeths mentor at the psychological operations unit  and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police  
woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with peoples minds  and does so without ever taking it over the top  
hutton just kind of hangs around  but at least he wasnt overacting  
i havent read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based  but ill bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form  
the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space  or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished  
every time were presented with some new aspect to the case  west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like its the most momentous discovery ever  but the information is not used by the investigators at all  
instead  when conclusions are drawn  they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts  but lucky guesses instead  
the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill  letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects  then letting them guess who the killer was  
wouldve been over in a half hour  
the film finishes with a sort of bookend  featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning  
literally during the closing credits  we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off  then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off  
they both seem kind of happy  
maybe they were driving away from simon west
