i dont appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting  when in fact its ludicrous  
in the case of the generals daughter  the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point  
but at this juncture in the story  the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie  
this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving  and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of its detailed flaws  
get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent  and youre likely to survive this entire movie  
travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner  whos working undercover at a military base when another situation arises  the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer  leslie stefanson   
it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell  james cromwell   
let the investigation begin  
with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill  played rather onthesidelines by madeleine stowe   brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case  
things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore  james woods   a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve  
woods submits another scenestealing performance here as he oozes authority  surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar  
with echoes of his supporting role in true crime  in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges  he makes every moment believable  
here though  the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta  as the two send mindful  knowing glares across the room  
there are many scenes such as this in the generals daughter  in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure  but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb  
director simon west  con air   shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller  but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it  
the generals daughter is  more often than not  a predictable and unexciting mess  
it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless  dragging its heels all the way at a mindnumbing snails pace  
a few brief action scenes  marvelously handled in the editing department  show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package  
from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts  i suggest west should stick with mindless  riproaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this  
still  the movie is certainly not without its merits  
the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast  
the performances range from commanding  travolta  to electric  woods  to stiffasaboard  cromwell  who doesnt show off his real talents here   
madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while  but as the female lead in an actionthriller  she doesnt pull through sufficiently  
one of the problems with the execution is that its very predictable  
from minute one  i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question  
the script even unwillingly points him out for us  using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end  
in all fairness  weve seen many of the devices used in the generals daughter put to greater effect in other films  
the secrets behind the girls mysterious death are explained gradually  but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly  
the generals daughter is not a terrible movie  and it is involving enough to sustain a viewers attention span for a certain period of time  
but it just could have been so much better
