at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong  
but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers  thinking the performance was planned  and applauding it for their efforts  
thats  dirty work  in a nutshell  
a very different kind of movie  
this is not a movie that i can easily review  
the critic in me analyzes the structure  plot  acting  characters  
  
  and 
tells me this movie is terrible  
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing  
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie  
its a one note concept  
mitch and sam need  in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients  
realizing they are very good at revenge plots  they open a revenge for hire business  eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald  who after roles in  happy gilmore  and  veronicas closet  seems typcast in this role   who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriends grandmother  thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house  
first the critic in me  
the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device  where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way  
heres the catch  
none of the characters are sympathetic  
theyre all selfish jerks who dont care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want  
the jokes are juvenile  crude  appealing to the worst elements in people  
theres jokes about prostitutes  the homeless  beastiality  anal sex  
theres even a subplot thats developed  it seems  only to make jokes about infidelity and incest  
and i loved watching it  
i was a huge fan of norm macdonalds sarcastic  tothepoint comedy on saturday night live  and this movie is an hour and a half of it  
norm macdonald takes a joke  strips it to the core  and tells it like it is with a dry wit  
like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job  
the foreman goes over the basics  which mitch and sam dont understand  
how do they get out of it  
by admiting they lied on their resumes  and dont know a thing about construction  
and surprise  they get fired  
the characters are incredibly meanspirited  
theres a father whos loud and obnoxious  a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his fathers condition by saying  if i were a gambling man id put a lot of money on death   
the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky  and does who knows what with it  
and then theres mitch and sam  who  thinking they can get  by destroying a building  ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents  
  too bad we have to do it   mitch says  
heres a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up  where you see every punchline coming  where every spot profanity could be used and then is used  
at least the film is honest  and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic  
but at least it isnt dull  and it isnt predictable  
and thats the way it should be  
its sketch comedy  and if youre a fan of norm macdonald  youll love it  
the jokes are crude  the characters are mean to the core  the attitude of the movie is that it just doesnt care  
if you dont like norm macdonald  or stupid movies  then you probably wont like this one  
the jokes are crude  the characters are mean to the core  the attitude of the movie is that it just doesnt care  
so before seeing this one  tune your mindset  and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor  gay animal sex  prison rape jokes  uncaring characters  and one last performance from chris farley  
the critic in me says    but i give it an        
i just couldnt stop laughing
