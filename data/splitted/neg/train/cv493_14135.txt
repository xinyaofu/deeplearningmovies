to sum the entire film    up in one sentence  it would be  watch a vh documentary instead  
     seems like someone brought william faulkner into   brought him into studio   got him really drunk  told him to write about it  and then dumbed that down to be released to the public  
a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex  drugs  and disco  
the narrator  shane oshae  ryan phillippe   works as a grease monkey in new jersey who  of course  on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio     
phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young  attractive actor with a six pack stomach  
he is let in by steve rubbell  mike myers   the infamous coowner of studio   because he is attractive  
he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender  
  
  
you expected more  didnt you  
there isnt  
the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as its climax  isnt that an apt word for studio   lands with a thud  
the glitz of the club and perpetually semiclothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the its glamour  
for much of its target audience  college age to early thirties  it attempts to show celebrities mixing with  normal people   
this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote  
you can be sure that half of the audience hasnt heard of them  another quarter only know their names  and the other quarter knew they were there already  
the humor  if you can call it that  is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then 
the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high  sexually ambivlaent  very new york steve rubell  
he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive  
he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued  almost nostalgic performance  when needed  
it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on  coffee talk  sans dress and wig  
the supporting cast of salma hayek  breckin meyer  and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere  
the romance between phillippe and cambell  as a soap opera star  is completely implausable  
the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes  
hayeks wannabe singer seems extremely forced and her husband  greg  meyer  stands in as shane oshaes surrogate best friend  
the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long  
overall     tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine  
the film never leads to anything  has no obserable point  and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people  
in truth  that reminded me of the eighies
