you know  i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man  
while watching instinct  i couldnt help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the wellexplored themes of those earlier movies  
even beside the tarzan comparison  instinct just isnt a very good film  
its painfully idealistic  manipulative  and silly  
i didnt hate it  its simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins  furthermore  most of the acting is quite good  
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved  
i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct  and its pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams  
things start off in the predictable way  as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero  theo caulder  cuba gooding  jr    an ambitious  young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced  old psychiatrist  donald sutherland   
caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life  the one he thinks will make him famous  
the subject is ethan powell  hopkins   an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years  
powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa  and its now caulders job to find out of hes mentally competent enough to stand trial  
through a series of short sessions  caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell  
even though it really is an old man version of tarzan  much of this central idea is rather interesting  
as i said  hopkins is captivating for every second hes on screen  he has a way of convincing us that hes not acting  that hes actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas  
the character himself isnt very interesting  hes just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas  but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action  
gooding jr  does strong work opposite hopkins  playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual  
the screenplay  written by gerald di pego and  suggested by  a novel by daniel quinn  gives us no background information on caulder  but that seems to be the point  he has no time for friends because hes obsessed with his work   
nonetheless  these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct  
unfortunately  filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting  
turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instincts artistic failure  for they work together to make the dumbest  most clicheridden environment in which their characters are to live  and they do so by means of brainless subplots  
first  we have the prison warden subplot  
the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulders progress at any cost  if this means taking caulder off the powell case  then thats fine  
theres also the prison guard subplot  
the prison guard is played by john ashton  the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision  and hes instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion  
then theres the daughter subplot  in which maura tierney  playing the daughter  must look very upset a lot of the time  after all  she is the daughter of a deranged man  
if some of this stuff sounds familiar  thats because theyre all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films  
the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here  
the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoos nest had  
ashtons evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy browns in the shawshank redemption  
hopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs  
and then theres the whole tarzan thing  which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film  
perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth  
the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one  he thinks that humans are  takers   that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas  
i can sympathize with that  but only when its in a compelling film  
this is the kind of stupid movie  just like patch adams  in which a big group of characters  psychotic inmates  in this case  rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards  
what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas  
if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor  we would have had a thirtyminute movie far superior to the twohour one that i watched today  
if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise  then we would really have had something interesting  a movie that doesnt rely on the strength of its actors
