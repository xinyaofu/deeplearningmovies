in the finale of disneys  mighty joe young   a foot tall  pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground  
upon impact  rugged everyman and perennial dogooder bill paxton rushes in  containing the emotional crowd with an earnest  move along now folks  theres nothing to see here   
ok  so those arent exactly the words he uses  but its probably one of the few clich  s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies   king kong   
s  mighty joe young  was an update of that classic creature feature  also based on merian c  coopers original story   years after  kong  it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable   
now some  years later  at least according to disneys way of thinking  the world is ready for one more  
not so  
the onlyand i mean onlyreason to see the  version is for the special effects  
and these  unfortunately  run hot and cold  
todays joe young is designed and produced by specialeffects whiz rick baker  who has been wowing audiences with his stateoftheart makeup effects since s  schlock   which  incidentally  featured a bakerenhanced  gorilla    
joe is a combination of animatronic effects  computer graphics  and that old standard  a man in a monkey suit  
while there are occasional flashes of brilliancebakers had a lot of practice with simian effects  after all  including  gorillas in the mist    greystoke  the legend of tarzan  lord of the apes   and the  remake of  king kong  theres also some surprising cheesiness  
one of the films most embarrassing moments is when paxtons band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the largerthanlife primate  in a scene unashamedly ripped off from  the lost world  jurassic park    
paxton jubilantly extols the beasts majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe  and the computer effects driving him  stutter to a halt  
also  if the films producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldnt have paraded female lead charlize theron   trial  error   around in a seeminglyendless wardrobe of spaghettistrapped tops  
even joe seems distracted at times  
the film piles on the clich  s like theres no tomorrow  including the predictable plot  anthrozoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l  a  where urban havoc is inevitably wrought   predictable villain  a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace   predictable love story  bill and charlizesurprise    and predictable denouement   twas boxoffice receipts that killed the beast    
kids raised on  men in black   nonmonkey effects also by baker  are going to find ron   tremors   underwoods outing a little lame by comparison  
while certainly better than s  king kong lives   itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake    mighty joe young  proves how the mighty keep falling
