an attempt at florida film noir  palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels  
its slow moving  uninvolving  and plain just uninteresting  
harry barber  woody harrelson  is an exnewspaper man  just out of jail after being framed for a crime  
his luck hasnt been the best  but things are looking up when a mysterious woman  rhea malroux  elisabeth shue   approaches him with a proposition  
she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter  odette  chloe sevigny   pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get    out of her stingy  but rich  husband felix  rolf hoppe   
at first  all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone  and to collect the money  of which he gets to keep    
but  as the deed is carried out  things are not what they seem  and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm  
palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film  but the effect never quite comes together  
its got the sultry florida heat  seductive women  and even curvier plot twists  but the whole thing smells of paintbynumbers  
sure  the right ingredients are there  but the end result is much too artificial  
a lot of the problems lie with the script  which  though providing some genuine surprises  is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations  
even the plot twists dont seem to flow well with the rest of the story  
some of them  for example  come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist  for example  harrys spontaneous job offer  or the whole typewriter situation   
the characters are mostly lifeless  played to type  but not much more  
woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thickheadedness that its hard to even picture him as an exjournalist  
elisabeth shue vamps it up  but doesnt add anything special to the role  
chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance  trying to be a sexy year old  but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth  
some of the supporting cast  notably gina gershon and michael rapaport  give stronger  but  in the end  meaningless performances  
and to top it off  the pacing of the film is much too slow  
as the movie grinds to a halt  youre given too much time to wonder why youre wasting it watching palmetto  
if youre in the mood for this type of movie  youd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir
