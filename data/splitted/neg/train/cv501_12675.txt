comments  the ex is a very bad movie  
i havent seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while  
i kept vacillating  however  between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor  ultimately  i decided to split the difference and give it two stars   
as summarized briefly in the synopsis  this is yet another spurnedpsycholovergetsherrevenge type movie  
im not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline  but it seems like         
the ex  however  though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre  differs slightly from the norm in that  at least  it doesnt take itself too seriously like so many other duds do  malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind   
those involved in the movie realize theyre in a turkey  apparently  and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script  
the exs storyline  as i said  incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature  however  the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that  after a while  the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie  
diedre  davids first wife  kills and kills and kills  for example  without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like  its not as though shes bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime   
david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael  their son  has emotional problems  specifically his inability to control his anger  
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie  the connection between him and his son is not made  
molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing shes a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son  
time and time again  things do not add up in this movie  
if a viewer cant accept this fact  then he will definately not like the ex  
if  on the other hand  he can appreciate the movie for its campiness  then hell probably like it much better  
i dont mean to necessarily suggest  however  that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp  
even when viewed from an itssobaditsgood angle  this movie isnt all that successful  
the ex does have its moments  though  almost all of which involve yancy butler  the psychotic diedre  and nick mancuso  david   
these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which  oftentimes  elicit chuckles from the audience  
the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along  
butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue  every time her character kills someone  she has a punchline thats unbelievably inane  
when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david  for example  diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states  im so sorry  your lease is terminated   
or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene  
  diedres therapist wishes to have her recommitted  so she decides to visit diedre  alone  in her new apartment  never realizing  of course  that its not hers  
therapists typically are catatonically braindead in these movies   
having successfully snuffed the woman out  diedre looks at the body and says   what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session  dr  jones  
oh  thats right  
im sorry  but your time is up    
this is what passes for humor in the film  
the audience doesnt necessarily laugh but groan  the type of groan that suggests the audience cant believe theyre watching this crap  although watching it they are   
nick mancusos chainsmoking  nervouswreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butlers character delivers  but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief  
in between drags off his cigarette  for instance  in one of the movies best scenes  david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his exwife is  
in exaggerated exasperation  he nearly shouts  the woman is a cuckoobird   
  trust me  it is funny in context   
and so  the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion  
i wont reveal the ending specifically  though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review   but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film  
molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds  
molly  at one point in the film  notsobrilliantly observes  after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her familys to spy upon them  that  shes crazy   
youd be pretty crazy too if youd rented this turkey  
id avoid it unless its on tv and you come across it  
if you do  you may want to watch it  groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot  and feel good that you didnt spend money renting it
