michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels  many of which are science fiction  
the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel  
so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a bigbudget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel  
congo failed  and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better  
it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good  
the film is expensive  over one hundred million dollars  is long   minutes  has a terrific cast  including dustin hoffman  samuel l  jackson  and sharon stone  but has little that is really original and less that is exciting  
several years ago dr  norman goodman  played by dustin hoffman  was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered  
the plan he wrote was only semiserious  but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien  
now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes  peter coyote  to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early s  
suddenly normans less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft  
included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams  samuel l  jackson   biologist beth halperin  sharon stone   and astrophysicist ted fielding  liev schreiber   
together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets  
one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of goldtoned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship  
what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances  
director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects  
the problem here is he is making a bigbudget science fiction film  
it has some effects  but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen  
the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewers imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting  
that could be a reasonable approach in a lowbudget film  
but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster  
it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put  they dont  
hoffmans acting seems muted  
jackson seems to laid back  
we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads  
levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance  
and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybodys guess  a 
cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price  
look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors  
most science fiction spectaculars these days have secondtier actors and firsttier special effects  
levinson tries secondtier effects  and firsttier actors  but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer  
perhaps scifi spectaculars are just not an actors medium  
the result gets a  on the  to  scale and  on the  to  scale
