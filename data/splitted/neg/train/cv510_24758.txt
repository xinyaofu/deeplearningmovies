well lets see    im 
not quite sure how to review this film  based on its laughter factor  
well yeah i can  its not funny  
ok so i laughed one time which warranted the  star  but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over   which at a running time of  minutes seemed like forever    
in fact  this could be the unfunniest movie ive seen in a long time  if not the unfunniest  
let me be the first to say  ready to rumble  is a huge disappointment  
long time wrestling lovers  david and scott  dream of making it to the wcw  and watching jimmy king wrestle  
that is their hero of course  whom is kicked out of the wcw  
well here is where the plot thickens  lol   the two wish to rescue the king  and put him back into the wcw but not that easily  because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them  while davids father wants him to become a police officer  and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots  
what a plot eh  
  ready to rumble  is one of those films that tries to be funny  but sadly fails miserably  everything in the film is imcomprehinsable  and even the trailer wasnt funny  
the actors are dull  the script awful  and the plot which there isnt much of     really 
annoying  
im not quite sure how great actors like these  and very funny actors too  are given such a lame script  and directed in such a childish manner  that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days  
this review isnt going to be very long because of the fact that there isnt much going for the film  if anything at all  
only one big laugh is in the film  which isnt all that hilarious  
i sat in my chair wondering with this         
minute  comedy  was going to be over  and sadly it went on forever  
im not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste  but believe me you  it is
