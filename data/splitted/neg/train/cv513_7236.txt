capsule  silly and inane adaptation of gibsons short story  which is nowhere in sight  
gibsons script only adds insult to injury  
johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie  
i say  awesomely  because its one thing to fail  but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged  
keanur reeves  who is terrible  stars as johnny  an  information courier  who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head  
he is given  one last job   whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words  run   which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal  
one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories  but its only followed up on in a token fashion  
for his trouble  johnny gets chased by the yakuza  who seem to be the new bad guys in all the hightech thrillers  
whats funny is that if you watch gangster movies made  in  japan  there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics  but of course theres no room in this movie for any of that  
the yakuza are simply used to point guns  wave swords  flaunt tattoos  and grimace menacingly  
  i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies  bound by honor  sugar hill and american me come to mind  when asians remain perpetually stereotyped  
but thats another essay   
anyway  johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark  
why newark  
maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york  thats why  
there  he meets an assortment of odd characters  icet  dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos   
the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture  
it turns out  what else   that the data in johnnys head could save a lot of people  but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesnt kill him  
handled right  this could have been absorbing  but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity  
the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other  better movies  blade runner and brazil come to mind  
everything looks rundown and scummy  everyone dresses like theyre punk rockers  and videophones are commonplace  
snore  
the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future  complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves   but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively untechnical fellow would  think  it would look and behave like  
a hacker of johnnys caliber would be blasting away with one commandline function after another  instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms  but of course thats not cinematic  
whatever  
what went wrong with this movie  
gibson wrote his own screenplay  which i guess is part of the problem  what works as a short story doesnt work in a movie  
his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesnt advance  it convulses  
from the script on out  it was probably all downhill  
renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless  theres no fun in kicking a wounded dog  is there
