what are the warning signs of a  terrible  movie  
making its debut at the dollar theater  
locally  chairman of the board did just that  
having the annoying prop comic scott thompson  better known as carrot top  in the lead role  
chairman of the board  once again  
how about an overly exhausted  paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence  
did somebody say chairman of the board  
thats right  carrot tops long dreaded major motion picture debut  at least for a starring role  is poking up in a handful of theaters across the country  
chairman of the board stars the obnoxious  wannabezany king of redheaded standup comics as a lazy but creative  inventive but uneventful generation x er named edison  
living with a pair of surfer dudes in a small  rented house  edison bounces from job to job  always squandering away the money on his eccentric  to say the least  inventions and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent  
this has the crabby landlady  ms  krubavitch  estelle harris  best known as george constanzas mother on  seinfeld    threatening an eviction if past due expenses arent furnished post haste  
as luck would have it  edison soon meets armand mcmillan  jack warden   an old surfer dude who just so happens to be president of the multimillion dollar mcmillan industries  
sharing a passion for more than just riding waves  armand is deeply impacted by the young inventors notebook of dreams and ideas  and when the old man dies soon afterward  edison learns he is named a benefactor in armands will  
predictably  edison acquires the entire corporation and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowledge of the business world  
predictably  there is a bitter nephew  larry miller  whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot  
predictably  there is an attractive employee  courtney thornesmith  whose initial repulsion will transform into love for our doofy protagonist  
predictably  the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds and give the company its most profitable and successful turnaround ever  all because he ran things by common sense and not greed  
its as though writers turi meyer  al septien  and alex zamm  meyer and septien also wrote leprechaun  together   
pulled a plot out of a hat and worked carrot top into it  
the jokes  the  surprises   the developments  all of them run such a predictable path  it may only be carrot tops signature brazen red hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films  
a movie this bad speaks for itself  
whats left to say when every element the movie possesses is a shameful retread of movies past  
the script is  recycled  the direction is hokey  and the acting is absolutely horrible  
it is only thornesmith who seems to take her job seriously  an accomplishment which surely deserves the medal of honor  
she certainly went beyond the call of duty  she has to kiss carrot top       
  barf bag  please   
movies like this give the audience nothing to do but ponder just how many synonyms for  bad  there really are  
chairman of the board  without a doubt  deserves each and every one  
the only way this wont end up on everybodys  bottom ten of the year  list  is if they were lucky enough never to have seen it  
just because you cant miss his outlandish fiery mane  dont skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature
