you dont look at a ren  magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning  
you likewise dont look at one for  minutes straight  
surrealist works are notable for their quirks  and they are fun  but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting  
that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died  a surrealistic  hyperactive comedy with no dialogue  
its not a silent movie  there is lots of atmospheric music  occasional screams and weird sound effects  but nobody ever utters an audible word  
though the film is distinctive  its unique style wore thin after about  minutes  and as it progressed  watching became a chore  
the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudolegendary ed wood  the man behind such  classics  as plan  from outer space and night of the ghouls  
the joke  of course  is that his films are so bad  theyre good  so humorous in their inanity that they become hits  
i woke up early the day i died  unfortunatly  is so bad that its really bad  
it stars billy zane  titanic  as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse  escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around  stealing a car  clothes  and a load of money  
our thief reaches a cemetery  where he witnesses a bizarre ritual  
he falls asleep and finds himself  literally  in a hole  with his money gone  
for whatever reason  he is bent on getting his hardunearned cash back  considering how easily he stole it the first time  why didnt he just go steal some more    
he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they dont have what he is looking for  
i dont think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious  minute short  
the subject and the style seem to have been made for it  
unfortunately  twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length  and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome  
it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on  up to the point where halfway through i was already weary  
it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious  but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is  
i woke up early the day i died is a comedy  i guess  though it could have fooled me  
unlike most ed wood films  this one tries to be funny and fails  instead of the other way around  
theres nothing inherently wrong with that  in fact  i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so  good  at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one  
whether wood actually went for comedy in his script well never know  but in either case  this is a failure  
jonathan taylor thomas  christina ricci  summer phoenix  john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos  
ricci  for example  plays a prostitute  
her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out  
thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff  
was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work  
zane  meanwhile  occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up  
lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature  
the carnival sideshow climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this nobudget production  
its desperately unfunny  but thinks its the funniest thing since plan    its so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction  
i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting sendoff
