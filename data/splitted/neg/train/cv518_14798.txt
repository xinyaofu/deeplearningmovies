well  as i check my score card for what ive done this holiday weekend  it reads good ideas   and dumb ideas    
i dont know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie  
but in my defense  i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him  
the film that im talking about is a night at the roxbury   one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit  
wayne and garth  these two are not  
rather  we meet doug and steve butabi  the actors names are not worth mentioning   two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city  the roxbury  
driving in their dads bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice  they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club  
have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt   they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change  
their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pickup lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl  let me see that label  
just as i thought  made in heaven   says one of the brothers   
and  like the losers that they are  they fail to do either for much of the film  
however  as fate would have it  an accidental meeting with whateverhappenedto richard grieco gives them the allimportant ticket to get in  
their sad lives take on a whole new direction  
they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene  
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women  
but their newfound popularity does not impress their father  who has other plans for them  
the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a onejoke movie  and the brothers are the joke  
actually  theres about  mintues worth of tolerable stuff  
alas  too long for tv and way too short for a featurelength film  
thus  there just isnt enough material to sustain the minute movie  
theres no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaways europop song  what is love  
i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash  
to take up more film time  there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug  
this creates not only friction between the brothers  but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well  
shes educated and a forebearing witch  
meanwhile  doug is a complete loser  
how did these two ever get together  
i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question  ill have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie  
if youre looking for entertainment  you wont find it at the roxbury
