i cried during babe  
i admit it  
the special effects  the story  the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a  childrens film  so much so that  yes  i got a little overly sentimental  
such  my friend  is the power of cinema  
when word came out that they were using this newly developed fx for a doctor dolittle update  in which eddie murphy plays the title character  and many great comic actors supply the voices  my anticipation rose to great expectations  
they cant possibly drop the ball on this one  
cant miss  
cant possibly miss  
they missed  
what went wrong  
after much thought  i supply three general rules  
    dont let a television actressturnedcomedy movie director near an urbanite script  i  e   penny marshalls dreadful  preachers wife    
betty thomas worked wonders with  the brady bunch movie   but the same sitcomairiness doesnt quite work here  
its as if she lifted a generic sitcom  and iced it with light doses of modern rb  
take away the black cast  take away the atrocious soundtrack  and you have the residue of some mids kirk cameron show  
    the greater the cast  the less the individual castmember has to do  i  e   
  con air    
it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman  garry schandling  john leguizimo  ellen degeneres  and gilbert godfried in your lineup  but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped  stereotyped characters  onelineatatime  
its even worse  because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you dont get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits  
now there are three character actors who do get special treatment  albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project hes in  and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy  
norm mcdonald fares nearly as well  as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle  
but theres little humor here  
that rests on the shoulders of chris rock  sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wiseass guinea pig  
even the mouth is illsynched  
    dont let the special effects technicians walk away with the script  
theres a certain timing thats mandatory in comedy  
to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim hensons creature shop  is a travesty  
this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies arent welltimed laughfests  with the right director  they can be and have  
here  betty thomas is clearly over her head  
i wish i could commend the special effects  but theyre merely average  
count the number of times where the animals mouth is turned away from the camera  or too far to notice  or illsynched  
this is less a  babe  and more of a  look whos barking  clone  
you may be wondering  how does eddie murphy fare   
well  he came back with the exceptional  nutty professor   and i dont doubt he can come back again  
here  hes tied into a straight man and given little to do  
the exceptions are when he fears hes going crazy  a far cry from his smarterthanyoud expect routine that hes more adept at  
its unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago  making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years  
after all this  whats left  
butt jokes  
a lot of butt jokes  
i guess for kids that may be funny  but i was stonefaced  
if theres a lesson the film may be telling us  is that animals have feelings too  and they care way too much for your butt
