heres a rarity  a childrens film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject  is there a god  
done well  it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern childrens cinema  
unfortunately  it isnt  
with jumbled messages  and an unclear audience  wide awake was better left asleep  
fifth grader joshua beal  joseph cross  is in the middle of a moral crisis  
his beloved grandfather  robert loggia  has died  and joshua has begun a quest  
he wants to find god  to discover why bad things happen  
this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents  dana delany and denis leary   but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths  
at his catholic school  his favorite teacher  sister terry  rosie odonnell   tries to give him guidance  but this is a journey he must make on his own  
meanwhile  he is having the most momentous year of his life  
he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave  timothy reifsnyder   he gets his first crush  and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey  
it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be  
on its surface  it appears to be a kids film  
however  it deals with serious issues  and is likely to be boring for todays instantgratification kids  
and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience  wide awake asks serious questions  but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer  
if there were a bit more meat in the story  adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie  
the actors who might have created a great cast  odonnell  leary and delany  are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos  
the nostalgic elements  best friend  favorite teacher  first crush  etc   have been done much better in other movies  and actually seem more like filler here  
the films strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshuas relationship with his grandfather  
they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie  
maybe the film would have been better if  instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks  it were set entirely during joshuas last year with his grandpa  
it certainly would have been more entertaining  
wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment  
it starts out with noble aspirations  but never delivers on its promise  
parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions    that is if their kids arent bored to death first
