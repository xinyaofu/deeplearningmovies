this is crap  but  honestly  what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker ing expresidents  
especially when their supporting players in clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief  lauren bacall as a former first lady  and john heard as the dan quayleish vice president  
yup  youre talkin presold property here and  for warner brothers  the perfect fit into their nowritual grumpy old men holiday slot  
for the nondiscriminating viewer  my fellow americans is fine  
the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political thriller roadcomedy  
  they did in mine  heaven help us   
for the rest of us  the movie is immediately tiresome  
the tone is terrible and the banter is worse  
forget wit lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie  
  has anyone counted the number of first penis references   
sure  some of the bits are absurdly funny  including a mens room macarena joke  the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels  and an all dorothy marching band performing  over the rainbow  at a gay mens march  
the get there from here  though  you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time  
judas priest  is there a single moment of silence in this film  
even the dialogue gets drowned out  
what a waste
