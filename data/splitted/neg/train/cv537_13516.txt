fantastically over hyped  godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen  
the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands  then an attack on a boat from some beast  and finally we join dr  nick tatopoulos  broderick looking about  years old  doing some research in chernobyl  
some shady u  s government guys appear  and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints  from what looks like a giant lizard  
and whats more  this beast is heading for new york  
gulp  
although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride  and at some points it is  there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie  
the main faults lie with the acting and writing  common problems with summer blockbuster movies  
broderick is pretty useless as the hero  with no humour or a tough guy image  
while emmerichs previous summer flick  independence day    had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith  this has neither  
also  maria pitillo  as brodericks former girlfriend  is just as useless  with a chronic disability in acting  
shes incapable of showing emotion  speaks every line in the same way  and basically shes total crap  
its up to french actor jean reno to save the day  and indeed he does  turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent  
shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film  
hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named animal  and he adds a little life to the picture  
also making an appearance is harry shearer  probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons  as a slimy news reporter  
o  k  so the acting is not up to par  but it never is in these movies  
but what about the script  
well  thats not up to par either  
emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script  
the dialogue is banal  broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters thats a lot of fish     and the character development is non existent  reno plays the typical frenchman  no croissant     
broderick forever remains a geeky scientist   
also  the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour  
the jokes that are uttered are pathetic  and theres an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert  
  the mayor is mayor ebert  and is assistant is called gene  
ha ha ha ha    
the plot is dire  and in the end just rips off jurassic park    by having lots of baby godzillas  i  e  
velicorapters  running around new york  
right  so the script and acting suck  
but what about the special effects  
thankfully  theyre are quite good  
godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi  although we dont see much of him because the movie is so dark  
the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell  
but although they are impressive  they cant save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie  
the movie goes on for far too long aswell  and it cant seem to decide on a ending  
and of course  the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel  
lets just hope one never arrives
