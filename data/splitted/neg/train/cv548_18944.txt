the generals daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film well see this year  or perhaps the stupidest clever film  
its confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction  
that  however  is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller  
the punchedup punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the generals daughter has a brain in its head  even as the remaining  of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense  
our hero is warrant officer paul brenner  a brash investigator for the u  s  armys criminal investigation division  
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell  leslie stefanson  at a georgia base  the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation  
complicating the case is the fact that capt  campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell  james cromwell   a war hero and potential vicepresidential nominee  
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press  which gives brenner only the  hours before the fbi steps in  
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill  madeleine stowe   who  coincidentally enough  once had a romantic relationship with brenner  brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captains past that make the case ever more sordid  
if only the sordidness were the worst of the generals daughters problems  
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary  their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filteredlight sleaze  
director simon west likely thinks hes covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers  but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches  which is the films fatal flaw  
its a trend he continues for two hours  taking the storys few virtues and slapping a coat of moronproof obviousness over them  
characters who may  wink wink  turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow  cutaway inserts of the captain campbells stillliving face after the corpse is uncovered insure against fiveminute attention spans  
west just cant help himself from overdirecting every minute of the generals daughter  
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slowfade edits  
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell  
the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbells mentor  a psychological warfare expert named moore  james woods   
theres something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another  
indeed  travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures  to the local sheriff of the georgia county   shouldnt you be out nightsticking the colored folk     
even the lame device of brenner and sunhills sexual history provides a few winning zingers  
goldmans dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than youll find in most socalled comedies  
dialogue  unfortunately  just isnt enough to make a quality script  
its difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner  an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene  and too lucky for it to last any longer  not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye   
by the time the generals daughter wanders towards its overwrought  psychointherain finale  wests heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun  
its silly and pretentious filmmaking  but at least it provides a giggle or five  
goldman should tear the  decent pages out of this script and turn them into a standup routine
