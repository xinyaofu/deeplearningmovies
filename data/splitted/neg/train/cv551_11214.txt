kate  jennifer aniston  is having some problems  
it appears the twentyeight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder  and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related  as the owner of her advertising agency  mr  mercer  kevin dunn   explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company  taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick  jay mohr   a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kates boss  darcy  illeana douglas   uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea  but after getting immediate positive results  she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc   
at a dinner with kates bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kates new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy  sam  kevin bacon   who wouldnt give kate the time of day  now does  
now that she is engaged  he pursues an affair with her  as doing so would destroy her good girl image  hence sams sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate  as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her  and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige  but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick  but  reconciliation  will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother  olympia dukakis   who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is  from the waist up  only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
its like the director said well  we know the story is formulaic and the performances arent that great so  what the heck  lets show jennifers assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating   
quite frankly its insulting  
i dont think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns  shes the one  because it was a smaller and supporting role  and she just doesnt deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately  as far as romantic comedies go  this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to  my best friends wedding  in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions  gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didnt care for how quickly kate puts down nicks profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasnt glamorous enough for her coworkers  
at least  my best friends wedding  changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with  picture perfect   
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away  including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company  why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first  let alone consider a relationship  
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick  
throw in the fact that i dont think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him  but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away  
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple  
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers  
well  i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars  then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron
