  have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming   
obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment  and so to finish us utterly  they have now released  urban legends  final cut   
this is another  scream  like feature  consisting merely from the recycled materials of ripoffs from the most pointless movies of all time  
amy  jennifer morrison  is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do  
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious universitys film program  where each years best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize  a virtual oneway ticket to hollywood success  she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese  loretta devine   whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines  
soon enough  fake  and real  blood starts to flow  and amy is being chased around by scary killer  while her cast and crew get slain  one by one  
is the culprit the original urban legends murderer  just some random psycho   
a member of the faculty  one of her competitors for the hitchcock  or is there something even more stupid going on  
this is another one of those tiring  pointless teen slasher flicks  neither scary  funny  or interesting  
it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain  
the body counts and screams continue to grow  as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly  
in fact watching films like that after having watched  scary movie  is impossible keeping a serious face  
several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing  without succeeding  
and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing  
its the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century  
how many times must we tolerate the same clich  s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth  
it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them  
they are the most stupid  meaningless  predictable and soulless films in existence  
however  director john ottman manages to make  urban legends  final cut  into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre  
what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in  scream   ottman takes seriously  
for that reason alone  it is worth a look  just to realize how bad a movie can be  
its tough to find comparisons for such an achievement  and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect  
even movies like  lost in space  and  mission to mars  seem spectacular in its shadow  
we have not seen such waste of t  
ime and resources since  showgirls      
no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production  i came up with nothing  except the way the killer was dressed  
here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and mariesylvie deveu  that have wisely replaced the well known screammask with a very elegant fencing mask  
jennifer morrison   stir of echoes   is all right  and the other actors best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script  
in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film  with the exception of its screenplay  is its portray of film schools  
if these graduates will be the directors of the future  then hollywoods golden days are over  
rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment  
lets just hope and pray that its just an urban legend
