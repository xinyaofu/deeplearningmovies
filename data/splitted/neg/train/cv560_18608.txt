i love movies  
i really do  
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas    or raiders of the lost ark     a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent  skill and entertainment that is on display  
even lower grade films such as the naked gun      or ghostbusters ii    while not exactly brilliantly well made  are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value  
then theres my favourite martian  the exact opposite of what a movie should be  a hurried  poorly written and acted movie with one goal  to make money  
disney  ever since the lion king    have lost their magic touch  but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk  
christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t  v reporters tim ohara car  daniels   and soon tim finds the martian in his home  trying to recover and fix his spaceship  
along with his zoot spacesuit  voiced by wayne knight  must fix his spaceship before it explodes  and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public  firstly by ohara  but later by rival t  v presenter brace channing  hurley   by calling himself tims uncle martin   
laughter is supposed to arise from the comical events  but never does  
many bad films have good intentions  but my favourite martian doesnt appear to try to provide any entertainment  
filled to the brim with wham bang special effects  my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy  
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie  ive never seen a man pull a face for  minutes until now  
jeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless  
his performance is incredibly lazy  although his paperthin character doesnt deserve more than the performance he gives  
darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever  but her role is somewhat  erm  limited  
hurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like a twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating  godawful performance in a moving picture   
way to go liz  
for the supporting cast  disney manage to assemble every character actor out there  during the film i was going he was the guy in    ah   er     
before finally giving up and switching off  
another major setback is the staple comedy sidekick   
unfortunately  the writers  sherri stoner and deanna oliver  if anyone cares  forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be funny   
instead  they deliver zoot  the martians deeply unfunny sidekick  
although meant to be a manic character no doubt  every line that comes out of his neck is a dud  
a real dud  
citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester  
even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character  not one child even bothered to smirk  
its a nice special effect  though  
another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves  
or rather  the lack of them  
my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour  it goes past the bowl  down the pipe and into the sewer  
now  toilet humour can be funny  as dumb and dumber    humorously showed  
but here  characters farting  belching and almost getting crapped on  literally  is not amusing   
its insulting  
theres one good gag right before the credits  but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued  
either that  or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldnt mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes  
yes  men at work  
yowza  
the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film  and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more  
there are thousands of brilliant films out there that cant get distribution  yet trash like this gets released nationwide with ease  
thankfully  as soon as it makes its money  it will never be seen again  and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie  down the toilet
