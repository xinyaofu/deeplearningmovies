i looked at the  internet movie database  s awards section for this film  and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for  best picture  drama    
anyone whos seen this film can back me up on this  this is the worst of the  great  disaster films  and thats not really saying a lot for this film  
  earthquake  is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured  
on video  its a bland and slowmoving film which gives us a bunch of different characters  the disaster film requisite   then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster  
while this worked in  say   the towering inferno   it doesnt here for one single reason  we dont care about any of the characters  
the film gives us charlton heston  in one of many crap s films he made  including  skyjacked  and that classic   soylent green   as a rich man married to ava gardner  who is having a little affair with a young single mom  genieveve bujold   a renegade police officer on suspension  george kennedy  in his least humored performance   in the second weirdest subplot  a motorcycle stuntman  richard roundtree  right after his  shaft  thing  whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down  yea  snore   and the weirdest subplot  a military manbag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal  and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair       
in smaller subplots  theres a pointless bit about people who are flying over l  a   the city in the film  by the way   one whos playing cards and married to a boring nonacting husband  you think this one can go nowhere  
guess again  he gets interested in the final frames   theres genieveve bujolds moron son  who has a little adventure with wires  and for some muchneeded comedy  theres walter matthau  billed as walter mutha     
 the only laugh in the film   as a wild drunkard  whos big moment is a dance he does at a critical time  
as for the actual  earthquake   its rather a letdown  
theres a full hour of charactersetups  none of which is interesting  then about  minutes of shaking  crumbling  and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold  narrowly missing   
this film needed that whole theatreshaking  they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored  
theres little suspense following the quake  although this film tries for it  
theres an adventure in a crumbling highrise office building  the wires with the kid  and the movement of people who are all injured  
but none of these are alltoo suspenseful  
the finale with the hestongardnerbujold love triangle is ended in a basic flipofthecoin bit  which brings out a big letdown  
and theres no real finale  
even  volcano  ended nicely  and that movie really sucked  
not only is it hokey  but you dont care about any character  
who cares if heston dies  
who cares if he choses bujold or gardner  although i would have chosen gardner  mainly on the basis that she can actually act   
who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid  stunt   
who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires  
and who cares about that whole plane spiel  
if anything   earthquake  is worth a viewing for the same reason  glen or glenda   
is  
i mean  i laughed at this more than i did at  bio dome   
but thats another story  and review   
in short   earthquake  gives disaster pics a bad name
