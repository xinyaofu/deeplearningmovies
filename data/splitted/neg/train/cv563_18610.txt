the thirteenth floor is a bland  obligatory exercise in genre filmmaking  
if i hadnt recently watched the matrix and open your eyes  both of which are similar but far superior  i might have been a little nicer to this picture  
craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall  the rich cocreator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss  armin muellerstahl   
everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one  and characters stare at each other for maddeninglylong periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level  
the acting is okay  but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of  and features a script  copenned by director josef rusnak  loaded with cliches and stock characters  
there are individual scenes and ideas that work  i like the thought of a sentient computer program  but none of the films strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree  
producer roland emmerich  based on this and his previous directorial efforts  seems hellbent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre sciencefiction
