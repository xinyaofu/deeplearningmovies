alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oftplayed character of dashing swordsman dartagnon in director peter hyams adventure  the musketeer   
for some reason that i may figure out later  i dont know why the time  money and effort were put into the making of  the musketeer   
it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this films xinxin xiong   once upon a time in china   and yuen wooping from  crouching tiger  hidden dragon   
the result is a mix of genres that dont mesh well  
elements of the ritz brothersstyle comedy  for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the   the three musketeers    the man with no name from  a fistful of dollars   dartagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western  and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano  
the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the  matrix  crowd  
alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters  
the real problem with the  the musketeer  lies in the casting of the two lead  romantically intertwined characters  dartagnan and francesca  mena suvari   
chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character  a la chris odonnell  but lacks any onscreen charisma  
suvari has the doeeyed  pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen  but she  too  does not have the chemistry to command the screen  
if  the musketeer  makes them any money  they should invest in acting lessons  
stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one  
the supporting cast is  on the surface  impressive  
catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty  dignity and humor  especially when she plays off of dartagnans mentor  planchet  jeanpierre castaldi  who reminds of andre the giant in  the princess bride   
stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu  but is given very little to help flesh out his character  
tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinals chief henchman  febre  
he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout  
the rest of the players  particularly the three musketeers aramis  nick moran   lock  stock and two smoking barrels    porthos  steve spiers  and athos  jan gregor kremp   are background fodder whose role is to come to dartagnans aid when needed  
peter hyams does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well  
a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps  
photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions  dartagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them singlehanded  he fights a gang of febres henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen  with the obligatory branches hanging over the road   he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy  febre  who murdered dartagnans folks years before  
it is all routine stuff  
the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap  defying gravity  up walls and from horse to horse  
it works in a scifi film like  the matrix  or in a classical fantasy like  crouching tiger  hidden dragon  but just calls attention to itself in  the musketeer   
at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used  
it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed  
with a run time of  minutes it should have been more like  and i give it a d
