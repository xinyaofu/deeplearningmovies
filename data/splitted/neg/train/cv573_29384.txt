synopsis  original  jurassic park  survivor alan grant  neill  is tricked by paul and amanda kirby  macy and leoni  into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur  to rescue their stranded son  
grants team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar  and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought  
review  there is one reason why  jurassic park iii  is better than its immediate predecessor   the lost world  jurassic park   
the latter wasted  minutes of my life  the former  only   
the first  park  was a marvellous film  full of aweinspiring sights  interesting characters  and genuine thrills  
its two successors have been pale imitations  amounting to hundredmilliondollar bgrade horror movies  
at least this third entry realises it  whereas  the lost world  tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot   jurassic park iii  simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin  
there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie  the computeranimated dinos are no longer novel or exciting  and even the firsttime presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation  
remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie  
nothing in this rehash even comes close  
add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman  payne and taylor  and phonedin performances by the normally capable macy and leoni  and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts  
at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character  and there is much less gore than in  the lost world   making this installment more suitable for children
