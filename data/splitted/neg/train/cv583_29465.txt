susan grangers review of  two can play that game   screen gems  
since the success of  waiting to exhale   there have been several romantic comedies about africanamerican professionals  
this female revenge fantasy  vivica a  fox plays shante smith  a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success  a mansion  a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky  hotshot lawyer  morris chestnut  
shes at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girlfriends  monique  wendy racquel robinson  tamala jones   
  when your man messes up  no matter how small it is   she smugly decrees   yuh gots to punish him   
so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival  gabrielle union  she devises her own version of  the rules   a day  tough love  emotionally punishing plan to get him back  
unfortunately  writerdirector mark brown   how to be a player   breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy  you have to like the protagonist  and shrill  selfcongratulatory shante smith is a smirking  superficial  spiteful shrew who doesnt realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love  
having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the  day one    day two  titlecard device underscores the tedium  
comic anthony anderson scores as chestnuts boisterous bestfriend  and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic whos given a smooth makeover by ms  robinson  
but the outtakes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    two can play that game  is smarmy if slick   filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements  cocacola  miller genuine draft  but little else  
in this rrated  for explicit sexual language   pseudohip battle of the sexes  the audience loses
