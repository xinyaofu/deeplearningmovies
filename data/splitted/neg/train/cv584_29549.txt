susan grangers review of  glitter   th centuryfox  
theres less here than meets the eye  
or  put it this way  if you thought madonna was awful in  shanghai surprise   mariah careys worse in this reworking of  a star is born   
she plays billie frank who  despite being abandoned by her singeralcoholic mother  valerie pettiford   believes shes destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is  
  youve got this amazing gift  and you gotta use it   her roommate says  
  your voice  its incredible   says another singer  
  i aint never met anyone like you   proclaims julian  dice  black  max beesley   the hot new york dj who becomes her svengalilike producerlover  
problem is  her signature song   i didnt mean to turn you on  is wretched  
and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to  exploit  her by having her wear a bikini  the audience bursts into laughter  
exploit mariah carey  who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow  
come on  
writer kate laniers script is fatuous and director vondie curtishall doesnt have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and  as a result of their incompetence  whisperyvoiced ms  carey seems to be embarrassed onscreen  
she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a closeup  pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes  
talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept  and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline  theres an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view  
perhaps one of the reasons ms  carey suffered her highlypublicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    glitter  is a pathetic   
right now  its tops on my list of the worst of
