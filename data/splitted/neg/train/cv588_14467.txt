perhaps if the impostors didnt have so much going for it  it wouldnt have been such a tremendous disappointment  
written  directed  and produced by one of its two stars  stanley tucci  whose last picture was the indie smash hit  big night  the impostors almost never catches fire  
sputtering like a twoday old campfire  the story plays like an adlib sketch that was never polished or completed  
the films other star  oliver platt  was hilarious as the senators aide in bulworth  
the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent  including woody allen  steve buscemi  hope davis  alfred molina  campbell scott  lili taylor and tony shalhoub  
all are wasted save allen  who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes  
  the audience will easily identify with allens sentiments   
with the exception of a single original joke involving mirrorimaged subtitles  the movie engenders little genuine laughter  
the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it  
the plot for the movie involves two starving actors  maurice  oliver platt  and arthur  stanley tucci   who accidentally end up on a cruise ship  
in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor  alfred molina   who is chasing them  they dress up as ships stewards  
the overthetop script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer  
when the leads hide from their pursuers  arthur covers maurices mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze  
at other times  we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else  while darting in and out of staterooms  
with the films chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage  it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce  
the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having  
too bad they werent more concerned with the audiences potential enjoyment  
the jokes  frequently framed in silence  fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground  
one wonders if anyone ever viewed the films dailies  
surely  if they had  they would have realized what leaden results they were producing  
it is tricky having good actors play bad ones  but  if they couldnt pull it off  they should have just given up  
  the show is over for this fella   steve buscemis character says towards the end  
the mystery is why they didnt all give up in the beginning  
there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast  
the impostors runs     
it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around  and up
