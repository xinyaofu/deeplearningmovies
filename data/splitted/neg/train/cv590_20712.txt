if youre debating whether or not to see breakfastofchampions  ask yourself one simple question  do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie  
the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolphs chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the crosssection of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight  
everyone elseand im hoping thats most peoplewould be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess  
actually  though  the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle  which focuses dwayne hoover  bruce willis   the owner of dwayne hoovers exit  motor village in midland city  
not only is he a huge success as a businessman  hes also something of a celebrity  his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials  
with a nice home and family to boot  dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happyyet hes not  
his wife celia  barbara hershey  is perpetually in a pillinduced haze  his son george  lukas haas  is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name  bunny   
not only that  the environmental protection agency is on dwaynes ass over a building development project  
its enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdownthat is  if he doesnt succeed in blowing his brains out first  
meanwhile  midland city is about to host a fine arts festival  and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout  albert finney   a writer who is far from the renowned author the festivals organizer  buck henry  was led to believein fact  hes a penniless hack who writes secondrate scifi that appears in porn magazines  
his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey  one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne  who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of lifes answers  
the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews  but  ironically  i have barely scratched the surface  
i havent yet mentioned wayne hoobler  omar epps   an excon with an obsessive admiration for the similarlynamed dwayne  
then theres the matter of francine  glenne headly   dwaynes devoted secretary  
not to mention dwaynes employee and old friend harry lesabre  nolte   the one with the secret penchant for crossdressing  
and so on  
the film is essentially dwaynes story  but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is  
rudolph does arrive at a point  more on that later   but its blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material  
the surreal visual style  complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwaynes ears  is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness  but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad  
the actors are called on to act accordingly  resulting in some of the worst  most overdone work all of them have ever turned in  
willis fares best of allbut thats because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience  
with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time  it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious  and rudolph tries to make a statement  
unlike americanbeauty  a film that breakfast resembles in more than a few ways  to its great detriment   there isnt any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift  
as such  the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned  and the film attempts  to no avail  to reach a profundity that it doesnt deserve  
vonneguts original novel is considered a classic  but it had been called unfilmablethe same that was said of hunter s  thompsons fearandloathinginlasvegas  which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam  
with the similar failure of breakfastofchampions  will hollywood ever learn that books labeled  unfilmable  inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable  
likely not
