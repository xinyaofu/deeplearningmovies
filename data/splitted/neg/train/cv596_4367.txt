ive got to admit it    
im a huge jim carrey fan  
i loved the first ace ventura  as well as the mask and dumb and dumberand even in batman forever  which was a pretty awful movie   carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good  
until i saw ace ventura   i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying  
sadly  ace ventura  shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be  
carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie  but this time it is no longer funnyit is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i  
the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon  in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof   
soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and  if not returned in four days  will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other  
once again  its up to ace to save the day  using his uncanny detective skills  
those who have been disappointed by carreys more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him overacting to the best of his ability  but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesnt capture the feel of the original  
the original benefited from what looked to be carreys constant hypedup improv sequences  which were hysterically funny  
here  however  the tighter script  which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies  takes the improvised material from the first  and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie  giving carrey little chance to improvise  
instead  his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly  
but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself  
in the first movie  he was always cool  and one step ahead of every one elseperfect for carreys offthewall approach  
but here  ventura is made to look a lot stupider  and is often made out as the straight guya role which is definitely not carreys style  
there are definitely some very funny moments  but they are few and far between  
they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura  or even dumb and dumber
