for about twenty minutes into mission impossible  director john woo  the killer  hard boiled  face off  appears to have made an exciting  elegant  charming spy thriller  kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american  read  unsophisticated  hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
sadly  as the picture progresses  the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up  twohour long episode of magyuver  
and not a particularly good one at that  
what went wrong  
mi begins flashily enough  that initial flash leading us to believe that itll soon give way to something of a plot  but it only gives way to more flash  then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruises firing gun just so they can die really cool  
early on  during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt  tom cruise  and nyah nordoffhall  thandie newton   woo works some of his trademark magic  
in one hypnotic  though completely inexplicable sequence  the director slows the action down to a languid semistall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and others eyes with come hither sexuality    just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance  coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain  sans scaffolding  then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  
why  
i havent the foggiest  
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  
with mi woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine  the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  
its possible that these  spies  could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off  though of course this is never explored  
the scenes ive described are really only included to titillate  not to give any insight into character  
god forbid  
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic  but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commerciallike visuals  
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy  the opening has much to cherish  
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices  the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage  romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is   
between the frantic dancing  woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa  kind of way  yet it has style and something of soul  and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  
sure its all smoke and mirrors  but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene thats about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez  george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight  
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres  
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously  
cruise grins a little too slyly  
the cruise character  ethan hunt  has been drastically altered since the first film  
here cruise plays him more as a hip  sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part   
hes cool and dashing  which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut  which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film   and blustered his way through magnolia  quite possibly the most overrated performance of the s   
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruises initial  im the man   
charm and more slomo closeups of his preening mug  
mi falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act  which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just wont stop  
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle  the first gun fight in the film   which really should be unheard of in a john woo film  but alas this particular battle couldve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi  of course excepting the  symbolic  pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture   
weve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand  
it isnt done any differently here  
the action is pure hard target  broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind  
hes cool for sure but hes made to be as empty as the movie  
the actor isnt used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks  he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment  be it during a gunfight  before one or after one  
when hes not beaming away  hes staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell  but woos editing seriously undermines the effort  
he fetishizes cruises angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof  
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that hes really austin powers  
in a classic woo action moment  ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pinup boy angel of death  
the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual  one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise  basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does   
the lead bad guy  played by the appropriately british dougray scott  and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken    on motorcycles  
though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment  the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug  only to fly about a hundred feet  still in bear hug position   land on a beach below and begin a manoemano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a  so you thought i was dead      
not to worry  cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat  
what a hero  
you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mis plot  
my reasoning is simple  im not sure of any good it would do  
the film itself has absolutely no concern with story  only with hurtling forth to the next  special  effect  
i wasnt kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi has less plot than the average aerosmith video  
nobody will go to this for the plot  and if they do theyll surely regret it  
as summer movies evolve  or devolve  character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing  
in mi  the plot seemed to be built around brian de palmas  that films director  stylistic flourishes  while in mi the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woos nonstop masturbatory pandemonium  
its irrelevant in every sense  as is character  
all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors
