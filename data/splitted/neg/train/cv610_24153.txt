an year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch  wearing tightfitting leather  as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a pumpbitch  
two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them  
and roughly  people are booted in the crotch  
welcome to ready to rumble  
judging from the fact that pottymouth adam sandler is the reigning boxoffice comedy champion  you realize  albeit while shaking your head  that yes  there is an audience for this sort of thing  
ladies and gentlemen  i weep for society  
mind you  when executed with style and comic ingenuity  jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel  theres something about mary  and a laxativeinduced attack of explosive diarrhea  dumb and dumber  can be extremely funny  
unfortunately  ready to rumble is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers  nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired  
ready to rumble is built around the dedicated fanbase of professional wrestling     
which  in fact  sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy  
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves  and limited to a stampede of asinine  humdrum bathroom humor  basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and bio dome  
gordie boggs  david arquette  and sean dawkins  scott caan  take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics  
by day  they transport raw sewage  
by night  particularly on  nitro monday   they pay homage to their personal hero and savior  jimmy king  oliver platt   the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community  
with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance  gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title firsthand  
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair  joe pantoliano  sporting long hair and cowboy boots  has other plans  
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page  playing himself  pummel the king into the tarp  thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans  
gordie and sean are shocked  rioting madly while arguing this isnt even a payper view event    
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a comeback attempt  
along the way  you can expect a lot of sh jokes as well  
you may find something to like in ready to rumble if a  you are a rasslin aficionado yourself  or b  you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of lowbrow comedies  
i welcome lowbrow humor with open arms  that is  if its fresh and resourceful  
rumble is nothing but a sloppy  frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation  
the first halfhour is the ultimate test of patience  
luckily  the simpleminded events pick up steam  particularly with the wellchoreographed wrestling action  
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in varsity blues  and when in the ring  he does professional work  
but the violence is too excessive  
having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen harts tragic accident just last year  especially with one characters dive during a cage match  
this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of  
outside the wrestling action  the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term  scattershot  while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of  to   with brills extensive vocabulary ranging from diddly to boob and so on  
the final tally  i chuckled a few times  groaned a lot  and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for   
castingwise  ready to rumble is an odd duck  
oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure  
hes perhaps a bit chunky  but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him fatty  which dampens the blow i suppose  
rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader  the nirtoest of the nitro girls   proclaims gordie   but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg  macho man randy savage and sting  among others   
wcw fans are sure to appreciate these  
others    
well  wont  
i found merit in david arquettes bountiful energy as gordie  which brings me to my finishing     
ahhh     
praise for the film  in ready to rumble  i have discovered something even more annoying than arquettes att television commercials  
now theres a low blow for you
