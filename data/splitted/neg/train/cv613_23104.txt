  be gentle   urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in  the whole nine yards   
  i havent made love in five years   
  neither have i   rebuts perry  
  im married   
if jonathan lynns latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliberand it certainly triesthen itd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film  
instead  its failings go much deeper  
first off  who hasnt had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre  
if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a  comedy  which pairs a robert de nirojames caanbruce willis type with a billy crystalhugh grantmatthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in  
whos next  
jack nicholson and martin short  
it certainly doesnt have to be funny  
  the whole nine yards  is not a particularly funny film  but it is borderline offensive  
offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldnt think twice about pushing your motherinlaw off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete  
that might sound like a funny sight gag  but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isnt all that funny to begin with  
when the corpse is placed in a car  doused with gasoline  set ablaze and referred to as  barbecue   it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end  
  the whole nine yards  is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects  
rosanna arquette plays a slutty  chainsmoking french canadian whos married to matthew perrys nonetoosuccessful dentist  
its an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfitsand unflattering situationsinto which arquette is thrust  
then theres natasha henstridge   species  i and ii  who plays the welltodo wife of contract killer bruce willis  
she gets involved with perrys character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finders fee with mob boss yanni gogolack  kevin pollack  transposing his vs with his ws  after willis jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door  
henstridge and perrys characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together  
perry might have the charm but he doesnt have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man  especially in closeup  
most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet  who turns in a sexuallyripe performance as perrys dental assistant with  it transpires  questionable career goals  
peets gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off  
when  my cousin vinny  is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as  clue    greedy   and  sgt  
bilko   you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path  
perrys pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with  and a director who seems to be watching from the wings  their characters run out of gas quickly
