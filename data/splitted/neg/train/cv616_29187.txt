susan grangers review of  session    usa films  
sometimes you just get more than your bargained for    like when bostonbased hazmat elimination  run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant  david caruso  assures a town engineer  paul guilifoyle  that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week  
erected in   deserted and decomposing since   the danvers mental hospital  is one of the most malevolent  locations  ever chosen for a film  
the structure is so massive  with its labyrinth of rubblestrewn corridors  collapsing floors  stagnant pools of water  isolation cells  and ominous surgical chambers where experimental prefrontal lobotomies were performed  that their task seems impossible within that time frame  
and each member of their inexperienced crew  stephan gevedon  brandon sexton iii  and josh lucas  is coping with his own personal demons as  one by one  their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which theyre working  
the films title is derived from salvaged reeltoreel audiorecorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities  
by the time session  occurs so do dreadful disasters  
filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsawmassacretype ghost story but the script lacks structure and isnt particularly scary  
the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing  
on the granger movie gauge of  to    session   is a dark  gloomy   silly me    at 
first  i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs  danvers  the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcocks truly terrifying  rebecca  that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley
