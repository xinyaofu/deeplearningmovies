whats to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornographyie  
the garbage known as  snuff  films  
nothing  right  
whats to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography  
well    nothing  
so  why make it  hollywood  
theres no reason why the average  sane moviegoer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in  mm   from technical to acting  stands out even more when you consider the star  writer  and supporting castall reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again  
like paul schrader  schumacher has his moments  but theyre few and far  far   
between  
basically  this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out  
well  this wouldnt be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
heres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of  mm     
first thingif you dont heed my advice  then understand what youre about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
its not easy to watch  
i didnt know the details of the story beforehand  but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the  ha   plot revolves around tom welles  nicolas cage  as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a  snuff  film in her late husbands safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl  it had to be a young girl  didnt it  schumacher   who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
shes horrified that her husband would have owned such a film  in mm  of course  and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
familyman welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque  murder   
let me backtrack for a moment  
see   snuff  films are pornos with a violent twistpeople are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however  the deaths are often staged and  in those cases  special effects and  good  acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hardtofind movies  
the thought of this  industry  makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review  but ill swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
youd think hes sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him  
he comes across smut clerk max  joaquin phoenix  who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing  welles finds the men who are responsible for making this  and other   snuff  films  
skip ahead  skip ahead  skip ahead    
led by dino velvet  peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance  and startorturer  machine   christopher bauer   they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  
the movie doesnt end there  unfortunately  because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films dobecome a vigilante  
this film doesnt draw you in  
it keeps you about  miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close  
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour  ie  
  seen    but it takes a large measure of restraint  schumacher has none  and a larger amount of talent  schumacher has little   
by those jabs  im not only referring to his stylish destruction of the  batman  franchise  but  a time to kill  was an immensely overrated disappointment  
for a guy who gets so much studio money  his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled  
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter  
writer andrew kevin walker didnt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for s twisted thriller   seen   
director schumacher doesnt have that innate ability to make you watch things you dont really want to see like better directors are capable of doing  
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we dont see is more frightening than what we do  especially when its a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered   
however  gratuitous is joels middle name  
he must think that not flaunting a hardcore act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint  
no  he doesnt go that far  but we see enough unpleasantness  
he doesnt leave much to the imagination  
its manipulating to hurt  or kill  young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante  
the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters  yet schumacher has no subtlety in his  ha ha   
craft  
case in point  a shot of a christian fellowship bus  good  right   
drives away to reveal one of the villains  bad  right    
see    no 
subtlety  
does joel think were stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery  
who do we root for in this mess  
is there anybody out there  
its not all the directors fault  though  
why did the actors sign up for this  
nicolas cage is an oscarwinner  for cryin out loud  
if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money  what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda  
what is cage supposed to be in this moviea whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears  
villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy  
and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash  
he was so solid as a concerned father in  a civil action   
i guess ol nic  pete  and jim were promised a mountain of money    or 
theyre suckers  
or they just dont care  
there are moments  albeit brief ones  where this rises above the wasteland  
catherine keener is good  although too quick to threaten divorce  as mrs  wells  
baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet  
the mother  amy norton  of the girl in the infamous mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter  
this film has an appropriate bluetoned  washedout look like  payback   which was a much better movie   
the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue  but at other times its rough  
during some conversations  closeups and wide shots are not cut very well  making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts arent good and whose timing was a halfsecond off  
such a technical error indeed stands out  
speaking of standing out  dont believe the misleading trailers  
theres not much action here  
occasionally  yes  but not as often as your tv will have you believe  
after seeing  mm   i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again  
is that a positive  
well  if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive  theyve done a swell job here  
itll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chanceunless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved  
but today im not depraved  so i ask  why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it  
im sure that somewhere right now theres some pretty sick crap going on  but that doesnt mean i need to know about it  
yes  mr  walker  your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there  
yes  mr  walker  the proverbial monster doesnt look like we expect him to  
you said all that in   
move on  
this film serves no purpose  
it doesnt entertain  it doesnt teach us anything  it doesnt make a statement beyond the obvious  this stuff is bad  approach  
only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile  
thats not likely to happen  though  so  mm  is indeed a scummy waste of money  
orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film   to movies    to 
good movies   
if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole  
like  snuff  films   mm  should never have been made  
now  excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it  
useless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme  
he used it in  batman forever   in  batman  robin   in  a time to kill   in  falling down   and its rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
