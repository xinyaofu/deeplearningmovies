in the james bond film  diamonds are forever   tiffany case asks  whether he prefers brunettes to redheads  
bonds response is that it doesnt really matter  as long as collars and cuffs match  
well  collars and cuffs dont match in  the real blonde   
what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny  meandering comedy on screen  
the film  supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business  is wafer thin  
it plays like an  ally mcbeal  episode dragged out to the nth degree  replete with a few unnecessary  fantasy  sequences  
writerdirector tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea  
it isnt  
the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary  
matthew modine plays joe  a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent  
hes  with no agent and no credits since hes too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas  
  thats not really acting  he tells his girlfriend of six years  mary  catherine keener   with whom he bickers constantly about sex  
but they need the money  so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video  
but its not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike  played by elizabeth berkley  still trying to jumpstart her career after  showgirls    
this points out how artificial this whole business is  one supposes  
dicillo has referred to  the real blonde  as  offkilter  but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff     
the film  which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere  is remarkably  on  kilter and  with perhaps the single exception of the alwayslikable modine  whos not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks   the entire cast is vague and uninteresting  
catherine keener  whos appeared in dicillos previous three films  including the brilliant  living in oblivion    is at her most annoying in  the real blonde   
look at her closely  she really cant act at all  
her reactions are all wrong  almost always out of sync with her costars  
she reacts too soon  or too late  to lines and situations  
she moves her eyes  or her mouth  far too much  
she frowns  she yells  she babblesshe blows chunks  
maxwell caulfield plays joes actorwaiter buddy bob  the one obsessed with dating a  natural  blonde  
bobs personality  not to mention caulfields acting ability  parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera  passion crest  stiff and uninteresting  
maybe thats the point  
daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title  a soap dish who beds bob both on and offcamera  
hannah looks about fifty in this movie  shes only    
why is that  
almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples  
why is that   
marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer  
kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent  
buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink  
christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer  
and so on  
the best parts of the  the real blonde  are the beginning and the end  brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog  
theres more depth and sincerity in a single closeup of her expressive face than in the entire film  
while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives  the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if its funny
