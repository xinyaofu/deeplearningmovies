 cigarettes takes place on new years eve   
monica  played by martha plimpton is having a huge new years party  
everyone in town is trying to get there  but some are caught up in other things  
this is the basic plot of  cigarettes  
as we meet the characters headed towards the party  we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal  and not interesting at all  
this disappointed me greatly  
the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion  
lucy  played by courtney love  is with kevin  played by paul rudd  
the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship  but starts to blossom into something more than that  
this subplot is extremely boring and dull  and i am getting quite sick of plots like that  
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot  dealing with kevin  
she plays ellie  an exgirlfriend of kevins  
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalos talent  
there was no point to it at all  and it was hardly even in the movie  
when lucy runs into a bartender  played by ben affleck  another subplot is formed  
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monicas party  
at the bar  he runs into two more girls  
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker  but unfortunately  due to the terrible acting of both of them  i dont even remember their characters names  
ben affleck is a good actor  but his character doesnt go anywhere so he doesnt have much screen time to give a good performance  
featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles  and they are part of the reason the film is so bad  
christina ricci plays val  and gaby hoffman plays stephie  
the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost  
they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night  
this subplot was alright  but it was quite annoying with stephies accent  
hoffman did an okay job of acting  but ricci did good  
she was underused  considering she is such a wonderful actress  
another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy  played by goldie hawns daughter  and jack  played by jay mohr  
jack is an actor who doesnt care about the girls he goes out with  he just likes dates for one night  and the next day he doesnt  
kate hudson is a huge klutz  
she gets herself into very funny situations  that are the funniest parts in the entire movie  
they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well  
this subplot could have been used more  mainly due to hudsons performance  
mohr wasnt good  but he wasnt bad  
he was just alright  which i didnt find acceptable  
there is not much to say about the performances in the film  
none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not  
the only performances that i can judge are christina riccis as always good performance  kate hudsons funny role  courtney loves mediocre performance  and paul rudds annoying and overused performance  
i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr  ben affleck  casey affleck  gaby hoffman  dave chapelle  and especially out of janeane garofalo  
the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes  
martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year   
the soundtrack is full of s tunes  ranging from  i want candy  to  tainted love   
the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the s  
during the film  i often found myself asking the questions   is there a reason to this  
is there any moral story  
is there a point  
are any of the events going on in the film necessary  
do i care what lucy and kevin are going through   
the movie is extremely boring  and by the time they reached elevenoclock  one hour before midnight  i could not wait for the movie to be over  
the plot is okay  but the subplots make it terrible  
maybe if the film was about the party  not about the people at the party  it could have been a lot better  
the bottom line  just like a slasher movie  this  s comedy is just one too many
