ill be the first to admit it  
when you mention the book great expectations  i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class  where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch  
yes  its a classic of literature  but it was a rather dry one  shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine  
certainly  the experience wasnt truly that bad  but  to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book   im not going to tell the story the way it happened    ill 
gonna tell it the way i remember it   
anyway  to return from nostalgia lane  and get back to the present  hollywood  in its trendy attempt to modernize the classics  now presents an updated film version of great expectations  
instead of pip  this time the central character is named finn  played as a boy by jeremy kissner  and by ethan hawke as an adult   
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie  or should that be mrs  joe   kim dickens   and her boorish fisherman husband  joe  chris cooper   
the setting is the florida coast during the mids  
finn is a blooming artist  and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish  one of his two favorite subjects   
during one of these escapades  he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal  robert deniro   
borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady  deniros criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity  and favors hiding on the ocean floor  
ok    maybe 
thats an exaggeration  but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the film  
and thats nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finns motorboat  but i digress  
anyway  finn does the convict a good deed  just to show that hes a really swell guy  
and then the plot moves on  
enter miss havisham    or 
ms  dinsmoor here  anne bancroft   
abandoned at the altar some  years ago  ms  dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid  
with bizarre clothing  eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup  anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role  
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character  she does add some humor to the film  
joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner  but the insane ms  dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece  estella  raquel beaudene as a young girl  gwyneth paltrow as an adult   
for no apparent reason  other than to provide the main plot of the film  finn is instantly stricken for the estella  
perhaps its her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person  or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before  
in any case  neither as children nor adults  chemistry simply doesnt exist between the two  and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her  
even when  as an adult  finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor  reacquaints himself with estella  and draws her portrait in the nude  theres nothing  
in fact  there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnears gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets  
at this point  the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character  and couldnt care less about the two characters  
the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow  
she fails to imbue estella  a remote character in the book  with even the vaguest traces of humanity  
theres obviously something wrong when  watching the film  youre more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character  
without a strong estella  finns obsession seems baseless  
you wish he would just stop whining  let estella marry his rival  walter plane  an oddly subdued hank azaria   and just get on with his life  
in fact  the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot  
finns relationship with his brotherinlaw  joe  is interesting  if a bit stereotypical  
whats more fascinating are his interactions with deniro  
although its only a bit part  it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create  
it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film  
some of the shots work  but others are too obviously staged  for example  both of the water fountain scenes  to have any impact  
finns art  actually the creations of italian painter  francesco clemente  is used throughout the film  but it mostly fails to have the intended effect  
we never see why finn would generate this style of art  which is simultaneously crude and insightful  
as a result  it ends up as distant as the rest of the film  
modernizing the classics is currently in vogue  just see william shakespeares romeojuliet   
simply update the action to a modern setting  and apply plenty of modern rock  
but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations  
as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it  youd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film
