kids today  they dont just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr  loving on the ladies  
no  they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department  namely  playing baseball  
through a series of drippy voiceovers  we are informed that theres no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues  where college alsorans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention  
our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham as  where he is hoping for his big break  
its only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a womans thong  dont ask  that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be  that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne  struggling to make a name for himself  that neither his father  fred ward  nor brother  jason gedrick  pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries  and that the local beauty tenley  tenley  
  jessica biel   is so far out of his league that he probably shouldnt even bother    
but of course he makes a play for her  
summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots  the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee  brittany murphy   the alienation felt by ryans nonbaseball playing best friend  gabriel mann   or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles  marc blucas   
worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that s shows wilmer valderrama and beverly dangelo  both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs  robinsonlike substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham  
in fact  virtually all of summer catch feels like its been done better somewhere else  
for starters  the film has a major question of identity  
its definitely not a sports movie  and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance  
the worst part is the amateurish script  cowritten by an arli writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun    chockfull of phony emotion  
by the end  it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart  
dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice  
coach  brian dennehy  just loving the fact that hes got some work on the big screen  is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint  
ryans catcher  matthew lillard  playing himself again  is on hand to tell ryan to  play catch  with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy  
ryans stoner best friend is on hand to give the gogetemtigerwerebehindyou talk  
and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarmingnuzzlyfollowyourdreams counsel  
before long  you start to wonder  is freddy prinze jr  is capable of having a thought of his own  
dont answer that  
the only real joy in the film is found in biels character  and not just because of the skimpy outfits  which are also usually wet  
shes the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role  taking the rebellingagainstdaddy character to at least a passing grade  
when shes on screen  the time flies by  
when shes not  you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long  
for a pg teen romance  despite nearconstant sexual innuendo   one has to ask warner brothers  what were you thinking    
for her part  biel has fallen so far from her th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards  
hollywood is either about to eat her alive    
or vice versa  
either way  good luck  jessica  
as for freddie  if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year  prinzes next  summer catch  is liable to be a venereal disease
