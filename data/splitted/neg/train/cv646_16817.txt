  with all that education  you should know what happiness is   
starring sylvia chang  teresa hu  hsu ming  li lieh  mao hsuehwei  directed by edward yang  written by yang and wu nienchen  cinematography by christopher doyle and chang huikung 
every country has  eventually  its new wave  
france had its nouvelle vague  brazil its cinema novo  china its fifth generation  and on and on  
some waves just take longer than others  before they wash over us  cleansing us with the balm of discovery  
taiwans new wave came in the s  in the work of directors like hou hsiaohsien  wan jen  and edward yang  that day  on the beachyangs first featureis central  
it created a new language for young taiwanese directors  even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering  
later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here  giving taiwan a distinctive international presence  
that day itself is long and frustrating  the document of a nations attempt to find a voice  
it does not lack ambition  
it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan  in the manner of antonioni  elaborating the alienation that the westernized whitecollar middleclass feel as their lives are shaped by oldfashioned rolesdedicated career men  loyal housewivesthat they find unfulfilling  
jiali  sylvia chang  is the focus  but the film brings others into its compassher husband  her brother  friends from her college daysas it charts her discontents  
no one is happy  
jiali married her husband  welei  at a young age  
at the time  her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage  despite his affection for another woman  and so jialis marriage seemed  in comparison  a good one  she chose welei of her own free will  they loved each other  
but it goes wrong  
that day dutifully presents all the clich  s  welei becomes absorbed in his career  indulges in an affair with a coworker  jiali feels restless and trapped  bound by a choice she made while young  but which no longer seems wise  
the film never redeems these clich  s by conveying the feel of authentic experience  the intensity of lived pain  and much of it seems trite and belaboured  
it unfolds  awkwardly  as a series of flashbacks  told during a luncheon in vienna  where jiali meets her brothers old flame  teresa hu   now a concert pianist  whom she has not seen since college  
both women seem rather sad  and resigned to their sadness  
their circumstances  and those of jialis brother and a college friend  suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choicesmarried the wrong man  chosen the wrong career path  etc  but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate  
it is not that jiali married the wrong man  she didnt  
the problem is that she needed to marry at alland that if she did not marry  she would still be just as unhappy  
for a woman in modern taiwan  that day tells us  the cards are stacked  the dice are loaded  she can play the game  but the house always wins  
the films sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan  
seen now  it does not seem provocative  
indeed  its hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy  it may be ambitious  it may be innovative  but it is also terribly  terribly dull  
and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us  yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others  and his use of those methods is fumbling  uncertain  undisciplined  
nor does he bring anything newother than the localeto the material  
there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives forin a young couples first kiss  in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husbands mistressbut they are brief  
too often  yang devotes needless time to mundane scenesgrocery shopping  flowerarrangingin which nothing happens  little is said  no emotion imparted  
perhaps  if the film were content to focus on such reflective  inward moments  leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings  it might have been ambiguous  suggestive  insinuating  
but jiali and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence  they talk about their problems  at length  in detail  redundantly  and eliminate all subtleties  
at two hours and fortyfive minutes  it all seems exorbitantly long  indulgently longwinded  
consider the defining moment for jiali  the titular day on the beach  
the thrust of the whole film explains  easily enough  what we are to think of that moment  what it means when she walks away from a particular situation  
even so  the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally  in case we may have missed the point  
needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed  and that is the problem throughout  
the look of the film is as tedious as the drawnout narrative  
it was the first feature shot by christopher doyleat least  its his name in the creditswho is now rightly regarded as one of the worlds leading cinematographers  
in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong karwai  he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image  
you would never know it from watching that day  which  due either to doyles inexperience or yangs humdrum direction  is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible  
in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage  that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience  but none of the damage  none of the heartbreak
