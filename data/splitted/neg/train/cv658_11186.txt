senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a onejoke concept a bit too far  
director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this  having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies  
marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon  a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage  
however  he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition  scott thorpe  david spade  in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep   an athletic record  sponsorship by a fraternity  and  most of all  a wealthy family to back him up  
in fact  darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet  
but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel  
he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the universitys dr  wheedon  brad dourif   
as a result  his senses are magnified tenfold  
using his newfound abilities  he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job  unaware that there may be some disadvantageous sideeffects to having super senses   
naturally  marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle  giving jim carreyish amounts of physical humor  
the problem is  aside from a few genuinely inspired bits  theres not much thats funny here  
the film has its one central gag  and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor  
there obviously wasnt much thought put into the plot  
the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous  
i mean  why the emphasis on extracurricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a singleelimination quiz anyhow  
and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester  
to give it credit  senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryls roommate  tim laflour  matthew lillard   
apparently  he is supposed to be faddish  but the film never does anything with him  leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie  
his  intervention  scenes with darryl  however  do provide a rare  and welcome  laugh  
and then theres the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one  
in this case  the object of darryls amor is janice  tamara taylor   a fellow student who wont have anything to do with darryl until he gains his supersenses  
needless to say  the romance is completely extraneous  and adds little to the film  
this is a film that desperately needed something else  
be that a good plot  more jokes  or simply funnier ones   or a strong character or two  anything would have helped senseless get off the ground  
as it is  all the manic exuberant mugging in the world cant help marlon wayans get this one off the ground
