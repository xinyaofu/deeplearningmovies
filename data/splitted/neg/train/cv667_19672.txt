  the red violin  is a cold  sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached  
its a movie that seems almost clinical  as it traces the plusyears history of the legendary musical instrument of the title  
opening in the th century  the story shows how violinmaker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son  
but when tragedy strikes  the violin becomes the personification of its makers grief  
from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery  
again  tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph  
we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in maos communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz  samuel l  jackson   who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity  
the violin becomes morritzs obsession  just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it  
morritz  however  is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creators intention  
  the red violin  could have been a touching  inspirational story  as soaring as a beethoven symphony  
however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer  
here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact  
girard  for some unknown reason  uses mostly master shots  keeping his camera  and thus us  at a distance  
we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin  
its resonance  its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression  
nor are any of the performances memorable  
its as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin  
  the red violin  promises much  but delivers little  
it is dull at times  a bit pretentious and a might murky  
the movies music soars over its story and performers  
and that is its only saving grace
