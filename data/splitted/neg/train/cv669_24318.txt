ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film  i have a problem even regarding it as a film  
its more of a show  a big commercial for ted turners world championship wrestling  wcw   
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page  goldberg  and sting  
the story is very minimal and basic  
there are these two guys  gordy  david arquette  and sean  scott caan   
they are two twentysomething wrestling fans from wyoming  
when they go to a live event for the big match up  there favorite wrestler jimmy king  oliver platt  is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus  joe pantoliano   
gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans  
on the way  they meet some people  have some fun  and clean up some portopotties  
sounds great huh  well its not  
the movie makes many attempts at humor  only a few of them work  
the jokes that make you laugh  however  do not outnumber the films many duds  
there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa  
the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back  
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquettes tag team partner is macho man randy savage  
they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor  
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan  
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl  the cheerleaders of the wcw  
she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice  funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowans breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face  
now what didnt work in this movie  
that would be the rest of it  
the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets  
the two lead characters work for a portopotty cleaning company and when they crash the truck  the excrements spill all over the road  
its not funny  its pathetic and brainless  
the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way  
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie  
the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle  like that would happen to any fan  especially to  that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set  
also  i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily  they just walked right in  
i like wrestling  
i watch it at home and laugh  
its continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldnt watch it  
this movie wasnt even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv  
the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew  
the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently  
the movie was too dimwitted to be funny  
it is possibly the most useless and underdeveloped film ever  
a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film  detroit rock city  
that movie was interesting  well done and continuously funny unlike this film  
the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh  
now that the scream trilogy is over  arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb callatt ads  
at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox  
hes in the funny parts of the film but there arent enough to make him look good  
the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rocks  bawitdaba  and  cowboy   
martin landau has a great cameo as a classic  hardnosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne  
script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin  
a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it  
at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real  
the wrestlers form alliances  go to peoples houses and beat them up  
its utterly ridiculous  
the whole film was a wasteful  dumfounding experience  
the movie was made to pay homage to the fans  telling them things that made wrestling  not the wrestlers  
the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying  dollars to see a pottyhumor movie  
the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic twohour commercial to watch it  
if youre going to watch wrestling watch wwf  its actually entertaining  
the wrestling is betters  theyre funnier  more diverse  and have better entrance themes  
oh and the girls are hotter  
is this what movies have become   hourlong commercials that you have to pay to see  
dont waste your money
