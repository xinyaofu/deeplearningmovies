one of my brothers favorite movies is h  b  halickis  cult flick  gone is sixty seconds   one of the best products of the carchase genre that provided drivein fare during the s  
chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue  but they had a strong visceral appeal  
although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars  the remake of  gone in sixty seconds  is relatively weak and dull  
randall  memphis  raines  nicolas cage  is a retired car thief who runs a gocart track  
he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip  giovanni ribisi  would not take up boosting cars  
however  kip became a thief anyway  and now hes in big trouble  
kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri  christopher eccleston  by the end of the week  
calitri expects memphis to fulfill kips bargain  if he doesnt come through  kip dies  
memphis gathers his old crew  angelina jolie  robert duvall  will patton  chi mcbride  and vinnie jones   and kip brings his boys  t  j  
cross  william lee scott  scott caan  and james duval   
as if calitri breathing down their necks wasnt bad enough  the team is pursued by a cop  delroy lindo  whos still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster  rap star master p  who wants to take over calitris clients  
watching  gone   i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one  
maybe thats why the first fortynine are fairly easy  and the thrills are saved for  eleanor   a  shelby gto  a model that has always eluded memphis  
but the big chase doesnt live up to the long wait  
i had high hopes for  gone  because it is director dominic senas second film  
  kalifornia   his  debut  was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience  
in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot  a couple gives a serial killer a ride  and successfully endowed it with deeper significance  
in  gone  he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who cant communicate with each other  but that goal just doesnt mesh with this plot  
  gone  either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough  
its not light enough to be fun  or mean enough to be intense  
this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it  
the lack of action is a waste of the premise  which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever  
the weak script is a waste of a talented cast  
in a  newsweek  interview last year  sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies  
much as i like cage  for every good picture he does   leaving las vegas    bringing out the dead    there are two major stinkers   snake eyes    con air    mm    city of angels    
that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast  but cage has real talent  
its a shame to waste it in glitzy  superficial tripe like  gone in  seconds
