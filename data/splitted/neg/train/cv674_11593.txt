steve martin is one of the funniest men alive  
if you can take that as a true statement  then your disappointment at this film will equal mine  
martin can be hilarious  creating some of the best laughoutloud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters  
you wont find any of them here  
the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit  
bilko  and the name isnt an accident  is the head of an army motor pool group  but his passion is his schemes  
every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hairbrained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base  
  mchales navy  s granddaddy  
thats the idea behind this movie too  but the difference is that  as farfetched and usually goofy as the television series was  it was funny  
there is not one laugh in the film  
the remake retains the goofiness  but not the entertainment  
everything is just too clean  
it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it  
it all looks brand new  even the old beatup stuff  
martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role  
in the original  phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness  
martins bilko is a pale imitation  
the only semibright spot is phil hartman as bilkos archenemy  
its not saying much  considering martins lackluster character  but hartman leaves him in the dust
