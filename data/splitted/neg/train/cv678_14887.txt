who knew that in  years eddie murphy  who made such a brash  raucous bigscreen splash in hrs    
would become    
cuddly  
the disconcerting trend begun in this summers cutesy  largely laughfree doctordolittle continues with this earnesttoafault dramedy  
although he is topbilled  here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum  who plays ricky hayman  the programming director at a home shopping network  
sales are way down  and rickys job hangs by a thread until he meets g  murphy   a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air  
while sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation  the reinvigorated rickys greed grows  endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant  kelly preston   
writer tom schulman has some promising ideas  satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity  
but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film  
the sluggishly paced holyman is not only slow and overlong   minutes   but an unfunny bore  and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings  cleansed of both the attitude and comic sensibility that made him a star  g is  for the most part  a straight man   he is a curiously lifeless presence  
goldblum is actually quite good  but its hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesnt seem to be much interested  either
