  he doesnt have a hardtodecipher accent    he doesnt always speak in a monotone  and   
his face doesnt always wear the same impassive expression  
in short  the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad  but too bad to be good  
unfortunately  the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle  firestorm  which is just plain awful  
one of the most glaring problems with long  who made his acting debut in john woos broken arrow  is that hes so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery  
as ace firefighter jesse graves  long is supposed to be playing a biggerthanlife action hero  the kind of he man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers  
unfortunately  despite the best efforts of firsttime director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costners work in the postman look stark  jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy  
to put it kindly  this is not a wellwritten motion picture  
firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich  s which  taken together  form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot  
the only reason this film is getting one star  instead of something lower  is that most of the fire sequences are realistic  and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively  
were introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people  
during this sequence  our big burly hero proves that hes also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog  yes  the dog lives  from being broiled alive  
flashforward a year  
now  our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association  replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins  real actor scott glenn   
but this day  our big burly heros first in charge  isnt going to be businessasusual  
a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom  
led by randy earl shaye  william forsythe   the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die  they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border  
along the way  they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress  suzy amis   
eventually  our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire  rescue the damsel in distress  defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die  and restore order to the galaxy  
firestorms director  dean semler  is a former cinematographer  he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves   so its no surprise that the film looks good  
unfortunately  thats firestorms lone asset  and it falters near the end  when computergenerated special effects fill up the screen  
these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo  video game  
the action sequences  which include a variety of chases  are occasionally interesting  but never invigorating  
everyone  including long  appears to be going through the motions  
there isnt a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end  unless you count the forest fire  which generates some heat  
as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die  william forsythe lacks panache  
hes worse than a generic bad guy  hes a boring generic bad guy who doesnt have any snappy oneliners to hurl at our big burly hero  
my advice to scott glenn  absolute power  and suzy amis  titanic  is to accidentally forget this film the next time theyre making out a resume  
theres some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom  list  
  at least i hope there arent  worse films than this   
and i know i wasnt the only one who really disliked this movie  
as the audience was filing out of the screening  i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments  
the general consensus seemed to be that  although the movie sucked  the promotional key ring was cool  
the problem is that fox wont be giving out key rings to regular moviegoers  so that nixes any reason to see firestorm
