in the first death wish movie  mildmannered new york architect paul kersey  played by charles bronson  was avenging the death of his wife  
in the second  he was avenging his daughter  
in the third  he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend  
fourth movie  on the other hand  begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen  played by kay lenz  
however  since this is death wish movie  we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for  
this time karens teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways  
kerseys new targets  unlike the previous movies  arent the ordinary street punks but rich  heavily armed and wellconnected drug dealers  
even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support  and it comes from the publisher nathan white  john p  ryan   determined to avenge the drugrelated death of his own daughter  
whites plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them  
the plan begins to take shape  but kerseys actions bring attention of two police detectives  reiner  george dickerson  and nozaki  soon teckoh   
fourth  and  unfortunately  not the final  installment in the death wish series  will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group  production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade  
however  although some critics might argue  death wish   the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish   paul kersey  one of the most intriguing  and potentially controversial  characters of the s  is still being dumbed down by mediocre script  and charles bronson really doesnt feel the need to put much effort in his acting  
however  the hand of a veteran director j  lee thompson seems more capable of michael winners and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal  although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring  
there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence  and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end  
the script even tries to fake some social conscience  through criminally underused kay lenzs character  and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years  
there are even some halfhearted attempts of humour  both intentional and unintentional  like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle  but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronsons s classics  
  special note to xphiles  mith pilleggi  the actor who plays ad skinner in the x files  could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman
