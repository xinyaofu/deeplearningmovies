ive never written a review for a movie i havent watched all the way through  but i had to make an exception with powder  
i was about fortyfive minutes into this one at a friends house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and im sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it  because i saw enough to know this one wasnt worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager whos spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house  
when grandpa dies  taking his department store down with him   social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder  first and middle names  
gold bond  to a state home  where we find out hes a different from the other kids  
actually  we find out hes different when we first see him  because hes the most pale individual weve ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie  the father takes one look at him and says  hes not my son   
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the whitefaced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is  until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him  wear  his spoon   you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass   
decisions  decisions     and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy  his mother must be sissy spaceks carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes  as we find out powder has some sort of superintelligence   your i  q  
test went straight off the chart    
and attracts electrical power  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school  if hes such a genius already  why would he need a high school education   and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblums science class  
goldblum plugs in a  jacobs ladder  device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powders chest  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching  instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row  following hideaway and nine months   
thats about all i saw before the big fight began and  let me tell you  that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said  i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly  instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guys personality  overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out  the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene   but i guess ill never know for sure what happened
