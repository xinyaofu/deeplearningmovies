this is the movie that could singlehandedly bring  mystery science theater   out of cancellation  
its one of those movies thats so bad its absolutely hilarious  due in no small part to its big star  supermodel cindy crawford  
if you only remember one thing about fair game  it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues  
if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l  a   youll change your mind when you see fair game  
ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition  
in a real casting coup  crawford plays a superintelligent lawyer  in a jogging bra  of course   
we all know this is a stretch  the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day  
nonetheless  someone out there thought shed make a good lawyer  but were reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes  
and for you horny teenage boys out there  you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark    
come to think of it  that may have been a body double  
cindy crawford isnt black  is she  
like i said  crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her  
billy baldwin  or is it stephen  
alec  
adam  
kim basinger   is the police detective who has to save her life  time after time  chase after chase  explosion after explosion  
theres absolutely nothing original about this movie  
its every cop show of the s mixed with every action thriller of the s and every technology exploitation movie of the s  
three decades of crap all in one place  driven further into the ground by crawfords complete lack of acting talent  
and its all completely predictable  
you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them  you know when the  sexual tension  will finally end up in them consummating the relationship  you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movies going to suck from the first scene  
the plot isnt really explained until the end  
all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer  
in the words of one of the villains   we even know what size pantyhose she wears   
  yeah  you and every yearold boy in america   
he goes on to add   we know more about her than she does   
  that i find very easy to believe   
i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes  because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones   if it werent for me  youd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba    
because  you see  fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting  but also some seriously bad dialogue  
it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasnt supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh  
one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief  
would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like  im very interested in hardware  and other crap about playing with his joystick  
i wouldnt  but not because im a computer nerd  
its just not funny  
crawfords only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords body    
or was it jack lords body  
ill leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie  
the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft  
crawford says woodenly   that was my clients boat you just blew up  
im filing a lawsuit against you  
youre in big trouble   or something to that effect  and baldwin replies smugly   what do i have to do to get out of it   
they of course begin making out and the credits roll  
im not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how  if theyd really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say   you think i could settle out of court   
but i will tell you that  if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her  you quote the final line of the movie to that person   what do i have to do to get out of it   
serving america for over th of a century
