fit for a ghouls night out  fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic  fatuous  builtin excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls  
being a boy  i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudofeminist comingofage story  
fair enough  
ill pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class   this is a nono  dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass  speaking variations on  it wont hurt   
for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes  
this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism  
they dare you to look away  without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children  theyre mouthpieces for writerdirector catherine breillats onenote clinical politics   
rather than show an evenhanded evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change  breillat  previously responsible for the unwatchable romance  wants to indulge in her hour of hate  
life is pain  highness  
get used to it  
shed find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz  other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest  
for children  dealing with trauma and pain is complicated  
to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap  
these wouldbe auteurs  more like hauteurs  havent earned the right to display suffering because they dont layer it in emotional truth  as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet   
of course  there i go again comparing her to all these  better  male directors  
i dont care  
gender be damned  shes borderline inept  
braced for a kneejerk reaction from the art house crowd  mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice   writerdirector catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people  
dont be fooled  
this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten  remembered only as cold  boring  philosophically arid  and incompetently photographed  
the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence  
twelve years old  a bundle of dough with a sour pout  the superb ana  s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance  
  her character is also named ana  s   
sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split  her presence is grounded and heartbreaking  
its a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister  year old elena  roxane mesquida   for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room  
in this summer cottage  ana  s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elenas depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance  
the boy in question  a smug italian college kid named fernando  libero de rienzo  is a real piece of work  claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob  
ana  s doesnt receive any warmth from her largely absent parents  who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth  
she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone  singing songs to herself  and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that its her paramour  
reboux commands the screen  but theres only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself  
if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie  at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they werent so dramatically misguided  
this minute vignette is something of a horror show  but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end  
on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members  gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late  
will mommy fall asleep at the wheel  
perhaps  
or maybe theres something deadlier around the corner  lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl  
whats more  she might even like it  
with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable  placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood  breillats extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt  
fat girl is a bitter pill indeed
