  marie couldnt talk   paulie  the parrot star of his own movie  tells us about the daughter in his original family  
  dad couldnt listen  
and mom couldnt cope  so they got rid of me   
paulie  the autobiography of a talking  not merely a mimicking  parrot  has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird  the voice  not the body  and as the minor character of benny  a smalltime crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms  
as the parrot  mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up  
benny  on the other hand  is a character youve seen a thousand times before  and mohr brings nothing new to that role  
robertss deliberately slow pacing of laurie craigs script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems  
when a kids movie wants to mosey along  watch out  
if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed  beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium  
so it is with paulie  
when they let their bird do his standup comedy routines  the show hums and the audience roars  
too often  however  a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again  
tony shalhoub  the smartmouthed chef from big night  plays misha  a recent russian immigrant to the u  s  he had been a teacher of literature at home  but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study  
although misha gets a few nice lines   im russian  
i like long stories     
his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy  
besides paulie  the only character worth noting  other than  cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands  is the speechimpaired marie  played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer  yearold hallie kate eisenberg  
naturally enchanting  she gives the picture genuine heart  
the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half  
the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills  
when maries family gets a cat  for example  the bird  who hasnt wanted to learn how to fly until then  takes an instant interest in soaring  
tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time  paulie calls him a stupid hairball  
their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation  
its good quality sitcom material but performed by animals  
when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing  paulie cringes  
  im a bird   he explains with his frequently subtle humor  
  i have a small brain  and its about to explode   
the movie contains rich doses of john debneys dreamy music  
with heavy use of a solo violin  he keeps reinforcing the films heartwarming themes  
and when paulie finally takes off in flight  the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing  
  its a long story   says paulie  
  its the only kind he knows   reflects misha  
and the motion picture  which runs the standard length for a kids movie  still feels too long  
the best parts are enthralling  but then there are all of those dead spots inbetween  
paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless  
paulie runs     
it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages  
my son  jeffrey  age   gave the movie   with his biggest complaint being that there wasnt enough action  
he thought paulie was funny  and the actress that played marie was quite good  
his friend sam  almost   thought the movie was  awesome  excellent   and gave it      
he thought paulie was good  but he didnt believe the way maries speech impediment was acted
