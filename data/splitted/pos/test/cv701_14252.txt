modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before  from teenage sitcoms to ncrated films about fetishes  
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it  
  your friends and neighbors  takes a different approach as its a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends  
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writerdirector neil labutes basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story  
firstly  and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex  detailed story of lust  betrayal  arrogance  hypocrisy  greed  and just plain stupidity between six different characters  three men  three women   without hardly any supporting characters   a few have a line or two   mostly extras  
everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come fullcircle back to themselves  whether it be positive or negative  
but to just state this is arbitrary  and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult  
labutes ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat  but whats specifically impressive is the fact the characters names are never revealed until the end credits roll  
for the sake of this review  i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic  
another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus  
were always able to tell where the characters are  someones home  the gym  a restaurant  hotel room  etc    but what the city they live in  what year it is  what the society is like  etc  is relatively unknown  
the film is a complete character study with the tight  intense drama of the theater  
no one plot dominates the story  which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background  
were simply dropped in on the characters lives and are expected to figure out the rest  
the characters are a group of middleclass white people who are all successful at what they do  but theyre only concern right now seems to be their sex lives  
first theres barry  eckhart  and mary  brenneman   a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who dont know what theyre problem is  
barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife  and the sex they have  but doesnt have a lot of ambition  he just follows everyone else  
mary is a writer of some sort  but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character  but ironically  doesnt hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something  
labutes script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals  but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two  
obviously  this is the theme  which is enhanced by the actors good performances  but at the same time seems just a bit hollow  
another couple is jerry  stiller  and terri  keener  who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time  yet they constantly argue over anything and everything  
their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship  
if only one aspect of the film could use improvement  it would be this area  
its natural for a married couple to become bored with each other  but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together  
what did they ever see in the other person to begin with  
labute never really answers  but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process  it still makes for good drama  tension  and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful its fascinating  
two other characters act as catalysts  cary  jason patric  and cheri  natassja kinski   
cary is an arrogant  hostile sexmaniac who defines the word  bastard   
somehow he is able to bend women to his will  either through charm or just attitude  into getting his way  
hes the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize hes secretly perverted  but somehow barry finds comfort in his company  although jerry is always nervous around him  
patric gives an outstanding performance  so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is  
cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her  
she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film  each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different  from becoming involved in a relationship with one  to brushing it off as small talk with another  to being outright appalled by yet another  
shes a sweet woman  perhaps the most normal of any of the characters  and although her symbolism is obvious  her role as the outsider is the most relatable  
i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others action  as thats the hook of the film  
the first two acts begin to set up the characters and eachs scenarios  but its often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom  
the result is sometimes surprising  other times predictable  but the actual course of actions is always fascinating  
for a while everyone has their fun  but ultimately each characters guilt  attitude  or ignorance will disserve them  
one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be  
since the characters only interact with each other there isnt much pop culture references  as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it  
are we to assume that these people are  as the title states  our friends and neighbors  
i dont know of anyone going through the same situations as these people  
often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama  other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie  
but what this film does have that the others dont is repercussions in the end  
although the film creates its own reality  it goes to show that even the immoral arent immortal  
in what way  your friends and neighbors  is supposed to work is open to interpretation  
it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity  but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically  
still  its an accomplishment in filmmaking because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective
