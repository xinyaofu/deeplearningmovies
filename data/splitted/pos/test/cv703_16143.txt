  youve got mail  is the very definition of a  cute  movie  
its got cute stars  a cute storyline  and even cute pets  
despite this overwhelming cuteness  or maybe because of it   i loved  youve got mail   
i know  i know  
im supposed to be a film critic  
im not supposed to love transparent and formula pictures like this  
but darn it  somewhere along the way   youve got mail  reeled me in  hook  line  and sinker  
the movie stars tom hanks and meg ryan as two somewhat unhappy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room and quickly become close friends  without ever knowing each others identity  
as the movie progresses  though  they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each other  
meanwhile  in  reallife   they are bitter competitors  
she owns a quaint little childrens bookstore  he owns one of those gigantic superbookstores that offer impersonal service and discount prices  
while his store threatens to run her store out of business  their online relationship grows stronger  
  youve got mail  is as artificial as movies come  
everything is nice and happy and by the end  all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life  
there are no real conflicts  no major disappointments  no unresolved issues  
nevertheless  i quite enjoyed it  
in fact  i cant remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies  
i think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it  
the fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either  
in particular  hanks is at his best here  turning his  charmmeter  up to   
everytime he was on screen  he had my full attention  
and despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business  i was rooting for him  
it was good to see hanks back doing what he does best  playing the affable everyman  
  youve got mail  certainly wont be winning any awards  but as an exercise in pure entertainment  its as good as it gets
