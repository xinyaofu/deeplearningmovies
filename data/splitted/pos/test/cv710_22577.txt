run lola run  a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival  is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance  
for a berserk and retroactive  minutes of nonstop movement  we follow a fieryhaired heroine named lola  franka potente  as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers  
lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve    marks in time to save manni  moritz bleibtreu  from being killed by the dealer  
but  in something of a pseudo groundhog day approach  director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal  
in these trio of episodes  we gradually learn the unique effects of fate  for even if tiny changes are made in lolas journey  the future can be seriously altered  
run lola run is an experience like fight club or the matrix  in that each film takes you through a supercharged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways  
in addition  all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack  
lola is no exception  with stylish quickflash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the getgo  
tykwers world is a landscape of mood and color  with brilliant shades of red and pink  including lolas fiery hair  used as effective symbolism throughout  
with its visual style and mindblowing pace  run lola run is one of the more invigorating movies of the year  
even more so when considering the fact its all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an minute time period  
as a heroine  potente does little more than run wildly through the streets  as the title suggests   but she has a certain flair and charisma  
her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star  
meanwhile  bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life  
both actors perform beyond the call of duty  
the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola  and the outcome is ultimately rewarding  several twists and turns are unique and unexpected  
the other characters lola runs into  both purposely and inadvertently  include her banker father  herbert kraup  and a friendly security guard  armin rohde   but aside from the two leads  no one has more than a few minutes of screen time  
additional stars that couldnt possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy  who are both responsible for the films eyecatching visual elegance  
run lola run is subtitled  so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightningfast dialogue  occasional sections of it are especially fast  
this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching  
the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation  
most are just chess pieces in tykwers elaborate game of visual presentation  and he never really makes a significant move with any  
but  the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay  
a few petty gripes aside  this film is a wild  exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality  
most people believe foreign films are mainly boring  talky character studies  
perhaps run lola run will recharge their batteries  
not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny  it also delivers a whiteknuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity  
like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character  run lola run is exhausting
