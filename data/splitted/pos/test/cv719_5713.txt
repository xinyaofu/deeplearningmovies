with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up  loading their guns  kissing each other and uttering what sounds like  rock and roll   
  actually  its  lock and load    you cant help thinking tarantino  
and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery  the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie  clyde to natural born killers  
but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction  exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run  normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon  
  inspired by true events   weve heard that one before  and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated    
or so strangely poignant  
for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality  who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged  
beginning with their final arrest  the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris  luke perry   a policeman  and pam  ashley judd   a factory worker  
they fall in love and marry  but pams increasingly erratic behaviour  going on spending sprees  slashing herself with a knife after an argument  begin to trouble the solid and stable chris  
when chris gets sacked  they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up  
then  chris begins to rob banks    
luke perry accomplishes the notinconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills  or buffy the vampire slayer  
moustached  with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation  he is perfectly cast as the longsuffering husband  
  its another of john mcnaughtons coups of castingagainsttype  after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory   
but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage  and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness  making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person  
if the performance falls short of greatness  however  it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema  whether its in betty blue  tom  viv or georgia  
as in those movies  theres the danger that the performance seems mannered  a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece  
judd doesnt entirely avoid this pitfall  but pams craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more normal chris  
when pam reacts to her fatherinlaws death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones  chris face is the picture of pained restraint  
of course  its the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life  
mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity  
it is the rational chris that loves guns   shooting is about precision  control   and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog  who is then called chaos   chaos and you and me    
were a real family   she notes wryly   
it is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber  his wellplanned disguise as a bearded  roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness   
in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery  a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background   buymore   the perfectly respectable consumptioncrazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases  and both of them into desperate situations  
its not a perfect film  
some of the dialogue is a touch too banal  perhaps intentionally    
the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pams crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film  
indeed  as in mcnaughtons seminal film henry  portrait of a serial killer  it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism  the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre  that gives this determinedly unflashy  moving film its great strengths  
mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet  coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer  
the suburbs  with their miles of whitefenced houses and identikit malls  take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness  
in its very different way  this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malicks badlands  
while pam shares the yearnings of malicks heroes to escape from ordinary life  chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a normal life  their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies  
but these are dreams defined by  constrained by  and even doomed by  the limitations of the normal  conventional world  
pams final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs  where wild bushes grow  symbolically the frontier  the outer limits of her society  but also quite literally the end of the road  where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
     amazing  potent stuff  
      perfection  
see it twice
