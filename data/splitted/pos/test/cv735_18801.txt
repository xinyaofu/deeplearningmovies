vannesa kensington  austin  do you smoke after sex   austin powers  i dont know baby  ive never looked   
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers   the sequel to the sleeper hit of   is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging s spy and his archnemesis  the bald headed dr  evil  who is given much of the spotlight here  
theres an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott  seth green  appear on a jerry springer segment entitled my dad is evil and wants to take over the world  hosted by springer himself  
most of these talkshow gags  spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee  are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily  this is an exception  especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
  sample dialogue come back here you mother    
you want a piece of me    
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by minime  verne troyer   a pintsized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
minime is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for  and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does  pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina  evils loudmouth assassin sidekick  and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward  theres even a meeting at the coffee machine  where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh  yes    
the plot  
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington  elizabeth hurley  that goes disastrously wrong  powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr  evil  
in the original  the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods  
here  its time travel  
dr  evil has this crazy plan to steal austins mojo  the source of his sexual powers   so he jumps through a time portal back into  when powers is still is his freezing chamber  
there  he employs a grotesque pound scottish assassin named fat bastard  also myers  to commandeer the mojo  so that our future hero is left completely shagless  
meanwhile  austin is informed of evils wrongdoing by basil exposition  michael york   and is supplied with his very own timetraveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle  
once back in   powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell  heather graham   and learns of dr  evils plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon  
in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars  evil calls the moon base a death star  
if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke  its austin powers  the spy who shagged me  
ap has many hilarious moments  much more so  than the original austin powers  
but what it doesnt have is the confident support system that the first boasted  and the jokes are now more scattershot and hitandmiss  
while myers has a knack for delivering clever  inspired gags  he sometimes doesnt know when to call it quits  
the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa  will ferrell  and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner  
robert wagner  as dr  evils  man  has only one scene early on in the film  where he lacks all the focus of the character  
one nice surprise is rob lowe  as the young   who patterns wagners voice and movements right down to a tee  
there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor  including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot  an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina   
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project  and many bits are sidesplittingly funny  
dont miss an extended visual gag in a tent  where the shadows leave much to the imagination     
of the new characters  graham doesnt leave much of an impression  
her performance is merely okay  and she lacks the gungho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her  
and as for fat bastard    
well  he provides one or two hilarious moments  but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far  
but my most severe complaint  mr  bigglesworth was only in one scene   
but  with gritted teeth  i managed to get over that  
this sequel will not leave fans disappointed  its more often than not a laugh riot  
and  i look optimistically to the future  where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection  
if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas  we should be in store for much more
