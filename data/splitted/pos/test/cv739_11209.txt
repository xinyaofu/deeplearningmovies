you know youre in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in questions most normal character  
such is the case with  the big lebowski   joel and ethan coens first venture since their  fargo  nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods  
theres no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment  because  lebowski  is an effort that makes words like  strange  and  unusual  seem like an understatement  
thanks in part to delicious characterization and an allencompassing sense of humor  the film is a smashing success  
the central oddball here is the dude  jeff bridges   an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot  drinking beer and going bowling  are you college students already rooting for him  or what    
one night  a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet  a threatening act thats supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire  david huddleston  who shares his birth name  jeff lebowski  with the dude  
once the dude realizes this coincidence  he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug  and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter  john goodman   a hotheaded vietnam vet  and donny  buscemi   a mildmannered surfer  before too long  
soon  though  lebowskis trampy trophy wife bunny  tara reid  is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom  and he turns to the dude for help  
it seems bunnys troubles are related to a line of work shes kept secret from her husband  shes actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn  
the dude  now on lebowskis payroll  accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop  walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself  
chaos obviously ensues  and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops  crooks and lebowskis ultraeccentric artist daughter maude  julianne moore   
  the big lebowski  deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that  fargo  did  while that  black comedy was certainly a better film   lebowski  is at least as breathtakingly imaginative  
the movie boasts a milehigh absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over  but thankfully never does  
the coens  joel directed  ethan produced and both wrote  keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale  and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick  
whether were watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeleyesque dream sequence   the big lebowski  is immensely lively  
there are those who will dislike this film  but not because its boring  
the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material theyre given  
bridges exudes a likeable  surprisingly sweet presence  his dude sure isnt the cleanest guy around  but youd still follow him to another movie  
goodman merits s first oscar consideration  as walters manic temper is one of  the big lebowski  s many highlights  the same goes for moore  whose throaty  delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot  
john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction  
sam elliotts rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start  
and some will recognize peter stormare   fargo  s silent heavy  as carl hungus  a porn star whos really a samurai swordwielding german nihilist and hasbeen pop star  
only in its final third does the movie falter  with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call  
these flaws are forgivable  though  the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that its hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face  
without a doubt   the big lebowski  is the best film so far this year  
sure  were only three months in and the competition   deep rising    desperate measures    the wedding singer   etc   has been pretty bland  but its still the gospel truth  
maybe during next awards season   lebowski  wont be a far cry from  fargo
