eight years after its release  disney has decided to rerelease the little mermaid theatrically for  days  and  long nights  only  
coincidentally  it was reintroduced to theaters the same day foxs animated film anastasia was released  
you know disney  they cant deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie  so when someone else wants to make a little money  they counter with an old  masterpiece  from their vault and  you know what  i went to see this  cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox  
let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market  
they still have hotels on boardwalk and park place  
believe it or not  today  november     at    p  m   i saw the little mermaid for the first time  
it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago  when i stayed with one of my moms friends for a couple weeks  
they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and  over that two week period  i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times  
by the time i got back home  i promised myself id never see the movie  
but promises are made to be broken  especially when youre looking at a day  limited engagement  
damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games  
the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale  but its disneyized  which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song  
it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times  
i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells    
the heroine  of course  is ariel  voice of jodi benson   a yearold mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase  
she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett  who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans  
shes also dealing with feelings she hasnt had before  which comes when you get scales in places you didnt use to have them  about a handsome prince  no disney movie would be complete without one   
her father  king triton of the merpeople  strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the  savage  humans  in a condemnation that reads as a notsosubtle analogy about old fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating  
whats a king to do  though  
the girls in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesnt deter her  
ariel saves the princes life when a hurricane rises up  and just has to meet him  
she makes a deal with ursula  the sea witch  voice of pat carroll   
you know shes evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history  
she also has octopus tentacles for feet  something those dr  scholls corn pads will not fix  and offers to help ariel out  
shell make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice  ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her  or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever  
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple  shell fall asleep forever  
its a simplistic plot  yes  but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world  coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company  
it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons  certainly since the s  
all the elements are there  memorable songs like  under the sea  and  kiss the girl   cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder  an evil villain who still has characterization and charm  and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children  
the little mermaid is worth a bigscreen ticket in   so hurry up  you only have five days left  
serving america for more than th of a century
