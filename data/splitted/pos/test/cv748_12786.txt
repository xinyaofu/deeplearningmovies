a movie thats been as highly built up as the truman show  with reviews boasting   the film of the decade   
and  a breakthrough   
can only be leading up to letdown  
thats no doubt  it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think youre going in for the ride of your life  that youll end up changed on the other side  and you come out of the theater going   eh    
  thats  what all the fuss was about   
so  naturally  the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment  
and i convinced myself  as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair  actually to try not to enjoy it  
let me tell you  that is an impossibilty  
the truman show is truly  the film of the decade  and  a breakthrough  and more  
and you will come out changed on the other side  
such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime  where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling  and this  friends  is it  
jim carrey shows that he doesnt need to talk out of his butt to entertain us  that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywoods leading men  
the film has a difficult premise to tackle  trying to set us up thirty years into the  truman shows  run  but tackle it it does  and perfectly  
with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show  you get the sense that you are viewing a  real  primetime hit  
and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the  real  truman show is clever and welldone  
people  rejoice  
this is the first oscarworthy film of not only this year  but of the last five years  
not since  schindlers list  has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well  
this is a classic in the making  and  to borrow a line from esquires review  it stars jim carrey  
nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank  mark my word  
for  as i said  this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre  
forget specialeffect ladden summer fodder  
drop your romantic comedies in the trash  
toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile  
you need nothing more than  the truman show  to carry you through the summer  or for that matter  the year  
oh  and in case i dont see you  good afternoon  good evening  and goodnight
