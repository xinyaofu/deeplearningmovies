gos is a gloriously slick hip machine  
director liman  who also photographed go  and screenwriter august celebrate the drugrave scene in l  a   preferring to take  comedic  snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them  
after more than ninety minutes of pillpopping  tantric sex  car chases  and attempted murder  go even has a happy ending  
this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches  as go wound down  i anticipated an antipillpoppingcasualtantricsexcarchaseattemptedmurder sermon that  blessedly  didnt arrive  
a la tarantinos pulp fiction  go is comprised of three separate but related stories  
the basics are as follows  ronna  polley  is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough  
her coworker  simon  the improbably named askew   is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas  
zack  mohr  and adam  wolf  are soap opera stars escaping a careerthreatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop  fichtner  in a drug bust  
perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantinos nonlinear masterwork is by now old hat  the idfueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me  with the exception of that mindreading cat    
pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen  but we see gos wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last  
torontonian polley  of the sweet hereafter  refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was  not pleased with  her turn as the illfated cashier  
in go  she delivers  handsdown  her best performance to date  
heres an  overrated  actress who agreed to appear on the poster  but not support her team at the junket or in interviews  this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms  polley  as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you  
if she doesnt want to be the ingenue of the moment  she should have said  no   not go  
but i digress  
go is a fun film  so chipperly depraved one cant help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride  
in that sense  its a departure from limans last film  swingers  which at least lectured against selfabsorption in the form of vince vaughans trent and his subtle comeuppance in the storys clever epilogue  which has been aped by mcdonalds for their latest commercial   
i wish i cared more about gos characters  like the techno music they listen to  the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous  
when the lights came up and stung my eyes  it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me  
yet entertain me it did  
go is light and frothy  featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley  timothy olyphant  scream    and especially fichtner  whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs  
fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers  in heat  armageddon  and others   his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go  
unlike much of the film  fichtner is unpredictable
