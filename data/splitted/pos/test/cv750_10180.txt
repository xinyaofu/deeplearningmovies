whats shocking about  carlitos way  is how good it is  
having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacinos previous film   scent of a woman   and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one  he had just won an oscar    carlitos way  was destined for underrated heaven  
thats what it is  an underrated gem of a movie  
and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it  and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study  
  carlitos way  deals with  well  carlito brigante  pacino   a puerto rican exdrug kingpin  who gets out of a long jailterm when his cokeaddicted  curlyhaired lawyer  sean penn  points out a legal technicality  
of course  carlito was actually awoken in prison  and has decided to go straight  even if hes really a crook at heart  
carlito  like barry lyndon  is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn  and cant escape into something he is not  
carlitos attempts at a clean  legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn  
when he first gets out  a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shootout  where he has to kill a couple people to survive  
hes constantly getting bugged by the government to see if hes doing anything illegal  and his lawyer finds himself neckdeep in a pile of shit  needing him to try and help him out  which includes him doing some prison breaking  
carlito  like ratso rizzo  wants to go to miami  since  according to film logic  thats where its at   but needs some funding  
being a legend  he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club  this is the s  by the way  and since some of this takes place in night clubs  we get to hear all sorts of s classics  including several k  c  
and the sunshine band tunes  my personal favorite   
he gets a bodyguard  the great luis guzman  at his best   and is soon running a pretty good business  even if hes constantly attracting underworld young thugs  like benny blanco  from the bronx   john leguiziamo   who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito  
on the other side  the symbol of promise and hope  is gail  penelope ann miller  what happened to her    his girlfriend from before prison  
shes a goregeous ballerina  and a stripper  and soon carlito is trying to get back with her  and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami  
while this relationship is never fully defined or anything  we get a sense of love between them  and they have some truly interesting scenes between them  she never gives him addresses or locales  he always has to track her down   
all of these elements clash together at the end  in a brilliantly executed  emotional climax  which is inevitable  
when i say inevitable  i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack  putting a great spin on it  
sure  its going to eleveate some of the tension  but it gives the film a lot of depth  as carlito is seen trapped by fate  
whats amazing is the big chase sequence  amazingly done by de palma  has a lot of tension and thrills  
like  apollo    we know whats going to happen  but were still thrilled by what happens in the middle  
its also very emotional  thanks to a great script by david koepp  and amazing performances by pacino and miller  
de palma is famous  or infamous  for lots of violence in his films  
his earlier flim   scarface   which starred pacino in the lead   has a ton of it  especially at the end  and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which im still not over   
but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes  
to me  the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building  looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet  
this is the most brilliantly done  and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film  and probably the best in de palma film history  
with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background  and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlitos head  and a saddened  remorseful look on pacinos face  its a tearjerker  well  for me  i dunno about you      
the acting from all is great  especially from the three leads  
pacino was panned for his performance  chiefly because his accent wasnt puerto rican enough and  well  it wasnt as  strong  as his oscarwinning role in  scent of a woman   
well  his  scent of a woman  performance was great and all  but it was nothing really but  as comic kevin pollack said  a  foghorn leghorn impression   
in  carlitos way   hes emotional  and strong  despite the fact that hes remorseful over his entire lifestyle  which he cannot change  
i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tangodancing  insultthrowing blind guy in  scent of a woman   
as i said  penelope ann miller is great  and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry  
and theyre scenes are wellwritten  with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship  
and sean penn is amazing as the cokeaddicted rat attorney  
every scene hes in  he has great energy  and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino  
in smaller roles  john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great  
  carlitos way  is one of those films which you heard about briefly  but when you finally watch it  youre absolutely blown away  
its a wonderful film  a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didnt do so hot  
but trust me and check it out  
its a great little film  and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right
