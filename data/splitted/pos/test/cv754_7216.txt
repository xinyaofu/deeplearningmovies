kolya is one of the richest films ive seen in some time  
zdenek sverak plays a confirmed old bachelor  whos likely to remain so   who finds his life as a czech cellist increasingly impacted by the fiveyear old boy that hes taking care of  
though it ends rather abruptly and im whining  cause i wanted to spend more time with these characters the acting  writing  and production values are as high as  if not higher than  comparable american dramas  
this fatherandson delight sverak also wrote the script  while his son  jan  directed won a golden globe for best foreign language film and  a couple days after i saw it  walked away an oscar  
in czech and russian  with english subtitles
