anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia  wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes  deep  vibrant colors and an epic storyline  
its true beauty comes from its subtle ruminations on the politics of power  whether its between governments  or the interplay between a man and a woman  
anna  jodie foster  is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband  
with son in tow  she takes the employ of king mongkut  chow yunfat  to tutor his son in the english language  
mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his countrys future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world  
anna function is to help provide that link  
the core of the film  of course  deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate  
foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wideeyed wonder  
she is assertive  yet  respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him  
it is one of fosters strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career  
she brings a mature self awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster  
its a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkuts monarchy  
when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet midfilm  she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance  
chowyun fats king mongkut is every measure of fosters anna  perhaps even more so  
this is the chow yunfat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years  
he is imposing  yet vulnerable  playful  but stern  
it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance  
precious time is stolen from the movies  minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the kings concubines  bai ling  and her love of a commoner  
it strikes with the subtlety of siams fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story  
some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie  
although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film  it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma  a country backed by the british  
anna and the king transcends being a predictable  traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness  
it shows a seduction of intelligence  
ever mindful of each others positions  anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs  conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying  if not achingly bittersweet
