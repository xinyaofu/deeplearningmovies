is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of alltime  
its quite possible  
his career spanned over  years  and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could  
yet  when he is talked about in the media  he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role  the nice guy  
and thats really a shame  
  the naked spur  features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him  
its a western  which stewart specialized in around this period  and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend  
before he finds that man  though  he runs into two men who agree to help him  thinking he is a sheriff  
when the criminal is eventually caught  the two men discover stewarts secret  and decide they want a piece of the action too  
the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly  
also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal  well played by janet leigh  
were never too sure whos side shes really on until the end  
leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the  shower lady  from  psycho   and thats unfair  
she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men  
stewart gives a performance unlike anything ive ever seen from him  
he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs  but here  he gets downright hysterical at times  
i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a  nice guy   
his performance borders on psychotic at times  but i loved watching every second of it  
its roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do  
he was an actor unafraid to take chances  and even ruin his public image
