almost a full decade before steven spielbergs saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both  anti war  and  prosoldier   john irvins hamburger hill proved it could  
lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stones platoon  this excellent film was dismissed as  too militaristic   
its hard to understand exactly whyunless irvin  in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable  and often naive  reasons  chose to show up  for the vietnam debacle  has refused to present us with the stone killer  drugstoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what  the polack  the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn  became to wwii movies  
hamburger hill  based on a true story  is not an easy film to watch  
there is a scene that will have graying antiwar activists squirming in their seats  or moved to genuine tears  
and the climactic final assault on the  hill  in question is visually confusing  
gristly realities are presented in brief flashes  as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered  
and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee  veteran and  newbie   black soldier and white  become almost indistinguishable from each other  as they do in the chaos of actual combat  
the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b  vance as docin a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as  seaman jones  in mctiernans red october  
if youve seen private ryan  you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hillif only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielbergs vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach
