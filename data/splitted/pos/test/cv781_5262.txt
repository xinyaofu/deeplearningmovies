robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire  one with class and style  
the film  set in old detroit in the year   stars peter weller as murphy  a lieutenant on the citys police force  
s detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor  security concepts inc   whose employees  the cops  are threatening to strike  
to make matters worse  a savage group of copkillers has been terrorizing the city  
on murphys first day of duty  after his transfer from another precinct  these copkillers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one  
  orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m  p  a  a   
after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead  s  c  i  
recruits his remains for their new  robocop  program  
using the remains of murphys body as a foundation  their scientists build a cyborg  made of both flesh and metal  
the cyborg  robocop  is half human  murphy  and half robot  the s  c  i  
engineers have erased murphys memory and replaced it with a computer program  or so they think   
with his lightning quick reflexes  immense strength  and impenetrable armor  s  c  i  
envisions robocop as an indestructible supercop  the solution to detroits problems  
the remainder of the plot follows robocops crimefoiling and vengeance on his murderers  
as a science fiction actionthriller  robocop is extremely effective  
dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense  shocking gore  and spectacular special effects  
several sequences in the film  such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist  are destined to become cultclassics  
because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing  it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audiencein other words  in a movie theater  
although the special effects and action are exciting  they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre  
rather  robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society  
the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative  terrorism  board games  and television news broadcasts with airheaded anchors  
these news broadcasts  which are exceptionally clever  recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore  
the satire in robocop  however  is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood  
s america  as portrayed in the film  may seem far fetched but is in actuality  i think  only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society  
the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd  
verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fictionsocial commentary  
unfortunately  robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre  
the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior  the terminator  and aliens  
robocops main problem  aside from its dumb title  is that it does not sufficiently develop murphys character  
we never learn the degree to which murphy  as robocop  is human and the degree to which he is a robot  
does murphy have any human spirit or free will left  or is he merely a computer following a program  
the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action  
moreover  it almost completely ignores the question  and tragedy  of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine  
robocop also contains several bothersome looseends  
as you watch robocop  you experience deja vu  you feel as if you have seen the film before  
in many respects  robocop is reminiscent of several other films  including the terminator  return of the jedi  and even death wish  
however  to its credit  robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap ripoff
