john von neumann  progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project  pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos  even without recourse to fasterthan light travel  
you send out selfreplicating robot ships which explore and radio back information  
it may take decades  centuries  or millennia  but it can be done with achievable technology  and doesnt require a magical fasterthanlight drive  
in the fifties  british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it  any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer  which would then engage in a realtime dialog with the aliens  exchanging information and technologies  and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned  
about thirtyfive years ago  the bbc contracted with astronomerwriter fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a miniseries called a for andromeda  
afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission  the construction of a huge computer  the computers analysis of life on earth  and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication  
she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the thenunknown julie christie  
audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel  andromeda breakthrough  which played to equally high ratings  
dennis feldman  whose previous credits include the golden child  has never been noted for coherent  wellstructured movie scripts  they start out great  and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action  mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl  
feldman writes good scenes  but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie  even with a previous version to use as a model  
now  in species  we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline  derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter  gore  and chases  
species features ben kingsley  who is completely wasted in a badlywritten portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist  
forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script  
the species story is relatively simple  we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since   and have been receiving answers for two years  
  note that  in the s  we really didnt know diddly about the human genome structure  and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings  
even today  all we can do is give information about dna and how it works  not a copy of human dna  because we dont have it analyzed yet   
the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race  and doctor xavier finch  played by ben kingsley  is placed in charge of the attempt  
the script begins to go off the deep end at this point  when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shapeshift into any of several ugly alien life forms  
the first half of the film has something to offer  as  sil   the alien girl  struggles with her multiform existence  changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again  all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos  
she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society  with glaring gaps where her social skills should be  
her instincts are to mate and procreate  and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area  
escaping from her birth laboratory in utah  sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her  
she goes on an eating binge  spins herself a cocoon  and emerges as an adult  played by natasha henstridge  who goes a long way toward recreating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in   
the pursuers  michael madsen is an assassinexterminator  forrest whitaker is a convenient empathpsychic  just as though the u  s  government actually had such people on call  
neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided  
whitakers role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek  the next generations  counselor cleavage   
the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina  
kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals  too good to not work to the best of their abilities  but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland  and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak  
h  r  gigers design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it  although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly  
the main fault of species is lack of originality  it starts out with a wonderful  albeit borrowed  premise  and then doesnt live up to it  
all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes  with a few monsters tossed in  
there is no buildup of tension and suspense  no climax worthy of the name  species is just a sequence of  scare  scenes stuck together  
the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes  but not rescued by them  
on the other hand  as an exercise in scifi action adventure  it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd  
species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board  but by and large  its fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing  
my personal rating is three stars  but knock one or two of those off if you dont enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters
