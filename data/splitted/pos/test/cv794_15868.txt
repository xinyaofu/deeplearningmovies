  the faculty   the heavilyhyped and advertised scifihorror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez  s  desperado  and s  from dusk till dawn   and screenwriter kevin williamson  s  scream  and s  scream     is being called a cross between  invasion of the body snatchers  and  the breakfast club   and i dont think i could describe it any better than that  
the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common  and then the sciencefiction aspect is added  involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town  
the six characters  as in  the breakfast club   can be easily labeled as a stereotype  but as they are developed  they become far more complex  casey  elijah wood   the much picked upon nerd  stokely  clea duvall   a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her  zeke  josh hartnett   a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz  stan  shawn hatosy   the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics  delilah  jordanna brewster   the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist  and marybeth  laura harris   the sweet n southern new girl in town  
although the characters are only slightly connected  i  e  
casey is delilahs photojournalist assistant  marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely  since they both dont have friends  etc    when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences  the only people they can count on for help is each other  even though they arent really even sure if they can trust one another  
  the faculty  is another smart and popculturally hip film from williamson  although it does not equal up to his best film  the original  scream   and rodriguez  whose  from dusk till dawn  is still one of the more original genre films of the s  
williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions  respectively  that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a nobrainer  
the plotline of  the faculty   involving aliens taking over other peoples bodies  has been done quite a lot before  from  invasion of the body snatchers   to  the puppet masters   to  invaders from mars   so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh  and by setting the goingson at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens  they were mostly successful  
surely  the conventions of the story are still the same  and the climax was inevitable  but there were a few surprises along the way  including the question of who were the aliens  and who werent  
the epilogue was also a refreshing changeofpace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better  
the performances in  the faculty  were a treat throughout  since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do  
one exception were the teens  who  aside from elijah wood  are not very wellknown  but they all aquit themselves nicely  particularly wood  the seasoned pro   clea duvall  and jordanna brewster  
as members of the faculty  robert patrick   t  judgement day   was creepy as the gym coach  piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher  bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien  and salma hayek  as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold  was very funny in a small role  
the standout  in my opinion  of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who  after turning into an alien  becomes the sex bombshell  
if there was any problem i had with the faculty  it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence  
since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the  queen  alien  many of the faculty members disappear  
it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers  although the finale is still pretty impressive  and includes some showstopping creature effects  especially for a relatively low milliondollar budget  
although not one of the best horror or sciencefiction films i have seen   the faculty  is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released  
while the story is as old as the hills  it is also  in a way  timeless  because everyone  i think  has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right  as if they really werent human  
and by putting this idea in the setting of a smalltown high school  it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers  
 note  the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading  as it features r  b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters  
in actuality  he only has a small role as one of stans buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team  
if i were one of the heads from dimension  i would change this advertising at once  since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving
