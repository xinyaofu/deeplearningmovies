contact  pg  theres a moment late in robert zemeckiss contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place  
we see a scientist  dressed in a silvery space suit  walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact  spherical space pod  unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops  
anticipation  excitement  anxiety  fearthe audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character  nervously  breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead  
it is this sense of discovery  the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration  that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical  captivating entertainment  
jodie foster stars as dr  ellie arroway  a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals  
and i mean lifeafter losing her entire family when she was young  the only thing occupying ellies world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth  
after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers  ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega  which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport  
from this synopsis  contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact  but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the scifi hook  
the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe  but perhaps more than anything else  contact is a character study of ellie  whose obsession with empirical  scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power  
the irony is that  while admitting to having no religious faith  she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes  in a sense  a religion in its own right  
it would be easy for scripters james v  hart and michael goldenberg  in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine  to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones  but they wisely eschew easy answers  giving equal time to both sides  and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane  
in the end  there is no right or wrong  nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other  even slightly sothere are just two very viable points of view  each with their own merits  each with their own faults  
the complex role of ellie is an actresss dream  and foster  a virtual shooin for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year  more than rises to the challenge  
she conveys intelligence  determination  warmth  and  in a gutsy move  always on edge  
we root for ellie and feel for her  but we also feel at times that she goes too far  
contact is clearly fosters vehicle  but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles  
matthew mcconaughey  who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role  holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie  spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss  however  his main storyline  the tentative palmerellie romance  is the films weakest subplot   
john hurt is effectively creepy as s  r  
hadden  the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding  
angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine  
most memorable of all  though  are tom skerritt and james woods  who play rival scientist dr  david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz  respectively  both  especially skerritt  embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances  
zemeckis comes off of his threeyear break in top shape  
always known as a director of effectsladen extravaganzas  it comes as no surprise that contacts visual effects are quite stunning  
the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of   a space odyssey  but with more advanced technology at his disposal  zemeckiss voyage is even trippier than stanley kubricks yet more wondrously pure  
and zemeckis doesnt resist the urge to use the alwaysinteresting incorporateactorsintoexistingfilmfootage effect  which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump  
effects  however  are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama  emotion  and pure wonder  which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump  
it says a lot that  in a summer science fiction film such as this  its not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised  
the thoughtprovoking  twohourplus contact is a muchwelcome change of pace from summer nobrainers  but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isnt entertaining  
for all the interesting questions it asks  the film is still what its being sold as  a journey to the heart of the universe   
and what a fascinating  unforgettable journey it is
