bruce willis is a typecasted actor  
in die hard  he played john mcclaine  a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time  
again  in pulp fiction  as butch coolidge  an overthehill boxer  he steps on the wrong guys toes  
in luc bessons the fifth element  willis plays korben dallas  a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time  
a stylish science fiction epic  the fifth elements complex plot begins right away  in the deserts of egypt  think stargate  in   
an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the   elements  are stored and takes them away  vowing to return them when the evil comes back  
cut to present day  which is our future  
the year is   and new york is the city  
the only basic differences between bessons futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker  the buildings are higher  and the traffic floats  
anyway  the  evil  comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth  so back come the tortoiselike aliens to return the   elements  to earth  in order to defend themselves against the  evil   
in the process  however  the ship is intercepted by  fighter pods and is destroyed before landing  
when officials arrive at the site  all that remains is a hand  
what can you do with a hand  
hey  its the st century heredna reconstruction  
this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful  but mysterious woman named leeloo  milla jovovich  dazed and confused   
she escapes and  attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korbens floating cab  
its love at first site  as korben and leeloo elude the lazyasalways cops  
when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius  ian holm  night falls on manhattan   korben searches the  yellow pages  and delivers her to the door of the good reverend  the only man who knows of her background and duties  
now  korben  leeloo  and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship  special effects were spectacular here  to find the remaining four elements  
it is here  where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jeanbaptiste emmanuel zorg  gary oldman  murder in the first   
he  too  wants possession of the elements  as do a group of piglike warriors  think the gamorreans in return of the jedi   
in a spectacular ending  with time running out  leeloo is faced with a problemwhy should she save a people who live to destroy each other  
the question is a good one  and one that could be pondered  
but enough of that  
when korben points out his love for her  leeloo is inclined to become the  th element  and save the world from total destruction  
the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm  an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain  who reminded me a lot of jack nicholsons the joker in batman  by one of the masters of villainy  oldman  and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich  
the supporting cast  which includes brion james  tango  cash   tim  tiny  lester  no holds barred   luke perry  buffy the vampire slayer   and chris tucker  friday   added a comedic effect to the film  
although bessons the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches  it is a solid motion picture with a definite point  
some other directors  like anacondas luis llosa  should take a lesson from this guyusing ideas from epic motion pictures the right way  
ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film  
scifi fan or not  any movielover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture
