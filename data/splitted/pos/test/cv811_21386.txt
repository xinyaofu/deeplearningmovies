note  ordinarily  moviereviews  org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as  spoilers   
however  being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews  org 
feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations  plot giveaways will appear in the following review  
if this bothers you  please note the  star rating of the film and stop reading now  
  what does it take to play carnegie hall  
practice   
it takes two hours for music of the heart to  play carnegie hall   both figuratively and literally  
like the children it portrays  the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a showstopping performance at the legendary concert hall  
roberta guaspari  academy award winner meryl streep  has two kids  a husband who left her and  violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean  
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school  
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors  
that is the patternlike plot of this production  
ultimately  the film chooses a zerosum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an alltime high when the men in her life finally vanish  
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful  
robertas character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat  
also lacking depth is the films  bad guy   a narrowminded music teacher  josh pais  who rejects roberta out of principle  the movie never explains exactly which principle that is  and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around  
the next  minutes of the film are mediocre  
they are highlighted by one childs return to robertas class  coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be cant be around anymore because  my mom said      and a glowing concert  
not knowing the running time  you may expect the credits to role at this point  
but they dont  
instead the film uses the next  minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent  
director wes craven  known for his works of horror  uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing  
one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic  but    
last night     
and robertas two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their fathers absence  
the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie  
robertas mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype  
the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens  predictably one of robertas students is gunned down and killed off screen  
one thing the film does lack is subtlety  
the fact that a little boy was playing  we shall overcome  on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference  
the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience  
  of course  in horror films the foreshadowing and betweentheline moments are meant to be overdone  so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game   
even with all its flaws  music of the heart is a beautiful film  
that is not an excuse for the movies poor beginning  
but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall  i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage  
in december of  a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history  
the performance included a deadon elvis impression  robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies  
so  how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life  
he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience  
perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santas favorite food  this movie has an amazing finale
