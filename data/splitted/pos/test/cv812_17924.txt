seen april    at  p  m  at crossgates cinema   guilderland  n  y    theater   by myself for free using my hoyts critics pass  
theater rating       very good seats  sound and picture 
do you realize that every time you encounter a new person youve just become part of a story  
everyone has their own life story  both past and present  and every time two or more interact  they become part of each others story  not necessarily an important or even significant part  but a part nevertheless   
that seems to be the basic theory behind go   where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  
in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldnt usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them  such as a teenage supermarket cashier  a bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  
these types of characters might not sound all that original  but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father  a midlevel drug dealer  a narc obsessed with multilevelmarketing  horny wedding guests  a zen lovemaker  two shrimpscarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out  
how they will all come together is the process the film deals with  
id imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general  
the film starts out as anything else  with little indication of whats to come  
we meet ronna  polley   a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesnt seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent  
shes not very charming  especially to her customers  but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works  
maybe this is because shes not a very afeminite character  but shes far from masculine  a creative character indeed  
things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy  hyperactive  yet likable simon  askew   an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences  
this agreement starts a threepronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug  
the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death  
nearly the same can be said for two other characters  zack  mohr  and adam  wolf   who we dont think much of when they first appear as supporting characters  but later will become major players to the films makeup  another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be  
once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle  
when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene  its clear this film isnt going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling  
considering how good it is up until that point  its a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today  
and so the film begins to take shape  first by following ronna and her friends on a onenight adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam  who were actually looking for simon   which doesnt exactly go as planned  but thats what keeps it all so interesting  
the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronnas story  but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead  
simon and his three friends head to  vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined  
the third arc  about zack and adam  again overlaps with ronnas story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle  
were shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna  
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam arent even their fault  they just happened to be where they were when they were  
id really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end  but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who havent seen the film  
perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability  and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay  just through great filmmaking  
still  i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well  
  direction  trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman  its a great accomplishment  
he doesnt just depict a story  he wraps us up in it all  pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low  
  screenplay  besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general  its clear the script has been inspired by many sources  with both obvious and subtle references  yet it never screams ripoff   
  tonemood  where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream  this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre  
its not overlydark or twisted and the comedy isnt so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy  more like macabre light   
  cinematographyart direction  able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner  
  characterization  for nearly every character introduced  no matter what role they play in the big picture  were able to get a sense of who they are  what theyre thinking and how they came to be in their situations  
even when their actions are surprising  it never seems very out of synch  
  performances  every actor nails their role  see above   
  themetheory  the film doesnt seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages  instead  its more of a philosophical experiment  
in fact  it might not have meant to do that intentionally  but there definitely is something existential to it all  
    and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure  
    see also  the big lebowski   clerks   jackie brown   pulp fiction   true romance   also by liman  swingers
