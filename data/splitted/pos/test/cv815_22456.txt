youd think it would be easy to spoof star trek  but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it  
thats a bit more difficult  
the farfetched scifi series is  after all  enormously popular  what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies  
if youre not nice to it  you lose  
galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brookss spaceballs was to star wars  an affectionate  riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems meanspirited or malintentioned  
  the shows been cancelled  but the journey is far from over   
that is the current tagline of  galaxy quest   a star trek  type show thats no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns  
it also lives on in conventions  gatherings of the shows obsessive fans who never fail to dress in  galaxy quest  costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble  
jason nesmith  tim allen  played  commander peter quincy taggart  on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do  
the attitudes of the rest  tommy webber  daryl mitchell  gwen demarco  sigourney weaver   fred kwan  tony shalhoub  and alexander dane  alan rickman   range from indifference to utter contempt  
dane  who played a spocklike alien  is especially disgusted  considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his characters cheesy trademark line  by grabthars hammer  you shall be avenged   or something like that  for his diehard fans  
one day  nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of  galaxy quest  followers  
they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia  
they have mistaken the  galaxy quest  episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel  
the next day  the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris  named  in one of the films only meanspirited gags  after village voice film critic andrew sarris   
nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig  and sort of blows it off  but when he is transported  or i should say shot  back to earth in a rather celestial manner  he believes  
next thing the cast knows  they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship  
of course  they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship  what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them  
but after some persuading  they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians  
i was quite surprised how well this comedy  which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign  worked  
taking shots at both the obvious and notsoobvious elements of star trek and its fandom  galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs  opting instead for broad but smart parody  
nothing is safe  not the cliches  not the fans  not the absurd taglines  but on the other hand  everything is safe  since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration  
the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoubs fred a  k  a  tech sergeant chen who  when in character  is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek  
while scotty  who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell  i need more power down here captain    
chens cry for help is more to the tune of  the core  like  wont take it or something   
its a hoot  but it doesnt stop there  weaver  whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman  with his relentlessly holierthanthou attitude arent far behind  
galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while its not a masterpiece  it tends to falter in its more serious moments  it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season  
by grabthars hammer  this is a hell of a movie
