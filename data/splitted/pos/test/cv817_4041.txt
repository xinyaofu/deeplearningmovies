showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven  director  and joe eszterhas  writer  
their last effort  basic instinct  played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock  with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curryspiced tabasco sauce  a dish not to everyones taste  but certainly a wellcrafted movie  
possibly that movies greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage  prior to the movie  during the movie  and after the movie    
and that  after bringing all the plotlines together neatly  it left the viewer with full knowledge of what  would  happen in the characters future  so there was no need to film it  
there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there  but eszterhas found ways to get it all onscreen in two  by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on  and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  
we have attractive  sympathetic  but still highly repellent characters  we have shows for the eyes and the ears  plotlines that play on several levels  we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable  and we have a story of an innocent  who may not be so innocent  whos trying to play straight  trying to improve her station in life  who slips into behaving the way those around her do    
but recovers with a flourish  and quits a winner  
in this sense  the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven  whos not known for treating his characters well  but nomi  the part played by elizabeth berkley  definitely opts out of the game in a positive way  and were left feeling good about her future  
this is not one of the great movies  but its far better than wed been led to expect by all the negative prerelease publicity  
verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in   and in the last quartercentury has pushed farther and farther  experimenting with the sociallyacceptable limits to moviemaking  
his most recent three movies  robocop  total recall  and basic instinct  have been a progression of backdoor access to american culture  moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives  and now hes exploring the sleeze  
this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the directors contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie  
  verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating  although his original version is available on video   
many reviewers have taken the politicallycorrect stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing  but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies  its about people in an environment where naked ladies are common  and why such an environment should exist  
its about the scum who use other people as powertrip toys  and the need to escape their power  
its about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values dont pertain  and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment  
an nc movie which isnt sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty  power  or value  
the one scene in the movie that  could  have been a good sex scene  berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool  is not exciting  because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator  
if anything  its a rape scene with a victim whos been duped into cooperation  
you dont make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors  you dont make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed  and you dont make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls    
and in an awful lot of vegas shows  an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing  
this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry  in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity  
showgirls deglamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness  
nomi is played  in a very good performance  by elizabeth berkley  who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents whos at the end of her rope  desperate to live a life better than the one shes known  
she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability  and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker  trying to be something better than she seems destined to be  
when nomi realizes shes gone too far for too little  she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be  
gina rivera plays molly  a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi  providing her with what may be the one solid  positive relationship in nomis entire life  
molly is the one who makes the difference  and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system shell be using for the rest of her life  and nomis feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomis decision  
gina gershon plays cristal  an aging  but still very attractive starring dancer  a reflexively competitive manipulator whos become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her  
gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch  a fading talent made bitter by selfawareness  
her character is very well drawn and performed  in a major scene in a hospital room  she acknowledges what she is  and  in essence  passes the torch to nomi  
the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie  and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path  
it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe  molly is an honest  hardworking person who means well  and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality  
cristal is a talented dancer whos compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a cooperating part of the system  exchanging selfrespect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas  
nomi believes she can make it without selling herself  succumbs to a degree  and then realizes she can make it without selling herself  and doesnt need las vegas or its brand of  stardom   
the male parts in this movie are simply props  they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist  
kyle maclachlan  whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden  gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs  camouflaged as a nice guy  
glenn plummer plays a dancer whos working as a bellboy  and provides a bit of alternate perspective  
plummers character is the only one in the movie whos maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art  but even hes succumbed to the cult of manipulation  
plummers character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie  
some of jost vacanos cinematography is fantastic  and one particular delineation of nomis character alteration  a nodialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting  is utterly terrifying  
this movie is rated nc due to language  sexual situations  full frontal nudity  violence  and probably the costuming as well  
i dont see a way this particular story could have been told well without it  and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in moviemaking  
but dont go see it if youre not in a tough mood  the only person its possible to like in this movie ends up in an i  c  u  
on life support  and there is probably not one character in this movie youd enjoy meeting in person
