after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction  jackie brown seems like something of a lighthearted departure for quentin tarantino  
its more of a hohum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language  
luckily  his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen  and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer  
the story introduces us to a streetwise black woman named jackie brown  pam grier   a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another  
she works for a bottomofthebarrel airline and receives a minimal salary  
but one day  she is picked up by a pair of federal officials  including michael keaton as the toughnosed ray nicolet   and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope  
jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell  samuel l  jackson   who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation  
soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle    through to them under nicolets nose  with the help of ordells oaf of a partner  robert de niro  and druggedout lady friend  bridget fonda   
also entering the picture is a bailbondsman named max cherry  robert forster   who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated  how i wont say   
the big dropoff is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown  in which numerous doublecrosses take place and many clothing store bags  filled with cash  switch hands  
its unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there  and doesnt offer anything extremely compelling while doing so  
there are  as always  amusing exchanges between characters  
the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda  as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq  or lack thereof  
the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie  
a year old white bail bondsman and a year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry  
youve got to commend the acting  
jackie brown is a seriously draggedout exercise enlivened by such fine acting  
the film clocks in at a lengthy  hours   minutes  
tarantinos talky style manages to hold your attention heavily  but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline  
also  fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear  
jackie brown has four major shootings  and two of those take place mostly offscreen  so dont be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath  
you can expect frequent foul language  mostly coming way of ordell  who  much to the dismay of spike lee  uses the n word as part of his regular vocabulary  
the acting is the glue that holds everything together  
grier  making a sudden comeback from her reign in the s  is more than adequate for the title character  
in fact  shes flatout great  
another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster  who does a grand job as max cherry  and is perfectly cast in doing so  
michael keaton makes his presence felt  albeit in small but dignified moments  and de niro is ideal in playing the lughead who goes over the edge  
speaking of that  bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordells bikiniclad beach babe  and yet she manages to look fairly occupied  
theres not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie  
which is a lifesaver for mr  tarantino  
the story barely holds together in the meantime  and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake  
but oh well  
jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino  even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work  
lets just hope that the director hasnt gone soft on us
