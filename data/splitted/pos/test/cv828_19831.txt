all those who were offended by theres something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie  a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch  
and while this uproariously funny  grossout summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste  it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end  
american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenagetargeted fare this season  
i must question the studio that releases a movie like this  
the producers are aiming these films at the  crowd  but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an rrated film  
some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc  a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie  
american pie was threatened with an nc  but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product  it was given an r  but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park  
it is sick  perverse  and ultimately disgusting  not to mention extremely funny  
american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night  
jim  jason biggs   kevin  thomas ian nicholas   oz  chris klein  and finch  eddie kaye thomas  are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead  
jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base  to which one of his friends replies  like warm apple pie      
of course  this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers  in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner  
there are many moments  such as this  in which director paul weitz uses a gameplan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary  to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief  
american pie is a hardfought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it  
i loved the young cast in this movie  
consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with  obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects  and you should appreciate their performances  
biggs is more than enjoyable  and chris klein  who recently played a similar jock in election  is obviously a young talent on the rise  
but in a teendominated movie  the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy  of televisions sctv   who is unexpectedly brilliant as jims uneasy father  
scenes in which the familiar fatherson conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie  
after levy discovers jims new use for apple pie  he tells him  i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age  
but i never used baked goods   
it is performances such as his  and bill murrays in rushmore  that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out  
there are some lessthanoriginal aspects of the film  
a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of exlax is something weve seen before  
if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers  then this is a decidedly unwise move  the same prank was pulled in the brothers dumb and dumber  and used to greater effect  
secondly  the characters are forced into a halfhearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing  
but at one point  in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of its own  biggs asks his buddies why hes going through so much pressure for something thats not very important anyway   
and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate  it still manages to be mature  
in its own way
