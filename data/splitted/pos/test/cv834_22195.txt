  sometimes the green mile seems sooooo long   
indeed  
and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review  
on a more positive note  let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length  
the mile in question  green due to its faded limecolored linoleum  leads from the prison cell to  old sparky   the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisianas cold mountain penitentiary in   
paul edgecomb  tom hanks  youve got mail  is the head guard of eblock  otherwise known as death row  
keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility  
it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they  talk to  the convicts instead of yelling at them  
this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars  
into his charge comes one john coffey  michael clarke duncan  armageddon   a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls  
immediately  paul senses something different about this prisoner  
perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark  
or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he  takes back  pauls bladder infection thereby restoring him to health  
based on steven kings  serialized novel  the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told  eduard delacroix  michael jeter  patch adams   is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks  percy wetmore  doug hutchison  a time to kill   is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner  fry  up close  and hal moores  james cromwell  babe  pig in the city  is the compassionate warden for whom  despite all the executions hes witnessed  death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor  
while it is mr  hanks  everyman  performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for  minutes  it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting  
all involved do credible work in their respective roles  most especially mr  duncan  who turns in an impressive  fully realized characterization  
if only the story were more credible  
writerdirector frank darabont  the shawshank redemption  has crafted a flawed fantasyallegory of sorts  one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual  relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power  
mr  darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters  
was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed  
by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts presence on eblock  the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out  making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted  
this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched  
much has also been made of coffeys christlike ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures  coffeys powers are shrouded in mystery  taking on the feel of a circus trick  coupled with a voodoolike  i feel your pain  transference  
in contrast  there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god  
the genuine  gifts of healing  listed in  corinthians  is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god  
true spiritual healing  with few exceptions  requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed  
such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism  but from the revealed word of god
