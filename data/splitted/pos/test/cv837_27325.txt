in chocolat  a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures  patterns  and lines  hoping shell be able to foresee the kind of chocolate theyll most enjoy  
some scoff the idea  but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next  revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before  
this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole  on the surface  it appears to be a light  fluffy fable with no depth or true worth  but when one takes a second  deeper look  chocolats true colors begin to shine through  
making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it  lasse hallstroms chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously craftednot to mention one of the best films of the year  
what gives chocolat its magic  much like hallstroms  winner of two academy awards  the cider house rules  is its willingness to say whats on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences  
the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers  but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrowmindedness  
chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet  where majority rules  and the majority lives by only one law  religion  
the bulk of the townspeople  with few exceptions  are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence  lent  but when the independent thinking  seemingly nonreligious vianne rocher  juliette binoche  and her daughter anouk  victoire thivisol  make the village their home  the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouthwatering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens  
many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by viannes opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent  especially the mayor  comte de reynaud  a cartoonlike alfred molina   who will stop at nothing to put her out of business  
on the other hand  the shop is a delight to others  including the cranky armande voizin  judi dench   who sits day by day in viannes shop  telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson  aurelien parentkoening   which comes as a result of his mother  carrieann moss  believing armande is a bad influence  as she does not hold the same  strict religious beliefs that she does  
also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat  whose husband is constantly beating her  to whom vianne offers a home and befriends  
juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne  genuinely capturing her characters determination to turn the narrowminded townspeople into more happy  independent human beings  but most of chocolats success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses  
lena olin  previously nominated for an oscar in   deserves her second nomination for her earnest  moving portrayal of a lost  scared woman torn between staying true to her battering  manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs  
judi dench is sharp  incisive  and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin  
carrie annmoss  in what is likely to be her first largely noticed  and acclaimed  role since the matrix  shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen  crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously  
victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk  a young girl hoping her alwaysonthemove mother will eventually settle down  
a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline   five extraordinary women  one extraordinary movie   
thats not to say the men dont do their share  though  alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist  hugh oconor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is  and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux  who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne  
the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board  lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care  perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film  
cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric  fairy tale look to the film  and rachel portmans masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules  
chocolat  adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel  is a wonderful little treat of a film  one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter  and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter  
while not as powerful as the cider house rules  lasse hallstroms chocolat is a film which works on all levelsas a drama  a comedy  a fable  a romance  and a fairy tale  
and it even lives up to its name  it is delicious to savor the taste of  easy to digest  and  like all excellent chocolate  it is memorable for days afterward  
the bottom line  chocolat is pure pleasure
