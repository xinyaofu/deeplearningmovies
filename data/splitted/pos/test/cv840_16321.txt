the question isnt why has grease been reissued  
the answer to that one is easy  to celebrate the movies th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramounts coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity  
no  the question that ought to be asked is  should grease be reissued  
the answer is not an easy one  
grease is a fun movie  an entertaining fantasy of the s  embodying all the cliches of that era  
the music is lively and the dance numbers  choreographed by patricia birch  are energetic and highspirited  
travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon  cool  but nonthreatening  
but grease didnt break any new cinematic ground  
it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider  
what grease is  or has become  is the highestgrossing musical in film history  
ok  lets not be a spoilsport  
grease is a fun and entertaining movie  even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta  olivia newtonjohn  taxis jeff conaway and the multitalented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers  
its nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was  and its sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career  
he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly  
cinematically  the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur  
between grease and s evita   you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand  
two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre  the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated  no  make that cynical and jaded  
today  if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight  he or she would probably be hooted off the screen  
todays audiences lack the innocence  that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed  
secondly  a lack of talent  
performers with the charisma  the style  the largerthanlife panache of fred astaire  gene kelly  ginger rogers and judy garland are gone  
most singers and dancers remain on the stage  and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts  
a good example is gregory hines  one of the greatest dancers in the world  
he danced a bit in the cotton club  tap and white nights  but those were essentially dramatic vehicles  
so  perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose  
if audiences show enough interest  meaning if the rerelease earns the studio enough revenue  it may spark a revival in movie musicals  
perhaps not original musicals such as singin in the rain  an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers  but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years  
at one time or another  according to the industry rumor mill  hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webbers cats  a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago  the latter reportedly to star madonna  
so  let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals  
let grease be the word that sparks this revival
