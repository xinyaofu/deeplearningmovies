plot  a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side  
but this new guy is not like all the others  hes got ambition  hes got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster  
violence  lots of swearing and betrayals ensue  
critique  a very good  seriousminded  unique british gangster flick which misses the  great  mark by way of an annoying voiceover popping up throughout the film and a soso ending  
heres yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix  
okay  so its not entirely new  but its definitely original when all put together as done here  
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place  
its  and these dudes are looking good  
yes  its all about the suits  fellas    the 
italian shoes  the cufflinks  the ties and the birds  thats ladies  for those uninitiated  hanging around you  
here are a bunch of horrible men  gangsters if you will  looking sharp  talking shit and busting heads all over the place  
but thats not the basis of this movie  
the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group  the excellent david thewlis  and one of his cronies  paul bettany  also extremely good in this film  and how the power  sex appeal and coolness of one  affects the other  
you know how there are always these  hangeron  gangster types who latch on to the godfathers  the leaders  the top dogs of every crime organization  
well  most of the time  these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person    that 
is  their boss  
so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence  
but this film brings the betrayals  the messed up loyalties  the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package  
of course  director paul mcguigan isnt trying to be guy ritchie here  and doesnt overstylize his presentation  jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix  
nope  he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this  
the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which hes attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty  
   look into my eyes    
in fact  the last time that ive seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers millers crossing  
scary shite  
but theres an ever better scene than that in this film  
this one features bettany  once again  slowly torturing  hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster  from that mans pointofview   but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes  one by one  thats right  he  does  the guy in his underwear   
that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film  especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss  why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman    
but the flicks not perfect  
in fact  i didnt mind malcolm mcdowells voiceover narration at first  but as the film grew into a major flashback  most of the film is presented as such   he came in every now and then  and rarely added anything of interest to the plot  
all he seemed to do was swear and call people the cword umpteen times  and even described one scene as it was happening      so 
i opened the door  then went up the lift  etc      its 
like  yeah  i know that already  i could see it on the screen   
overdone    
i also didnt quite  buy  the ending of the movie  which despite being original  seemed a little unbelievable  especially when you consider that its supposed to be taking place  years later  and folks still seem to be holding grudges  still in love  still living in the same apartments     
i mean  cmon    its  years  man   
i dont know  somehow it didnt work all that well for me  
but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies  and this one is a decent addition to the lot  
forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowells narration of the obvious plot points  and concentrate on the films stronger attributes such as its style  the exquisite atmosphere of the time period  its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group  its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads  bettany and thewlis  
incidentally  unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below  this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films    its the real deal  
note  this film is packed with strong accents all around  which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time  
its also quite violent and i dont remember any film that used the cword as much as this one  so leave the kids at home for this one
