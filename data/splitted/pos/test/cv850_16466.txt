buffalo   is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci  
gallo plays a very troubled man  who was sent to jail for gambling  
once out of jail  he must visit his parents  who he told he was married  
the truth is he isnt married  
to try to impress them  he kidnaps a girl  christina ricci  from a tap dancing class to act as his wife  
the film is very cheaply made  and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie  but you dont need money to make a good film  
buffalo   doesnt always stay with the realistic concept  and sometimes goes through outrageous events  
gallos parents  played by angelica huston and ben gazarra  are two very strange individuals  
the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits  
gallo and ricci arrive at his parents house  and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house  
riccis performance during the scene at gallos parents home are very well done  
there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes  
the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative  
they seemed very mediocre  but they worked out just fine  
gallos character is developed very well  
the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear  
gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through  
his character goes through many  many problems  just like many people in real life  
this character seemed very realistic to me  
riccis character is funny and different  
she doesnt care much that she has been kidnaped  in fact  she falls in love the man who kidnaped her  
ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves  
buffalo   isnt all laughs though  
many scenes are very dramatic and depressing  
gallos character was so realistic  he was extremely disturbing  
some scenes are supposed to come off as funny  but they actually seemed sad and real to life  
the film sometimes drags along  not giving much material  
i really would have liked to see gallos parents a lot more  and i would have liked to see the characters developed more  
overall  buffalo   isnt as good as some people put it up to be  
the bottom line a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom
