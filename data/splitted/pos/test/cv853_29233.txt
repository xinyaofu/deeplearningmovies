my summer was recently saved by two very different movies  
on opening night  i saw american pie  and laughed like a moron  
then a few nights later  i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershmans greenfingers even though it didnt feature a trip to band camp  girlongirl action  or seann william scott  
however  i felt just as good leaving american pie  as i did after leaving greenfingers  which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs  clive owen of croupier   
after spending roughly half of his life behind bars  he is transferred to a more lenient facility  edgefield  
the picaresque  rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade  while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges  
at first  briggs doesnt want to be there  
hes used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone  
however  his ailing roommate  fergus  david kelly of waking ned devine   wears briggs down through his benign nature  
the two become friends  with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift  
briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil  and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers  
after the prisons governor  warren clarke  reprimands them  hes awed at what briggs has accomplished  
and hes struck by an idea  briggs  fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prisons grounds  
greenfingers  which is  inspired by actual events   becomes a bit like a sports movie after that  
despite their differences  the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game  in this case a prestigious garden show  
one renegade  in this case  briggs  will prove to have talent  
of course  love will also rear its head  no  not  prison love    
to hershmans credit  he doesnt pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs  like last years lame marijuana comedy saving grace  
i had to keep pinching myself when i didnt see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies  or the men giving highfives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers  
the movie deals with people and scores on that concept  
its wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again  
give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting  
his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freemans last stand in the shawshank redemption  
owens bedside scenes with kelly  who lends the film a human touch  are a marvel to behold  emotionally gripping without being sappy  
written by hershman  greenfingers contains plenty of laughs  
most come courtesy of helen mirren  who shines as the worldclass gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose  natasha little  when she starts dating briggs  
the mother cant believe what hell do if her daughter  burns the sunday roast   
nothing is forced in greenfingers  
the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines  
primrose and briggs relationship takes awkward steps  
even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield  its done for reasons of loyalty  not because the movie requires him to do so  
after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like americas sweethearts and the princess dairies  its an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well
