  through a spyglass  i could see everything   
king louis xvi was beheaded on january     but instead of visualizing this act of regicide  legendary auteur eric rohmers the lady and the duke observes from afar  
consider it a view to a kill made abstract  
a proper british  yes  british  gentlewoman  grace elliott  lucy russell   and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris  where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants  
the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope  often muttering   i dont know    as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air  
what we dont see might not be able to hurt us  
just close your eyes and think of england  
during times of revolution  the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls  discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them  
adapted from elliotts memoirs  journal of my life during the french revolution  rohmers latest artistic tourdeforce may seem far removed from his domestic comedies  tales of the four seasons  etc    a period film set during the most violent changes in french history  
resisting the temptation for grandscale theatrics  much of the lady and the duke is about quiet  decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes  
grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist  a headstrong  snobbish blueblood  one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along  
a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own  graces life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover  the kings hotblooded cousin  prince philipe  duke of orleans  jeanclaude dreyfus   
the times are changing  though  and the gears inch ever closer toward violence  
during the september massacres of   she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the dukes sisterinlaw on a stake  
rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil  old fashioned  almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob  
in doing so  he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not  the face of death  
when grace sees her friends disembodied head on a pole  rohmers attention drifts from the societal change to one womans reaction shot  laden with hot tears  
grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice  sheltering him from the mob  
through her relationship with the duke  she seeks a passport for this one activists escape  
grace doesnt even understand her own actions  and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger   
she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers  ceaseless police monitoring  house searches  even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence  
maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life  her imperious attitude to the servants never changes   she becomes a heroine through circumstance  
the events themselves are intrusions upon her person  her home  and therefore her values  
aristocracy proves a glass house  one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones  
the duke is called to vote on the kings punishment  and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors  talk means nothing in the face of bloody action  or futile inaction   
the episodic structure creates a wobbly  jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution  which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification  
lazy viewers  and critics  may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke  
thats foolery  but brings up the valid criticism that rohmers characters occasionally become didactic  
rohmers imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future  
what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmers use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism  
the actors were filmed against a bluescreen  then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of th century paris  
this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot  a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wideopen streets  
it looks as phony as titanic  but unlike james camerons debacle  the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone  
why  
they arent real  
the very foundation rohmers characters stand upon is false  and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves  in all their insubstantial glory  
screened at the  new york film festival  feature coming soon
