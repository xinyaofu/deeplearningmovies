city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most  thoughtprovoking  moving  and completely unsentimental  
i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant  which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality  
city of angels is a wonderful film  enhanced by interesting and wellrounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years  
its a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story  and avoids most of the cliches were so used to seeing in films like this  
city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders  film wings of desire  
i have yet to see wings of desire  so i am  unfortunately  unable to make a comparison of the two  
i have heard  however  that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways  which makes me glad that this film isnt a ripoff of its source material  
nicolas cage stars as seth  an angel who  like all of his angel counterparts  is present to lead the dying to heaven  or somewhere just like it   
one day  he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr  maggie rice  meg ryan   and his attention is called to her  
the angels can make themselves seen to humans  but they cant experience any of the senses  most importantly  touch   
he shows himself to maggie  and she falls for him  unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status  
seth wants to become human so he can feel her  
thats when he meets nathaniel messinger  dennis franz    former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race   
  as a side note  i found messinger to be the most fascinating character  for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death   
messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human  
seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel  i know  it sounds ridiculous  but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally welldone   after much deliberation  she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel  
this  of course  is when seth decides to take the plunge  literally  from a building  when he wakes up from the fall  he is human  and happy to feel what its like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead  
since i love this film so much  ill make a minor note that it certainly isnt perfect  
although it is original and mesmerizing  it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre  
the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic  though the details are what make the story excellent  and steel has done a great job with them   
the ending  too  could have been more powerful and less predictable  
these elements are minor  though  and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels  
the acting is superb from everyone involved  
this is perhaps my secondfavorite performance from cage  my favorite being the rock   
hes quiet and pensive  and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softlytoned words  
hes perfect for a role like this  and at the same time he reassures us hes not bound by playing the psycho  though he is good at it  as he shows in faceoff   
meg ryan is a powerful  enticing  and appealinglychirpy actress  and her work here is some of her best  
dennis franz  however  steals all of his scenes as the energetic formerangel  
what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation  
director brad silberling is a talented man  and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters  rather than forced sentimentality  
his direction is steady  and he shows this in just about every scene  near the beginning  maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead  
there is no music or elaborate camera work  we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information  
this is the way stories should be told  and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real  
the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do  
cinematographer john seale  the english patient  provides some of the most stunning images ive seen on the big screen  hundreds of blackclad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours  just as an example   
the music  by gabriel yared  also of the english patient   is perfect for this film  its quiet and moody music  but not sentimental    and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely  
the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of  so far  
all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre  
its a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story acrossthe excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously
