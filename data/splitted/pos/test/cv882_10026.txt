airplane  is considered among many to be the epitome of satire filmmaking  
after all  its brought to us by one of the best known satire writingdirecting teams  
even if most people dont recognize the names behind the films  they are bound to recognize the titles  airplane   top secret  the naked gun  and hot shots to name a few  
but although the zuckerabrahamszucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in   airplane  
remains the true cornerstone of their work  and their directorial debuts  
in the seventies  disaster films seemed to be at an all time high  
films like earthquake  the towering inferno  and the poseidon adventure were big hits  
there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane  a series that spanned the entire decade  
and so  in   we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film  
this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean  
  
  
it had to do with bad fish  
airplane  is the story of ted striker  robert hays   an exfighterpilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six  er  seven comrades  
unable to stop living in the past  teds world fell apart  
he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job  and eventually  as we begin this film  is getting dumped by his lover  flight attendant elaine dickinson  julie hagerty   
in a desperate attempt not to lose her  ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working  
unfortunately  she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her  which leaves him wallowing in selfpity  
in the midst of it all  something happens  
someone gets sick  
then another  
then another  
soon  the whole plane is full of deathlyill chicagobound people  
  
  
and when the pilots get sick  played by peter graves  kareem abduljabbar  and frank ashmore   who will save the day  
  gee  i wonder  
of course the main draw here is the nonstop  whizbang  comedy  with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags  
although i had seen this movie a few times before  i was still laughing thru the entire thing  
the most fun character by far is the doctor  played by leslie nielsen  
hes a dry  subtle  sterotypically straightfaced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film  
in a film like this  youre not really expecting an elaborate production  so one cant complain about the amateurish quality  
what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny  played by stephen stucker  
this character is pointless  nauseating  and very unfunny  
i dont know why he was put in there  and i dont think anybody will find a good excuse  
and when the film nears an end  it slows down quite a bit  almost getting old  
you gotta give it to a movie that only runs  minutes and can feel two hours long  
aside from that  airplane  
is really a topnotch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic  
it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends  especially if they havent seen it  
and if they ask what the plot is  just tell em  its a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film  but thats not important right now   
if youve seen the film  youll understand
