when jim henson passed away  he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success  it now seems  hinged on his input  
jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially  but as the last two muppet films  or that silly computergenerated monkey from lost in space  demonstrate  the thrill and genius are gone  
im not sure the dark crystal  made today  would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awefilled response  
an allpowerful crystal has cracked  causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings  the big  gentle mystics  and the vulturelike skeksis  
the mystics send jen  a naive gelfling boy  on a mission to find the shard that cracked away  which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers  before the great  conjunction  of three suns  
along the way  jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive  the rebecca demornaylike kira  an ogrewitch named aughra  who removes her eyes to look at things  and a spasticbutfriendly  tumbleweedlike animal named fizzgig  
much of the beauty in the dark crystal  which is a simple tale  though it does not condescend to any viewer   lies in its art direction and creature design  
the puppeteering is phenomenalobserve the scenes in which jen plays his flute  or the landwalker chasebut i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture  a delicatelynarrated  by john baddeley   absorbing prologue  
the voice work in the film  by muppet regulars and irregulars  is toneperfect  
as well  trevor jones score should not be discounted  it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character  
i suppose  due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature  that it couldnt be helped  but i wish the film was longer  
jen and kira have wonderful    well  
chemistry  and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated  
the dark crystal has a very small cult following  
the weaker labyrinth is probably betterknown  which is upsetting  
a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinths creatures due to the financial failure of peopleless the dark crystal  
that film never quite found its footing  it played like an acidtrip episode of  the muppet show  with david bowie as guesthost  borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkiens fanbase  
  i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public   
the dark crystal deserved  and still deserves  a bigger audience  
its the best kind of childrens entertainment  elegant  fantastical  and courageously unhip  
brian henson  fortunate son  keep looking back at this  your fathers masterpiece
