the laserman  somehow the title of writerdirectorproducer peter wangs film conjures up images of superheroes  like ultraman and spiderman  
you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips  
as it turns out  the laserman is about crime and about laser beams  but there arent any superheroes  
instead  wangs film is populated by a group of refreshingly offbeat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot  new york city  
the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity  eccentricity  and electricity  
the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss  marc hayashi   a chineseamerican laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment  
he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds  
arthurs professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas  
his personal life  on the other hand  is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives  
in fact  arthur is by far the blandest character in the film  despite a charismatic performance by hayashi  the san franciscobased actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii   
its the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark  
arthurs notsotypical jewish mother  ruth  for example  is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body  
she has dyed her red hair black  she takes herbal medicine daily  and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies  such as matzo balls in soy saucethe ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine  
veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it  almost stealing the movie in the process  
she plays ruth as a driven woman  determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture  
arthurs girlfriend janet  maryann urbano  is a kooky freespirit who would rather meditate than copulate  her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation  
arthurs best friend  joey  tony leung   is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns  
joey is married to arthurs jewish sister  but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house  
arthurs yearold son  jimmy  played by the amazingly adorable david chan  ishorror of horrorsbad at math  
he finds it impossible to meet his fathers lofty expectations  
the various people in arthurs life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity  
like wangs earlier film  a great wall  about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china   the laserman revolves around cultural differences  
every character in the film is  in some way or another  trying to find his identitystruggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way  
the movie also offers a provocative look at technology  
wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu  a detective who is fed up with machines  even though he relies on them to do his job  
the film views technology with a wary eye  acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers  
wang raises the timehonored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions  
was einstein responsible for the abomb  
is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers  
the movie pits spirituality against technology  man against machine  and the result is a draw  
according to the film  technology has its place  but we must employ it with great forethought and caution  
ironically  by its very nature  the laserman is a triumph of technologythe technology of filmmaking  
wangs direction is exquisite  especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically crosscuts between the various subplots  perhaps in homage to d  w  
griffith  
cinematographer ernest dickerson  who has worked on all of spike lees films  gives the laserman a distinctive  artistic look  
mason darings score  which includes a sendup of bach  is right on target  
the laserman is an ambitious endeavor  which is to be applauded  but its sometimes ambitious to a fault  
wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that its hard to digest them all  
for instance  one character  arthurs sister  has negligible screen time  and consequently we just dont care about her marital problems  
in weaving his web  wang has included a few too many strands  
overall  however  the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction  
on the surface  the film is a light and bouncy comedythriller  overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style  
the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film  
you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town
