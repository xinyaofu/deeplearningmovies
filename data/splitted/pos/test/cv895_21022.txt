the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam  
  fitting  since the mediasaturated gulf war became a pop entertainment   
while driving through a long  flat iraqi desert  in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament   one of the men under special forces sgt  
maj  archie gates  whos steering  command requests a beach boys tune  
these men want their apocalypse now moment  only instead of surfing  they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle  armed with automatic rifles  
our three kings  okay  four  are good fighters  but they dont necessarily take operation desert storm seriouslyits a reprieve from their hellish day jobs  
they are gates  new father sgt  
troy barlow  wahlberg   sgt  
chief elgin  cube   and pvt  
conrad vig  music video director jonze   
at storys start  president bush has declared a ceasefire  and american troops are tying up loose ends  
barlow  elgin  and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an  assmap  that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion  
gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation  he proposesdemandsthat barlow  elgin  and vig join him on a treasure hunt  
ditching his escort  a relentless reporter named adriana cruz  nora dunn   is easy  
so is finding the treasure  until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq  saddams men are threatening the dictators detractors  citizens of his own country  with violence  
when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck  ready to loot  the unarmed rebels want help  
  bush encouraged them to rise up against the government  but provided no military support for such cause   
gates convinces the vaults guards that this is a postwar mission  and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck  
the situation could go off without a hitch  the former enemies bear no grudges  
but the money hungry gates has a conscience  and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene  he orders barlow  elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces  
the result  barlow is kidnapped  and the filmmakers imply that these wouldbe kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime  
barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device  
his interrogator lost his family to the bombs  and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child  
  he does  in chilling  lasting images   
i liked these scenes best  because the political became personal  
its one thing to champion the plight of thousands  its another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib  
russell has shocked us before  his first film  spanking the monkey  is about a young mans affair with his bedridden mother  
  its great   
his second  flirting with disaster  features a character who has an armpit fetish  
one could argue that its easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions  though  russell disturbs us in three kings by being nononsense about the violence  
when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home  russell mutes the soundwere paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast  
three kings is russells first visually arresting picture  
stylistically  it stands apart from other war dramas  
newton thomas sigels cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy  which is  of course  entirely appropriate  
one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen  
  a friend enthusiastically added   its like having sand in your eyes    
this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade  
  three kings was shot in arizona  california  and mexico   
russell throws plenty at sigels camera for it to observeas was the case with russells previous efforts  the most absurd moments are also the films most realistic  even the most poignant  
  we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside   
if anything  three kings settles down and stops surprising us  
its climax is pure hollywood  no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indieminded russell  
subsequently  the characters become more cartoonishbarlows posttorture revelry felt phony  and chief  a strong presence in the first third  fails to escape the godfearingultraseriousantiracistblackmanofpower clich  so much for cube avoiding token status  
  the arab players  on the other hand  duck stereotype   
clooney  too  transforms into a blandly heroic protestormarching with the rebels  i waited for him to shout   let my people go   
hayseed vig notwithstanding  the protagonists are very intelligent  and selfserving  too  i had a glimmer of hope  based on russells filmography  that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture  
  its not spoiling much to write that   
then again  what historical importance would such nastiness serve  
  theres already enough cynicism in the films mentioning of kuwaits oilinfested waters   
russell offers the masses a primer on the oftdismissed gulf conflict  and pulled off a neat trick  a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared  
if he set out to make something sociallyculturallypoliticallyglobally significant  he succeeded  
with flair
