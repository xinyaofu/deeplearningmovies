the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ  which explains why the bards materials are such a popular source for remakes  revisions  rewrites  inspiration  subtlety  credit  and dispute  
indeed  in recent years  american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products  
including this years upcoming a midsummer nights dream  shakespeares material has been the cause for twentysix big screen productions since   
but for a change of pace  mrs  
brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love  
marc norman and tom stoppards story is largely fantasy  although as the viewer soon learns  shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously  
  will shakespeare of the s wouldve been married to anne hathaway  and he wouldve had a teenage daughter and two young sons  here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes   will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play  and his current comedy in the works   romeo and ethel  the pirates daughter   just doesnt quite seem right  
with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe  rupert everett   and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps  gwyneth paltrow   he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies   romeo and juliet   
the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet  to great effect  
fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum  this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy  
the supporting roles are well filled out  from geoffrey rush as wills worrisome agent  philip  to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman  
even ben affleck  leading the troupe of actors  manages to make a favorable impression  and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i  gwyneth paltrow is by far  however  the standout of the lot  creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance  
the story is wellcrafted if nothing else  although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the  lets make a movie  genre  
the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted  and certainly accessible by the audiences lowest common denominator  
theres something for everyone in this romantic comedy  making it prime date flick material  
although certainly not inspiring in any regard  it revels in a wholesome  wellrounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of s pictures  the truelove story is one of the best around  
certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent yearsopen releases is just around the corner
