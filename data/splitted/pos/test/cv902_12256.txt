james tobacks return to directing after a eightyear layoff  two girls and a guy  is a film which is comprised  more or less  of just that  one guy  blake  robert downey jr    two girls  carla  heather graham  and lou  natasha gregson wagner   one primary setting  blakes absurdly spacious bachelor apartment   and a great deal of dialogue  
embracing a near realtime approach  this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr  toback for his bantering characters  
fortunately  the films cast is up to the challenge  and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters  while admittedly variable  are occasionally wickedly amusing  
the films setup is fairly generic in nature  and opens rather unpromisingly  
we meet selfpossessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou  both waiting outside a soho loft  
as they engage in idle chatter  it is revealed that theyre both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport  and it doesnt take long for them to come to the realisation that theyre being twotimed by the same guy  
more indignant with him than catty with each other  the duo break into blakes loft and await his arrival for a confrontation  
its when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride  
played with magnificent bombast by mr  downey jr   blake is a cad  all right  but a captivatingly dynamic  blusterous  and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights  
its fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat  and perhaps the films best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return  allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others  but by his own innate behaviour  
whether hes flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi  or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds  carla  lou  and his unseen sickly mother   its never less than wildly entertaining and insightful  
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a oneman show  a typical afternoon in the life of blake  if you will  carla  and then lou  reveal themselves  and the sparks begin to fly  
  one of the great touches in the film is how blake  when startled by carlas unannounced appearance  begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cats out of the bag   
doubleteamed by the understandably aggrieved women  who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful  they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy   an increasinglyflustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even selfrighteous declarations against their verbal jabs  
surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters  two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was offlimits for this film  
however  itd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lous outrage to full featurelength  and its as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel  
the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever  the films tempo loses its liveliness  the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion  and several sequences fall flat  
subtle and notquitesubtle allusions are made  a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall   and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale  
one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla  
two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter  longrunning dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene  contractuallyobligated to deliver an rrated film  mr  toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaleddown versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an r  and while admittedly titillating  the net effect of the vignette on the films thematic narrative is rather dubious  
if anything  two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr  downey jr   whose versatility is put to the test in this film  
he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled  from selfassured to disconcerted  yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered  
its a wonderful performance in a role customtailored for him  mr  toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr  downey jr  was arrested on drug charges  and its hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character  in a monologue to his mirrored reflection  blakes selfchiding to  get his shit together  is disquieting in its resonance  
while mr  downey jr  s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film  both actresses are solid in more broadlyobserved roles  
ms  graham is quickly becoming one of americas more daring actresses  involving herself in three successive risky projects  two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank  while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman  
shes quite appealing here  playing a character at once both dainty and sultry  
meanwhile  ms  gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying  or  like me  endearing  
she tones it down substantially as the film progresses  but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox  
the film was reportedly shot in eleven days  filmed mostly in sequence  and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout  
two girls and a guy has an agile  spontaneous sort of feel  and one senses that mr  toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors  
while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact  it doesnt feel constricted  the expansive apartment setting is wellused to vary the background  and mr  toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner  
two girls and a guy falls short of its potential  but thanks to some stellar work by mr  downey jr   its still often an enjoyable  bitingly funny romp  particularly as we watch the surprisinglyresilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends  
  im an actor   he tells them at one point  using the ol triedandtested occupationalhazard defense  
  actors lie   
but not  they all seem to agree  denzel washington
