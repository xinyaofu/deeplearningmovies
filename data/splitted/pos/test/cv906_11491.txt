niagara niagara  r  bob gosses niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of youngloversontheroad movies  
wild marcy  robin tunney  and calm seth  henry thomas  meet cute  literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store  
a mere couple of scenes later  the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small  unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants  
along the way  true love inevitably blossoms  
what sets niagara niagara apart  though  is that marcy is afflicted with tourettes syndrome  a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics  
tunney  displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft  delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last years venice film festival  
to term her work a tourdeforce is not to imply that she attacks the scenery  tunneys effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability  which makes her depiction of marcys illnesswhich often causes her to act violentlythat much more convincing and tragic  
she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly offkilter chemistry  
their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way  mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss  
a detour involving a kindly widower  michael parks  who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt  and the key character of a triggerhappy pharmacist  stephen lang  is highly unbelievable  
but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunneys bravura turn  which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved
