review peter jacksons the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie  and still coming in at the extremely cheap  million price tag  
but for those who were dismayed by this years blockbusters like twister and independence day  the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects  
and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily  
the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a highprofile movie can get  
michael j  fox stars as frank bannister  a con artist who can speak to ghosts  
he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people  then he comes and pretends to get rid of them  
this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash  years ago  
franks latest customers are a young couple  played by trini alvarado and peter dobson  
when dobson ends up dead  alvarado starts to take an interest in fox  
but dobsons spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive hes dead  
this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado  with dobson tagging along as a ghost  
things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town  
fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims  but noone else can see that  
so when fox shows up to try and save each victim  naturally people suspect he is the killer  
fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collectors hit list  and the last half hour of the movie deals with foxs attempts to save her from this evil spirit  
there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh  
the movie starts off as a black comedy  and ends up a horroraction film  
the mix between these genres are perfect  
no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror  and vice versa  
one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman  
but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form  
michael j  fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wifes death  and then is forced to confront this later on  
alvarado  looking like andie macdowell  makes a great frightened  tough  and smart heroine  
and jeffery combs  as a paranoid fbi agent  is brilliantly bizaare  
the frighteners never once feels like it is running long  
the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year  and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters  
this movie is probably what casper wouldve looked like if david lynch directed it  
its easily the best film of the year  so far
