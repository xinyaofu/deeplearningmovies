before you read my review  you gotta know that i love woody allen  
this is a very important note because allens films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone  
i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius  while others see him as a dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again  
i love most of his films  but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the s  
in fact  why he felt the need to make  movies in those  years is beyond me  
if you look at the quality of those films  youll hear what im saying  
the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives  
in fact  i secretly hoped that he would take some  time off  at the turn of the millennium  just to reenergize or something  but it doesnt appear as though he has any intention of doing that  
so here i am again  reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old  
plot  the year is  and woody allen is a topnotch insurance investigator  
his methods are very oldfashioned and apparently out of date  
a new employee  hunt  has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency  
the two do not like each other  
one night  they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician  and unbeknownst to them  placed under his control  
soon thereafter  jewels are stolen  words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer  
critique  a wonderful recreation of the s style movies  with the fasttalking witty banter between coworkers  a catchy jazz score moving things along  film noirish elements such as the veronica laketype sexpot  oneliners galore and a fluffy  if inconsequential plotline  
on the downside  the film actually starts off pretty slowly  with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there  but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy  
the sets  on the other hand  were amazing  the production design and costumes were perfect  and the casting ideal  so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man  
but it wasnt not long before i was fully engaged by the characters  entertained by the many zingers delivered backandforth between allen and hunt  and actually interested in the resolution of the flick  
i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old  parody and actual reinvention  note therons entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool   
of course  films like this  with little or no real tension in the plot  need solid actors to keep you interested in the quickfire dialogue  and once again  allen does a great job in playing his character  who for once  isnt his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude  
he actually plays a  macho  guy here and handles it pretty well  especially the scenes in which hes hypnotized  
but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt  an actress who i was openly  sick of seeing  in movies late last year  sorry babe  you were just in too many at the same time    
anyway  shes really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men  and doesnt miss a beat of allens fastpaced dialogue  
i didnt care much for her running joke about him  dying  whenever he left a room  but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did    yum  
yum  
harumph  but i digress  
so lets recap  
a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score  some funny oneliners  especially in the second half  a decent plotline  although you shouldnt expect a real mystery or anything  and some solid acting all around  
i cant say that this is even remotely close to any of allens best work  but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction  especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through  
its probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else  but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute   oldschool  kind of vibe  with chemistry between the leads  zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion  
little known facts about this film and its stars  annie hall     celebrity     everyone says i love you     husbands and wives     mighty aphrodite     small time crooks     when harry met sally     youve got mail
