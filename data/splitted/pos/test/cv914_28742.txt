susan grangers review of  legally blonde   m  g  m   
its a  pretty in pink    clueless  comingofage story for the new millennium as elle woods  reese witherspoon   a perky southern california sorority queen  switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend  matthew davis   
the girlpower story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says   if im going to be a senator by the time im     i 
need to marry a jackie  not a marilyn   
determined to prove shes as smart a snobby brunette  selma blair  from countryclub connecticut  elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in  much to the amazement of family  friends and faculty  
once there  this flaxenhaired fishoutofwater not only survives but tenaciously thrives  befriending a local manicurist  jennifer coolidge   dazzling a professor  victor garber  and rescuing a defendant  ali larter  in a celebrated boston murder trial  plus finding a more worthy beau  luke wilson   
in the tradition of teencomedy filmmaker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling  theres wit  cheerfulness  a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problemsolving  
firsttime feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon whos joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith  based on a soontobepublished novel by amanda brown  
the supporting cast is terrific  particularly raquel welch and holland taylor  and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink  her signature color on the granger movie gauge of  to    legally blonde  is a frivolous  funny  feelgood   
filled with ditzy blonde ambition  its a movie for highschool kids that their parents would be happy to have them see
