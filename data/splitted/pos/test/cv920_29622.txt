in zoolander  the worlds most successful  influential and intellectuallychallenged male model derek zoolander wonders   is there more to life than being really really really good looking   
obviously  the films creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a featurelength movie out of his hilarious vhvogue fashion awards shortfilm subject  can there be more to this film than being really really really silly  
no  of course not  and it never aspires to be anything more  
much like derek  zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie  
its not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy  and it never produces any gutbusting laughs  except maybe a scene when dereks model roommates all die in a tragic  gasoline fight  accident  a riotously funny takeoff of tommy hilfiger ads   
but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles  wild characters and performances  and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused  
better yet  this exaggerated version of the original threeminute skit is only blown out to an efficient  minutes  just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag  
zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia  since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs  
fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu  will ferrell  drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed  
enter derek  whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel  owen wilson  takes the spotlight  
on the trail of mugatus plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries  stillers reallife wife christine taylor   and shes hoping to use mugatus pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme  
much like the austin powers films  zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved  and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today  
wilson is hysterical as the young  vain hansel  
ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant  freakish mugatu in the same way dr  evil upstages everyone in austin powers  
jerry stiller  bens dad whos best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld  makes a priceless turn as dereks slimy agent maury ballstein  
even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged  largeassed masseuse  
as for ben stiller  it seems his derek has one gag  hes stupid  which plays out in some uproarious oneliners  
unfortunately  taylor seems out of place and out of her league here  
maybe its just because i cant stop seeing her as marcia brady  who she played in both brady movies   making her unbelievable as a dowdy  brainy plain jane who hasnt had sex in two years  
she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo  who wouldve added real comic substance to the flimsy role  
while zoolander is hardly highbrow  its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times  especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days  
zoolanders no masterpiece  but a very worthy distraction
