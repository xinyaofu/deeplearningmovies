tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently  
the dalai lama has made speaking tours  tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops  the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months  
  kundun    presence   a name the monks call the young dalai lama  opens in  with the search for the th incarnation of the tibetan leader  
a group of monks enters a village and a twoyearold child catches their attention  
the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as  mine   
he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country  
he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in   
the peaceful and isolated country is illequipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results  
eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india  
comparisons to  seven years in tibet  are inevitable  
both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerners point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt  
  kundun  features only native actors and is more of an insiders story  
in some ways  this makes this film a superior concept  but it lacks the movement and spark that made  seven years  such an audiencepleaser  
the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie  filmed in morocco for obvious reasons   
the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computergenerated character  
on an intellectual level  it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts  
some events are depicted differently and pitts austrian mountainclimber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lamas life isnt even mentioned here  
glossed over in  seven years   the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses  we were just about to change things  after the chinese attack  
the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins  
his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail  
especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain  
the visual treats more than make up for the movies faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience  
walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience  
martin scorsese  known for his dark tales of the underworld   goodfellas    taxi driver    casino   has shifted gears  
something of a thematic followup to his  the last temptation of christ   this is his slowest film yet  
oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese  most of these events take place offscreen  
his decision to not overexplain rituals is commendable  
the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoonfed interpretations  
philip glasss score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting  
i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again  
hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india  i was struck by what was missing in the movie  
as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is  there is a distance between the audience and the movie  
the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings  
with the exception of a few scenes  involvement with the characters is slight  
one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama  shown as a mischievous boy who cant resist being a kid sometimes  
an encounter with his older brother thubten j  norbu  a retired indiana university professor  who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment  but there arent many of these  
even with its problems  the  kundun  experience is phenomenal  but one that i fear most will miss  
many people who saw  seven years in tibet  will have a  been there  done that  attitude  
its likely that the film will miss a widespread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping
