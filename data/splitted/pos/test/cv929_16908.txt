one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made   seen  is just a few steps away from brilliance  
however  those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  
the film received mixed reviews upon release  but theres an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  
at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing  but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent  
the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  
this piece of work is  intensity  
its uncomfortable to watch  yet compelling  
  i want not to look  yet i cannot turn away   
the story creeps along slowly and deliberately  crafted by visionary director david fincher  
he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions  but not giving away too much too soon  
this is the guy who directed the ominous  alien    
  seen  is even more ominous because the threat is real  
its human and  while the script takes some artistic licence  the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  
that is  if a human being could be so intelligent  patient  wealthy  and disillusioned  
after the most bizarre opening credits ive ever seen  refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment   the initial character development takes place  
morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset  a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  
brad pitt costars as detective david mills  the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  
these two fine actors give the film its human qualities  along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow  who plays tracy  mills wife   
however  none of them stands out above the material  
no disrespect intended  but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  
an ironic note is that somerset has only a week  or   thats seven  days  left on the force to train his young protege  
the title of the picture also refers to the  deadly sins  as chronicled by john milton in  paradise lost  gluttony  greed  sloth  lust  pride  envy   wrath  
incidentally  i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found  
its the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking  but i wont give that away  
as i said  this has a great ending and no one should spoil it  
anyway  the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the  sinners  suffer for it  
the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man  
they learn that he was murderedforced to eat himself to death  
the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and  of course  somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way  
if they didnt  it would be one short movie  
the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story  
we see a lot of blood  but its not especially violent  
the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in  pulp fiction   
  seen  is gory  graphic  and disturbing  but all the gore is postdeath  
still  if you tend to get queasy  dont eat food during this film  
kevin spacey plays john doe  the avenging angel who claims that hes the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings  
like many crazy men  he has some fine ideas  but some sick ways of expressing himself  
spacey doesnt appear until the final  minutes and also doesnt receive billing in the opening credits  
however  its his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination  
a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not  
this character is so well written that its hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone  
no serial killer has ever been so creative  
  seen  is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and its often a little too depressing  
what it lacks in those areas  it makes up for with believable dialogue  topnotch screenwriting  unexpected twists  and realistic characters  
the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive  
fincher uses lighting  music  and editing quite well  but his story is always the thrust of the film  
fortunately  we dont find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits  which are run backwards up the screen    
its better to imagine what paths they will follow  
this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget  
its got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world arent going to cure themselves  
  seen  raises some tough questions and its intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves  
useless triviacostars in s  seen   brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the  best supporting actor oscarpitt in   monkeys   spacey in  the usual suspects   for which he won
