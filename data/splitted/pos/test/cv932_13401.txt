armageddon  in itself  symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking  
stories have been replaced with special effects  character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue  plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up  
armageddon is as stupid  as loud and as shallow as any movie youll see come out this summer  or maybe even any other summer  
but i loved every freaking minute of it  
believe me  im just as shocked as you are  
hell  i dont even know why i went to see it in the first place  
the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year  or at least in the running  
im sorry  but  somebody dial      
isnt quite the tagging thats going to sell a movie  
it isnt too wise either to market the film using the movies stupidest lines   beam me up scotty   yeah  that sure is great writing      
i mean  lets face it  armageddons previews rival the truman shows as being some of the worst of the year  
neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice  
of course  you all know the story  
when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas  nasa calls in the uss top oil drillers    to go into space    and implant a nuclear device eighthundred and someodd feet into the asteroid     
in the coarse of all this mayhem  we are introduced to some interesting  and not so interesting  characters  
belonging to the former group is rockhound  steve buscemi   a horny little womanizing genius whos always full of wisecracks  even when flying into space at a huge amount of gs  
also  theres the always coolashell billy bob thornton as dan truman  the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers  
he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo   only without the intensity and great lines to deliver  
then on the flip side of the coin is the tired  contrived character of harry stamper  bruce willis  who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i cant quite place   the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie  
basically  thats about it  
as i said  this is hardly a film about plot  
its another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden  
case in point  nasa doesnt know that there is even an asteroid on its way until eighteen days before impact  huh  
another example  at one point in the movie  two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy  
how pretentious is that       
want another one  
okay  before the oil drillers blast off into space  one of them starts singing  leaving on a jet plane   and soon  all the rest join in  
did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture  
but naturally  all this sappiness  melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin time at the movies  
and dont get me wrong  despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon  i still very much enjoyed it  
so even if you dont win one of mcdonalds free tickets  its still definitely worth checking out
