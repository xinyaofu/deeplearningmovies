if you thought baz luhrmanns radical take on williamshakespearesromeojuliet was wild  wait until what you see what tony awardwinning stage director julie taymor  thelionking  thebroadwaymusical  does to the bards titusandronicus for her audaciousand very bloodyfilm debut  
while luhrmann transplanted the starcrossed lovers to s florida  taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in romebut places it in a surreal temporal limbo  
the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome  but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the s  while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more s and s  and other garments are more gladiatorlike  
as tamora  queen of goths  jessica lange  exacts revenge on roman general titus  anthony hopkins  for killing her eldest son  and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits  taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the storys underlying themes  
however  the time convergence approach only works at times  for often its just distracting  as in one scene where tamoras suviving sons  matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers  blow off steam playing video arcade games  
taymor didnt have to resort to such avant garde time tricks  for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them  
she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist  the latter compliment encompassing all areas  makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments  
she also has a sure way with actors  hopkins titus is at once tragic and horrifying  and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora  
the clear standout of the cast  however  is harry lennix as aaron  a moor who is tamoras secret lover and a schemer in his own right  
lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain  
a great villain he indeed is  but to leave it at that isnt giving full justice to his powerful and multidimensional work  
titus isnt a complete success  but it is never less than fascinating  and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice
