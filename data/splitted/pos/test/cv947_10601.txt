the premise is simple  if not bizarre  
a mad scientist  trace beaulieu as dr  clayton forrester  launches an averagejoe  michael j  nelson as mike nelson  into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made  
why  
its torturous  its maniacal  and its just plain fun  
based on the cultfavorite cable television series  mystery science theater   the movie isnt torturous  but as for being maniacal and just plain fun  it foots the bill quite nicely  
mike nelson  on a dogbone shaped spacecraft  spends his days as any young man would dream  indulging in sarcasm and horseplay  and seeing quite a few movies  
the catch is  these movies arent the movies he chooses  but retched examples of filmmaking chosen specifically by dr  forrester in an attempt to break mikes will to live  
dr  forrester is convinced that one too many b movies is all it will take to ruin a man  but with a couple of wisecracking puppet buddies  tom servo  voiced by kevin murphy  and crow t  robot  voiced by beaulieu   the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema  
the purpose behind mstk is to exploit some of the worst films known  even if by very few of us  to man  
we watch as the silhouettes of mike  tom  and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them  
in this case  its the  scifi film this island earth  
we basically watch as our three leads watch  only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary  
the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant  but for the sake of those who might want to know  ill explain this one  
this island earth is the tale of two scientists  a man and a woman  who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth  
together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet  
to make mstk work  the filmwithinthefilm naturally has to be as horrible as possible  and although the tvseries introduced us to several worse films than this island earth  its a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty  
mstk  which doesnt actually contain the complete this island earth  is a short  minutes  but this is a step very wisely taken  
as funny as some of their observations are  it can only go so long  
occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously  
although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment  its better than overkilling the whole concept post haste  
mstk lovers will likely hail the film greatly  but if you dont know what youre in for  it could be a jarring disappointment  
although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars  it is a movie to be seen on home video  late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway  and with a large  saracastic crowd  new years at midnight for example  which is when i saw it  
warning  although mstk has more to its end credits than most  the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun   they are actually more annoying than most  
the name slandering and asinine oneliners were extremely unfunny  and after laughing for about  minutes straight  it put a heavy damper on the overall experience  
most people will likely stay to see what the smartalecs have to say  but for me  it almost ruined an otherwise good film
