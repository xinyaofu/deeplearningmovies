steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back  he spent this time writing essays and short stories for  the new yorker   several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation  pure drivel     
much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery  although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview  in a fine chapter called  in search of the wily filipino   
now  as writer and star of bowfinger  he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema  perhaps finally venting the frustrations  everything being made now is crap  that led to his brief retirement from hollywood  
martin stars as bobby bowfinger  a roger cormanwannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer  quality of the projects be damned  
his accountant  adam aleximalle  proposes a movie called  chubby rain   about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops  
bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately  and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film  based on the lie that americas top box office draw  kit ramsey  murphy   has agreed to star  
ramsey  of course  wants nothing to do with such lowgrade material  so bowfinger  on the thinking that action stars need to run  not speak  decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously  
he sends his cast members  who arent in on it  either  they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his costars  to ramseys table at restaurants  asks them to follow him in parking lots  etc   spouting script dialogue  all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance  
the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time  
ramsey is a member of mind head  a cultish selfhelp organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities  
  as if thats not familiar enough  mind head guru terry stricter  terence stamp  has been dressed and combed to resemble l  ron hubbard  founder of scientology   
when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble  white code  in his face  they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat  requiring bowfinger to find a standin  
murphy will probably win more fans as jiff  ramseys adorable  ignoramus double  than as kit  but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage  
always surrounded by an entourage  suffering from a racial inferiority complex  murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself  
furthermore  consider the enemies hell make of popular scientologists  
pacing stricters neutralcoloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer  ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly  
murphys scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta  clearing   
not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick  bowfinger is steve martins invention  
his script is surprisingly clever as satire  given that the pseudoreligion is a sitting duck  as is the entire los angeles film industry  
  the griffin milltypes take quite a beating  in the form of robert downey jr  as bigwig jerry renfro   
martins decision to tell the story from a bottom feeders point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovativenever have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture  
as expected  there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs  such as martins crew of mexican borderjumpers  who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading  cahiers du cinema   or martins nonsensical explanation to dave  his loyal cinematographer  jamie kennedy   that every movie  in the end  has a budget of twothousand dollars     
most of bowfinger is universally funny  however  i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski  one of our brightest comediennes  is on screen  
bowfingers main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath  
were also asked to believe that a few simple closeups of kit ramsey would redeem  chubby rain   zgrade entertainment that would make ed wood blush  
  this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in ozs last directorial effort  the poorly conceived in  out   
these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece  
as i mentioned at the start of this review  bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather grahams character daisy does  hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom  
that said  it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus  the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome  
martin gets sentimental by storys end as he did in l  a  story  and how could he not  
for those who can hack it  the movies might be the greatest business in the world
