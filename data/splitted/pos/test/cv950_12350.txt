from the man who presented us with henry  the portrait of a serial killer      
comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of floridas south coast  
plot  guidance counselor  dillon  is accused of raping one of his students  
she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida  
the counselor is brought to court on the charges  as another white trash girl  campbell   also joins the rape fingerpointing club  
as the story unfolds  we find that many things arent exactly as they seem  thats as much as i could say without ruining anything   
critique  good little flick that slows down at certain points  and runs a tad long  but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout  
mind you  i could see many people not liking it because it takes  one too many  twists and turns  but hey  i happen to like that kind of thing  
and besides  the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability  or scathingly close to   and even  explained  many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film  do not leave the theatre before you see the credits    it 
really does clear up some stuff     
other than that  the acting was good  with campbell transforming her  good girl stereotypical  role into a potsmoking  gothlooking white trash chick out for a good time  
denise richards  from starship troopers    fame  solidifies herself as hollywoods jellydonut pinup girl of the moment  and proves that all breast implants neednt lead to lawsuits  
bacon is solid  and so is dillon  while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world     
sprinkle the story with a bunch o shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters  bacon showing the world the size of his dingdong  do we really need to see this     a couple of lesbian kissing scenes  and a menageatrois  and youve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre  
on the down side  the soundtrack was not as prominent  or slick  as i thought it would be  and theresa russell  real name  theresa paup  seems to have lost her way in every which way possible     ooooh  
i almost forgot bill murrays exquisite role as the downtrodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court  
murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex  greed and mystery  
little known facts  neve campbell specified a nonnudity clause in her contract  shes also born in guelph  ontario    go 
hoser   
director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together  as it was gratuitous  
kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother  called the bacon brothers  is married to actress kyra sedgwick  and has a game based on him called  six degrees of kevin bacon
