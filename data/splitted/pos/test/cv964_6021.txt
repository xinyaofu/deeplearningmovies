youve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk  
the title is generic  
its meaningless  
and i cant believe its good business  
when you pick up the phone and dial film  how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jeanclaude van damme movie  the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot  is called  geez  maximum risk  
yuck  
the movie itself deserves your attention  
for sweet bloody thrills  this one beats the summer blockbuster competition handsdown  
only mission  impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller  and ill give maximum risk the edge simply because its not as slick as the tom cruise picture  and therefore more gratifying in its execution  
much to my surprise  van damme continues to develop as a pleasant  unpretentious action hero  
his track record isnt as solid as schwarzeneggers  but hes a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold  
in   van damme worked with hong kongs premier hardcore action director  john woo  on a fairly lame movie called hard target  
  if you can find a bootleg copy  woos radically different directors cut is much better than what was eventually released   
this followup is directed by ringo lam  city on fire  full contact   whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woos more operatic offerings  
the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woos subsequent broken arrow  
heres the rundown  
van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend  jeanhugues anglade  finds a corpse thats alains exact double  
turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother  michael  who has been killed by some russian heavies  and some strangely american looking cops   
alain does some investigating  
he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city  and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia  
assuming michaels identity  alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michaels girlfriend  natasha henstridge   the fbi  and the russian mob in little odessa  
thats as much as you need to know  
the story is adequate  but not overly involving  and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice  just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment  
theres a love story  too  but i didnt find it terribly convincing  partly because exmodel henstridge is too highstrung in her highprofile debut  she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species   
shes great to look at  and she can certainly read a line  but what she does here cant really be described as  acting   
of course   acting  isnt really what she was hired for  i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van dammes   
the movie is exceptionally violent  bordering on gratuity  
  keep that in mind when planning your date   
the stunts are spectacular  and the fact that you can spot van dammes standin makes his work no less impressive  
theres only so much you can do with a car wreck  but this movie makes crisp  effective use of pileups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies  
and lam has a surprising  innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action  
the main difference between lam and woo  i believe  is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces  lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and doublebarreled points of view to make things run  
dont get me wrong  when chow yunfat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woos hardboiled  its an amazing moment  
but its a moment thats hard to reproduce in hollywood  
  for one thing  hollywood doesnt yet have chow yunfat   
while woos hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart  maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture  
the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city  but lams use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on  
the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lams shooting style  accentuating rather than amplifying the action  
the performances could have used some fine tuning  in particular  theres an annoying  overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely   and the movie doesnt always overcome the limitations of its genre  
the story is a little mundane  although there are some effective moments involving van dammes unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had  
but its not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture  and its doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity  
van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the mans best movie  and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong konghollywood hybrid
