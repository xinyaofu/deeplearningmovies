on their first  full day  marie sunbathes as jean goes for a swim  
hours later  maries initiated a full scale search when jean hasnt returned  but no trace of him is found  
marie returns to paris and resumes her life  including chats with jean at the end of each day in francois ozons  under the sand   
maries expat british friend amanda  alexandra stewart   frantic   and her french husband gerard  pierre vernier  try to snap marie out of her denial with a dinner party  where they introduce her to the handsome vincent  jacques nolot   nenette et boni    yet marie suggests that gerard accompany her and jean to their gym the next morning  
eventually marie does begin dating vincent  but she discusses him with jean and even smiles at jean  hidden behind a bedroom curtain  when she makes love to vincent  
slowly  though  reality continues to chip away at maries fantasy life  
her bank advises her that without access to jeans account  she needs to reduce her spending  
one of her university students  shes reading virginia woolfs  the waves   turns out to be one of the young men who participated in the beach search  
then police arrive asking her to identify the clothing of a body theyve found washed up from the ocean  
that night  jeans not at home when she returns to their apartment  
her motherinlaw  andree tainsy  cruelly 
insists that jean simply abandoned her out of boredom  
finally  marie goes to the police  insisting on viewing the body  
horrified  shes been warned it was

  under the sand  is a character study and melancholy portrait of aging  ive lost my youth   marie declares  and loss  
charlotte rampling  given the chance to portray an older  yet still sexual  woman runs with it  bringing us into the mind of the character  
her chemistry with bruno cremet is startlingly natural  
as marie returns from her first date with vincent  she sits on the couch with jean  
did he kiss you   he asks  
the mood the two create is incredibly intimate and sad  
ozon   water drops on burning rocks    see the sea    who cowrote the script with emmanuelle bernheim  marcia romano  and marina de van  has turned in a more mature work than his previous  creepy  see the sea   
while he cleverly never lets us see jean enter the water that fateful day  leaving a number of possibilities  accident   suicide   escape  
 open  he definitely tips his hand towards a certain outcome  
cinematography by antoine hiberli and jeanne lapoirie   water drops on burning rocks   glides around marie  their  shot as she initially searches the oceans horizon for a sign of jean conveys her panic  or captures ramplings exotic face in mood divining closeup  
in an inventive fantasy scene  marie imagines jeans hands massaging her feet while in a state of autoarousal  
his two hands become four  then more combined with her own  becoming almost a one person orgy and recalling roman polanskis  repulsion   
original music by philippe rombi quietly adds to the overall melancholy  
  under the sand  is a unique portrait of loss  
it would make an fascinating double bill with liv ullmanns  faithless  from earlier this year  another character study of a woman facing loss for different reasons
