is it just me  or have disney films gradually lost their appeal  
i was almost stunned by the quality of  who framed roger rabbit    a fun  unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together  
  the little mermaid  harkened back to  and perhaps surpassed  the classic disney animations from the first half of the century  
however  the endless stream of  the little mermaid  wannabes is getting to me  
you know the spiel  a lame plot recycled from some wellknown story  colorful  almost psychedelic animation  the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson  the comedic sidekicksidekicks  the seemingly unattainable love interest  a few catchy songs  a few injokes for adults  and the occasional out of place warnerbrotherscoyotefalloffthecliff type joke  
its a formula  and like any formula  it gets tiresome  
thats why im delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli  a japanese cartoon studio  
from what ive seen of their movies   kikis delivery service  and the already englishdubbed and american distributed  my neighbor totoro    foreign audiences are in for a treat  
these movies  particularly  kikis delivery service   are wonderfully original and entertaining  
  kikis delivery service  starts with an unusual premise  kiki  upon hearing forecasts of clear skies  decides it is time for her to leave home  
this is unusual because kiki isnt a college student or a young adult making her start on the world  but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch  
her mother is also a witch  and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training  her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance  
just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences  but no mention is made of the occult  and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie  kikis mother acts as a village doctor  and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom  
kiki must choose a city to move to  and what she chooses is the costar of the movie  a german seaport town  far removed from the country life she has been used to  
initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding  shes discouraged  and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch  
on the verge of leaving for a new town  she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it  
the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier  a onepersons delivery service  
this is where the movie becomes shockingly good  
kikis job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her  
the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesnt seem forced or artificial  but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light  
theyre three dimensional  impossible to quickly evaluate  possessing of faults  and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl  
however  each one has something about them  some interest or trait  that makes them interesting and unique  
the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings  the seaport town genuinely looks impressive  capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the s  
this beauty is beauty with depth  for every detail left in  dozens are only hinted at  
i could probably go on all day  but i wont  suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie  
some of my favorites are kikis relationship with the bakers husband  although hes quiet  never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie  and he initially scares her  his kindness wins her friendship  
in the garage of a deliverees house can be found a vintage model t  two old ladies have a relationship evolving from masterservant to friendfriend  
such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg  
added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of selfworth  
kiki initially seems to derive much of her selfworth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her  but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment  making her question the importance of such beauty  
this causes kiki to lose faith in herself  
however  kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings  but the innate beauty inside her  
seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous  and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i dont even want to hint at it  
the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and  ironically  the most disneyesque moment ive ever seen  if you dont hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention  
the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions  there is no violence  however cartoonish  no songanddance number  and kikis pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick  although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes  
however  i would be surprised if disney doesnt give jiji more jokes  or at least the voice of some comedian  
refreshingly enough  the moral lesson of the movie is not selfcontradicted  a habit disney movies have gotten into  
  beauty and the beast  s beautiful belle  for instance  learned that beauty was derived from a persons inside  and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing  
kiki  on the other hand  learns to separate her wardrobe from her selfimage  and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film  
another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for  kikis delivery service   not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be  but with a greater attention to realism and detail  it fits the movie to a t  this is particularly true with scenes of kikis flights  
the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold  and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film ive ever seen  
im not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states  
disney tentatively plans a theater release of  monoko hime  shortly following the summer  japanese release  and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that  
id guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release  
although the wait is unfortunate  its good to know that its being released at all  for  kikis delivery service  is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release  
watch this movie  
along with  man bites dog   and perhaps something by woody allen  this is the best movie ive ever seen
