  no man is an island   one character quotes john donne in apt pupil  effectively summarizing the movies themes  
while hardly a great film  singers ambitious adaptation of kings short story  is challenging nonetheless  perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it  
apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses  
  wonderbred high school honours student todd bowden  renfro  conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander  a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the s and was never heard from again  
bowden suspects arthur denker  mckellan   the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby  is actually a pseudonymous dussandermuch research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todds theory  
bowden strikes a deal with dussander  in exchange for not revealing his identity  dussander must satisfy bowdens intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view  
the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams  but like a bystander at a traffic accident  todds desire for gory details overrides his repulsion  
bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii  
marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander  it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his  student   among other things  
bowden  who has taken on very hateful qualities  he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook   engages the veteran in an endless game of oneupmanship  
dussander stands to lose his freedom  and bowden his credibilityin effect  his postsecondary school future  
all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable  and unsettling  conclusion  one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source materials excessive climax  
singer has yet to get keyser s  ze out of his system  
his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence  verbals tics and todds goldenboy reputation are plausible ruses   they showcase morally bankrupt antiheroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals  
apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects  a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcomethere was no way you could see the ending coming  as it was all a hoodwink  anyway  
thankfully  singer has gotten most of the usual suspects filmschoolish geek theatrics out of his system  
some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected andor obvious  the dream sequences were extraneous   but the majority of the film is subduedand singers handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murdererintraining  
mckellans and renfros performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film  while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellans finelytuned realization  id like to single out renfros daring work  
he isnt afraid to play someone largely unappealing and coldhearted  he strips his character of vanity  something many of his peers wouldnt do  
  can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylorthomas in the same role   
renfro was recently charged with possession of cocainei hope he doesnt continue down that path  because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him  
as guidance counsellor edward french   friend  schwimmer also deserves mention  
he wants to be the parent to todd that todds own welltodo folks are not  todd  like most modern kidsand onlychildrenhas mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger   and his sincerity makes the apt pupils blackeningheart even more apparent  
but one of the films ultimate questions  are we born evil or do we learn evil   might be answered in french  whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous  
no man is an island  indeedwe all have the capacity to make the  right  or the  wrong  choices  
schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible
