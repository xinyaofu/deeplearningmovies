the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster 
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman 
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  
when those observers are joel and ethan coen  the surreal becomes bizarre  
when the life is that of jeff  the dude  leboswki  the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of  whatsgoingonaroundhere   
the marvelous sound of  the stranger   sam elliot  s voiceover introduces the film  
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  
the dude  jeff bridges  is described as the  laziest man in los angeles  possibly the world   although hes not so much slothful as he is relaxed  
spending the last  years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other  he doesnt have much of a life  but hes having a good time  
when asked what he does for fun  he responds  bowl  drive around and the occasional acid flashback   
lebowskis passion is bowling  
when hes not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike  things just happen to him  
arriving home one night  hes beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  
even worse  they urinate on his rug  
the problem is that the dude doesnt have a wife  
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  
the  big  lebowski  david huddleston  is a multimillionaire and his dudeness lives in tworoom squalor  
the next day  our ragtag hero visits his namesakes mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together  not surprisingly since its virtually the only object there  
when hes denied any money  he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  
on his way out  he runs into lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny  tara reid  who offers to perform a sexual act that  according to rumor  is one of bill clintons favorites for a thousand bucks  
the penniless dude wisecracks that hes heading for the cash machine  
later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunnys kidnappers  
this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences  
the kidnappers are impossibly inept  
the dude and his cronies are even worse  
every plan goes awry  
you can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues  
thats the story  but to tell the truth it doesnt much matter  
there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining  
the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into  
the dudes bowling buddies walter  john goodman  and donny  steve buscemi  look like people youd see on the street but  like everything else in this film  theyre not quite what they seem  
walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties  
everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam  
when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but wont admit it  walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet  
donny gets precious few words in between walters screaming and the dudes rambling  
when he does  walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns  
donny is  out of his league  and doesnt  have a frame of reference   
the film is peppered with people for whom the term  character  would be an understatement  
the big lebowskis daughter maude  an avantgarde  vaginal  artist  paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an sm mary martin  
the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers  
bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star  
most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler  
as the flamenco music swells  we see him putting on his lavender hose  
the camera pans up to an allpurple skintight bowling outfit with  jesus   pronounced with a  j   not an  h   embroidered on the pocket  
he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail  
his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball  
bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has  
i cant think of anyone else who could have done a better job  
buscemi has a limited role  but he plays it perfectly  
the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that hes one of the treasures of our time  
its odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barrs television husband  
more like the coens  raising arizona  than their hit  fargo    the big lebowski  demands an open mind and even more open eyes  
a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen  much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss  
theres so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it  
walking out of the theater  i felt that the film had something important to say  
on further examination  i wasnt sure exactly what it was  
  if you meet jesus at the bowling alley  its not going to be what you expect   
  when the going gets weird  the weird go bowling   
maybe theres no real message  
perhaps its just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world  
maybe thats enough  
  michael redman has written this column for  years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about  the man in the iron mask  starring that favorite of yearold girls of all ages
