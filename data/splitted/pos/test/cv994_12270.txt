a thriller set in modern day seattle  that marked marky marks migration from the  good vibrations  and  calvin klein undie ad  guy  to mark wahlberg  thespianatlarge  and a mighty good one at that

critique  ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love  
well  if you ever have  then this film is definitely for you  
it isnt the most original premise in the world  but it is handled pretty well here  and pretty quickly for that matter  a speedy  minutes   
i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg  of boogie nights infamy       
he completely captured all the goodness  and badness  of the main character of this film  and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him  his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience  as  best villain  at the  mtv movie awards   
the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting  and of course  the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in  look for the nice bikini and butt shots    if 
youre into that kind of thing  that is    
i didnt much care for the fatherdavid relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived  but for the most part  i was really into this movie  
then again  daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the  big deal  was about his daughter dating david  
his reply   the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps  and the girl is my daughter   
good point  
all in all  the movie kicked some fun ass  mindless as it was  and effectively demonstrated every parents worst nightmare  
mind you  i still cant tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag  but hey  life goes on  
and on a personal note  we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual  and let me tell you all    it was a flaming success
