one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsys wedding  
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it  
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald  who hasnt made a worthwhile film since   
but the fact is  betsys wedding is also an alan alda film  
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years  alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects  including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life  
written and directed by alda  betsys wedding is a vibrant sliceoflife  mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor  
aldas comic elixir is smooth and refreshingand a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare  
as bride and groom  molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film  but they are by far the least interesting  
walsh is a nonentity  with all the screen presence of a door knob  
ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain  
she looks hideous with her shortcropped orange hair  red lipstick and grotesque outfits  
shes supposed to be a dress designer  but she looks more like a clown  
and to make matters worse  ringwalds performance matches her appearance  
thankfully  alda keeps ringwalds screen time to a minimum  he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters  
the wedding is just a device to bring together the brides workingclass  italian family and the grooms rich  gentile family  
ringwalds folks are homey and downtoearth  with alda as her freespirited father  madeline kahn as her practical mother  and ally sheedy as her lonely sister  
walshs clan  on the other hand  is prim  proper and ostentatious  
when the two families meet and mingle  the movie becomes a story of culture clash  or as one character puts it   money versus values   
ally sheedy  in a wonderfully understated performance  is one of the films most pleasant surprises  
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body  
its anthony lapaglia  however  who seizes the spotlight  
lapaglia plays stevie dee  a suave  overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with oldfashioned chivalry  
lapaglias sincere but dimwitted character is a riot  
and whats uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro  with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure  
lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting  and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his rolemodel and partly a ripoff  
i dont know whether to say a star is born or a star is reborn  but i do know that lapaglias overthetop performance should not be missed  
the scrumptious comic acting  however  extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia  
joe pesci  in particular  sinks his teeth into his role as aldas unscrupulous brotherinlaw  a slum lord with mob ties  who is cheating on his wife  catherine ohara   
alda  faced with challenge of both directing and acting  somehow finds just the right comic touch as the brides financiallystrapped father  a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet  
the film adopts aldas psychological point of view as he tries to one  plan the wedding  and two  pay for it  
as a filmmaker  aldas style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful  
and while he doesnt have the comic genius of a woody allen  alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy
