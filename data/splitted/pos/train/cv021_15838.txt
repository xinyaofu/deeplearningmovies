one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction  
the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy  innocent fun  
sometimes the stories are compelling  
sometimes theyre not  
but  with the exception of the first film in the series  which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces   ive never been bored by any of the enterprises numerous missions  
star trek  insurrection is no exception  
the film has gotten some negative reviews  a friend of mine actually thinks its the worst in the series   but im not really sure why  
its an exciting  often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film  
some say its a bit too light  and more of a long episode than a film  
others say the special effects are cheesy and that its boring  
i simply enjoyed the film  
insurrection  which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast  introduces us to a race of people called the baku  the baku are very old  most of them are about three hundred years old   but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet  
of course  these peaceful people cant horde this fountain of youth all for themselves  leave it up to their archenemies  the sona  led by ruafo  f  
murray abraham   to mess everything up  
the sona  who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable  strike a deal with the federation to move the baku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying  
thats when captain picard  patrick stewart  steps in  he realizes that moving the baku would kill them  it also helps that he falls in love with a baku woman  donna murphy    
so  with his trusty crew  picard defies the federation to keep the baku in their natural habitat  
when dealing with a series with as much history as this  its not entirely necessary to reintroduce your characters with each episode  
this is why i believe nonfans have a hard time getting into star trek  in order to enjoy it  one has to understand how to approach it  
insurrection  however  does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters  
stewart is bold as always  a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together  
jonathan frakes  who also directed  is funny as commander riker  a subplot with data  brent spiner  discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting  and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain  overacting like crazy  
frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact  insurrection is an exciting film  with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action  
this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation  and the result is very pleasing to the eye  particularly in the climactic scenes  in which the sona employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the baku planet  the special effects have a clean  impressively sharp look  
if i have any complaint about the film  its that it tries to take a moral stance when its not very appropriate to do so  
i dont think its that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move  baku in order to save the lives of thousands  
better yet  why couldnt they have coexisted  
insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience  
with its inherent camp factor  the star trek series doesnt seem wellequipped to deal with issues like this  
i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle
