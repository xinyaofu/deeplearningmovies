call  for the cliche police if you must  but the eyes are the window to the soul  
the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze  paul newman  ralph fiennes  anthony hopkins  morgan freeman  
you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds  that the characters they play are real human beings  
we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor  but he had that unique quality in his eyes  
in gridlockd  an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire  shakur and his costar tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry  
shakur and roth play ezekiel  spoon  whitmore and alexander  stretch  rome  two detroit buddies who share a spoken wordjazz trio  an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie  thandie newton   
when a new years eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose  spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time  
they soon make a new years resolution to get into rehab  but that proves to be easier said than done  
as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough  spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy  confusion and red tape  
the government might be the least of their obstacles  however  as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer  and on the run from a nasty thug  vondie curtis hall   
in order for you to buy into gridlockd at all  you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism  unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie  they are going to government offices on new years day  in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all  
gridlockd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey  s falling down  which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles  
in falling down  michael douglas dfens  the characters personalized license plate  echoed in gridlockd by the drug lord drepers plates  whips out a gun because he cant get breakfast at mcdonalds  in gridlockd  spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center  
and where the unhinged dfens became a heroic surrogate for audiences  writerdirector vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation  
one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question   do you expect the world to stop    just 
because you picked today to clean up   
the world in gridlockd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down  but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time  
hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system  but perhaps not enough of them  
a significant chunk of gridlockd is devoted to spoon and stretchs flight from dreper and from the police  and those subplots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments  
in one scene  stretch scares off dreper by getting chummy with a police officer  another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenlysuspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures  
the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running  while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time  
hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the films main events  perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through selfdestructive behavior  
oh  the irony of it  
tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case  and living the life to back it up  
in gridlockd  shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him  
spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall  but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction  
mostly it comes through those eyes  eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta  
it is spoon who plays conscience to stretchs pure appetite  and roth plays stretch with a gleeful selfdestructiveness  he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again  which is as much an obstacle to spoons goal as any agency or enemy  
gridlockds most cruelly comic scene finds stretch  helping  spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife  and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him  
with friends like that  spoon doesnt need enemies  and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much  
the tragedy now is that we wont get more chances to see those eyes again
