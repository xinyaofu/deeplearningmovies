hilarious  ultralow budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers  brian ohalloran and jeff anderson   
they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to selffulfillment  
the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all getout  but you could spend ten times the films budget  a reported     and still not get dialogue half as good as this  
originally rated nc for language  
not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears  
killing zoe  
remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and youre halfway to killing zoe  writerdirector roger avarys slowmoving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery  
eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in  way  over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers  
hes the safecracker whos blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go  
though intriguing on all fronts  the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction  which avary cowrote with quentin tarantino  
in english and french  
the road to wellville  
based on the novel by t  coraghessan boyle  the road to wellville doesnt go very far  
bowels  bowels  and more bowels are explored by dr  john harvey kellogg  a bucktoothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins   who  in the early s  advocated abstinence  vegetarianism  and frequent defecation  
he also invented the cornflake  
really  
checkingin to kelloggs battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda  just two of the many wellknown faces in this failed comedy  
leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack  michael lerner  lara flynn boyle  john neville  and dana carvey  
the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing  but the novelty quickly wears off as writerdirector alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doodoo into drama  
what he ends up with is something that i cant print here  
phew  
stargate  
lawrence of arabia meets star wars  
this epic scifi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else  
director roland emmerich  universal solider  shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on  
the film is overlong  the characters are cardboard  and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern scifi history  
that said  theres still plenty to watch here  
scifi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands  the morphing headdresses  and a surprisingly spunky james spader  
he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that  somebody else  built the pyramids  
less interesting are costars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame  
star trek generations  
trek fans may be more forgiving  but  for the rest of us  the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best  
the story is interesting  but each scene goes too long  
the cast is earnest  but the direction lacks punch  
and so on  
  the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii   
original enterprise captain james t  kirk appears on both ends of the story  though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead  get a life   
remarkably unremarkable  
miracle on th street  
in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al  maybe a remake of miracle on th street  is  necessary  
john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfielddirected production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the  original  
the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesnt work too well  but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle  
his chemistry with children can moisten any eye  
no claus for alarm  
junior  
arnold schwarzenegger pregnant  
sure  billy crystal did it before in rabbit test  but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie  
what should be nothing more than a onejoke premise actually gets better as it goes along  
director ivan reitman  dave  twins  wisely keeps the farce to a minimum  so the first hour moves slower than you might expect  
dont expect too many yuks from danny devito  but you cant beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie  
hows  that  for a collision of acting styles
