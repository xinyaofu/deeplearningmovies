youve heard all the hype  
youve seen all their faces  natalie portman  the professional  as queen amidala  liam neeson  schindlers list  as quigon jinn  ewan mcgregor  trainspotting  as obiwan kenobi  and jake lloyd  jingle all the way  as young anakin skywalker  
if youve read any reviews  youve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy  
you also may have heard that this ones too kiddiefriendly  and doesnt have enough content for adults  
believe the hype  
the effects are stunning  the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic  the lightsaber duels are amazing  and queen amidalas sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth  
but theres something missing here  and it isnt budget or effects  its everything money  cant  buy  
the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broadstroked and flat characters  
the most successful at this is liam neeson who  as quigon jinn  a jedi master to young obiwan kenobi  has quiet dignity and a wise  commanding presence  
he is the anchor to this movie  as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out  
portmans queen amidala and mcgregors obiwan kenobi dont fare nearly so well  
amidala  the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation       comes off as stoic  stilted and caricatured  it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life   
and obiwan  although mcgregor makes him very endearing  has so little screen time that hes nothing but a robin to quigon jinns batman  
however  mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity  and he does a good job  
he also absolutely nails alec guiness  obiwan in episode     scottish accent  and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise  
in fact  lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit  and thats one of the problems with this film  
i would never call myself a  star wars  fan  especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days  but ive always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america  
however  if you are the one person in america who  hasnt  seen the films at all or even recently  or who doesnt bother to brushup on the names of obscure characters  you may be hopelessly lost  
for example  one of the films main  nefarious  characters is senator palpatine  
for those of you not recently steeped in  star wars  trivia  emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vaders master in  return of the jedi  and  empire strikes back   
so  obviously  his appearance in  phantom menace  is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series  thus making his role here more meaningful  
a lot of the movie is like that  
rd and cpo make token appearances  and its obvious that lucas is banking on the audiences preexisting fondness for them    
because he doesnt do much to add to it in any way  
same goes for jabba the hutt  who doesnt look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy  
even  planets  make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film  tatooine  the desert world where luke grew up   coruscant  the cloud city from  empire strikes back    and alderaan  leias home planet  which we never actually see  that gets blown up in  star wars   show up or are mentioned briefly in passing  
whats the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films  
the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty  
theres no meat  no substance  that makes you want to love the characters as they are  not as they will be  
another problem is that there are actually  too many  alien characters in the film  
i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters  strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters  had mouths that barely moved  making them look more like muppets than actual characters  
and jar jar binks  a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character  is intended as comic relief  but what he really becomes is annoying  and fast  
unlike chewbacca and cpo  who got their humanity  if youll pardon the expression  from their interactions with the human characters  jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind  at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive  teenage mutant ninja turtles   
furthermore  the dialogue is often stilted and corny  and sometimes downright infantile  thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot  
oddly  this isnt just  my  judgment  lucas has said that he designed this film for kids  
well  hes done a good job  
the hero of this film  of course  is young anakin  but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eightyearold boy  
thats not jake lloyds fault  though  he does a good job of being a cute kid  which is apparently all lucas asked of him  
thats another mistake  of course  because the cute tyke becomes darth vader  
warning  spoilers ahead     
in my opinion  there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakins future evil in the film  
the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks  and theres nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie  
he has a doting mother  pernilla august  making her first english language film  and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine  
but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isnt all hearts and roses is yodas hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under quigon jinn  
his explanation  
  his future is clouded   
  warning  major spoiler ahead  
enter at your own risk   
of course  the noble quigon dies at the hand of darth maul  a scarylooking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts  but has turned to the dark side  
this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie  but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his doublesided lightsaber  and his scary facial makeup  
because quigon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force  obiwan  quigons young padawan apprentice  one level below knightdom   must take over the training himself  
so  at the end of the movie  we end where the saga actually begins  with obiwan kenobi and his young apprentice  anakin  darth vader  skywalker  
did this story need to be told  
i would say no  
but is it a worthwhile movie to see  
absolutely  
if you dont enter the theater with jedisize expectations  and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle  then this is your movie  
the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation  
the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight  
and yoda and young obiwan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler  happier time  
above all  this is a fun movie  
not deep  not meaningful  and not profound  
but fun  
maybe next time  lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to cowrite the script  and the guy who directed  empire  will direct  
because if lucas does the next one himself  it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most  potential
