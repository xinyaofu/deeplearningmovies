unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi  an artist whose palette is fabric  
ostensibly  the film is a documentary  but use of that term requires stretching its meaning  
many scenes appear staged  and a great deal of cuttingandpasting has been done in the editing room  
the cinema verite effect is a conceit  genuine spontaneity is at a premium  and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera  especially wouldbe actresses like cindy crawford   
director douglas keeve  who was mizrahis lover at the time  freely admits that he  couldnt care less about the truth  but was more interested in capturing  the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion   
despite violating nearly every rule of  legitimate  documentary film making  however  unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment  
while it sheds only a little light on the behindthescenes world of the fashion industry  it presents a fascinating  if incomplete  picture of designer mizrahi  
this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study  hes funny  energetic  and eminently quotable  
he has unusual views on just about everything  from fashion   its about women not wanting to look like cows   to mary tyler moore   between her and jackie kennedy  they shaped this country   to style   its almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs    
unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress  
its almost certainly different that anyone would imagine  
the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look  including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies  then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection  
in particular  unzipped traces mizrahis development of his fall  line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show  which highlights a number of prominent models  including cindy crawford  naomi campbell  kate bush  and linda evangelista  
on the technical side  a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped  
a variety of film stocks were used  super    mm blackandwhite  and  mm color  
there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness  the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie  and  during the climactic fashion show  color is used to show the audiences perspective  while blackandwhite is for the behindthe scenes sequences  
nevertheless  some viewers will be put off by this treatment  
while unzipped isnt an expose on the fashion industry per se  keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear  
overall  however  this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else  and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed  
when the designer declares that  everything is frustrating except designing clothes  thats beautiful and liberating   it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed
