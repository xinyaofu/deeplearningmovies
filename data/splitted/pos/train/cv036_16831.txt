dora  fernanda montenegro  sits behind a makeshift desk at rios major train station  
she  in her colorful demeanor  offers a service that is unheard of in the states  
she writes letters for the illiterate  who pass through  to try to find lost relatives  find love  or search after lost debts  
shes quirky  shes elderly  shes caring  
totally trustworthy  right  
not a chance  
once home  she never sends these letters  saving money on postage  and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene  mar  lia p  ra   
one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nineyear old son  looking for their father  
shortly thereafter  she gets hit by a bus  and the son is orphaned  
days go by  and the boy  named josu   roams around the station  hungry  desperate  and somewhat clueless to his predictament  
through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon  dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu  s father  
this means leaving the security of rio  traveling to the outskirts of brazil  where unpaved roads  religious devotees and the povertystricken become commonplace  
films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films  
it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world  so distant from my own  
it does so entertainingly  and so heartwrenchingly  
and yet  its backdrop is merely that  
the focus is on the minute transformation of dora  of how she learns to love this little kid  without being cloying or sentimental  
the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film  
dora being an amoral scamartist  could care less about the amount of bickering between the candlelighting of the catholics versus the bumpersticker mentality of the evangelicals  
but neither side is trivialized  
she even begins to develop an affection for a nondrinking evangelical  who sees the problems with dora  if not initially  
fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance  but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira  who plays josu   
he  like the discoveries of j  r  mie renier  la promesse  and giorgio cantarini  life is beautiful   prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states  
he is a natural  and never once grating
