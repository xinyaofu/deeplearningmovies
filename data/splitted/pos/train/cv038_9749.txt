sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest  
some people call it  original  or  artsy  or  abstract   
some people simply call it  trash   
a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings  
definitely a generationx aimed movie  a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaokebased musical dream sequence  
whew  
anyone in their s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film  
its somewhat silly  its somewhat outrageous  and its definitely not your typical romance story  but for the right audience  it works  
a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting  
well sorry folks  but i havent seen trainspotting so i cant really compare  
whether that works in this films favor or not is beyond me  
but i do know this  ewan mcgregor  whom i had never had the pleasure of watching  definitely charmed me  
he was great  
cameron diazs character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp  
the audience may find it difficult to care about her  thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him  
misguided  
you bet  
loveable  
you bet  
a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city  utah  
this was just one more thing i didnt know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke  
maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise  but i think even if i had known  i would have been just as happy  
a life less ordinary is quirky  eccentric  and downright charming  
not for everyone  but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies
