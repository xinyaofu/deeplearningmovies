it lost that award to chariots of fire  but did manage to win for best art direction  best special effects  best film editing and best sound  
actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones  but was committed to his hit tv show   magnum p  i    
in filming the well of souls sequence  the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on  
hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas  
however  once all the snakes were on set  it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them  so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths  and these were used as well  
looking closely  you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not  
an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra  
during his escape from the museum where it was housed  he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong  
also in the same script  indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild minecart chase sequence  
both of these scenes were cut from the script  but ended up in s indiana jones and the temple of doom  
this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo  
the same type of opening is present in its sequels  
jocks airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number  obcpo   
this is a reference to obiwan and cpo from george lucas star wars       
also  the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of rd and cpo  
they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark  
the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip  
as legend has it  actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time  and asked if the scene could be shortened  
spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy  
the entire crew laughed and thats how it was filmed  
when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra  you can see the snakes reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford  also some fingerprints and stuff like that  
when indy is dragging along the ground  hanging onto the nazi soldiers truck with the ark inside  you can see the pad that hes being dragged on
