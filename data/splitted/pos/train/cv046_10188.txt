at first glance  it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of year olds  
thats true of home alone  and id bet money that its true of home alone   opening soon   
but home alone actually has a lot going for it  and the cartoon slapstick doesnt get in the way  
the mcalisters  all  of them  are going to france for the holidays  
four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse  
the littlest kid  kevin  is the victim of the older kids cruelty  
kevins patience runs out when he learns that his plaincheese pizza has already been eaten  and hes going to have to starve  
he attacks his big bully brother buzz  who had been teasing him  
the fight disrupts the alreadychaotic dinner  spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table  a few cousins  and an uncle  
the kneejerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin  
nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased  but they all point their fingers when he fights back  
the ultimate punishment comes from mom  catherine ohara  who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night  
on his way up the stairs  he tells her that  families suck  and that he hopes never to see any of his family again  
that night the power goes out  knocking out the alarm clocks  so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport  
in a surprisingly plausible setup  kevin is mistakenly accounted for  and the family heads off without him  
its interesting that  in a subtle way  his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children  
first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling  and second  they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class  
theyre twothirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child  
meanwhile  kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true  
hes finally rid of his family  
life is a dream come true  
he can jump on the beds  watch rrated movies  eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips  and dig through his big brothers secret box  
slowly  the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane  
he grooms himself  he does the laundry  he goes shopping   i bought some milk  eggs  and fabric softener    
he also starts to miss his family  not just for their company  but for the security they bring  
the furnace in the basement is a scary monster  the old man next door is a snowshovel murderer  and two crooks are trying to break into his house  
macaulay culkin is cute but he isnt much of an actor  
still  we can see that kevins character grows  thanks to some good direction and editing  
for example  acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night  just as  santa  is getting in his car  
kevin asks the man to pass on his request  he wants his family back  to the real santa  
he learned how to deal with the furnace  
you turn on the lights and its not so scary anymore  
he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snowshovel murderer  who actually turns out to be a nice man  
they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid  
finally  in the last  minutes  kevin confronts his last fear  the bandits  head on  literally   
this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick  and after the movies genuine dramatic setup  it is dessert  
its a lot of fun  and it doesnt overwhelm the rest of the movie  
on the whole  home alone is a great holiday movie  
john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls  and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings  
but it does have its flaws  
the smallest problem is that culkin doesnt act very well  
as i said before  he is cute  but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkins insight into his character  
the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda  the villains threaten kevins life about five times  
instead of  im gonna get that kid  they say  im gonna kill that kid   
some might argue that the tone is the same  but i strongly disagree  
mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic fauxpas  
ill probably never see home alone   and i wish i had skipped home alone   but i do enjoy home alone almost every year  
dont let your impressions of the others detract from the original  which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick
