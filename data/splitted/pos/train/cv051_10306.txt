every year  hollywood crowns a new  it boy  a young actor pegged for major movie stardom  
inheriting the mantle from last years  winner   matthew mcconaughey  is matt damon  and  like mcconaughey  he proves to be more than just a fresh young face  as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in releasejohn grishams the rainmaker and good will hunting  
damon has his first major starring role  a la mcconaughey  in a john grisham adaptationin this case  francis ford coppolas take on the rainmaker  
damon plays wetbehindtheears attorney rudy baylor  who  immediately after passing the bar exam  finds himself representing the mother  mary kay place  of a terminally ill young man  john whitworth  in a bigleague suit against a negligent insurance company  
while rudys  and the films  main concern is this case  he also finds time to protect a young wife  claire danes  from her abusive husband  melrose placer andrew shue  in a mercifully brief role   
written for the screen and directed by coppola  the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously  
coppolas most notableand effectivecontribution to the triedandtrue grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself  which largely comes in the presence of danny devito  as rudys unlicensed cocounsel  and golden globe nominee jon voight  as the insurance companys hotshot attorney   
the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous  but danes is as superb as always  
then  of course  there is damon  who nicely juggles the weighty  the insurance case  the spousal abuse  and the humorous  rudys often comical naivete  requirements of his role without missing a beat  
as good as he is in the rainmaker  damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting  directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself  
damon plays the title character  will hunting  a troubled young construction workerjanitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius  
in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction  an mit math professor  stellan skarsgard  taps his old college friend  community college psychologist sean mcguire  robin williams   to counsel the abrasive  standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life  
good will hunting is the touchyfeely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests  but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damons intelligent script touches  
even though no one  and  if so  very few people  can directly relate to wills burden of superhuman intelligence  the insecurities he suffers are universal  
the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors  
williams delivers a nice dramatic turn  affleck  a hot upandcoming actor himself  chasing amy   turns up in a warm and charming performance as wills best friend  and the everappealing minnie driver shines as wills harvardschooled love interest  
the clear standout in the cast  though  is damon  who bravely does not soften wills prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard not to care for him  
so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine  but based on his impressive work in john grishams the rainmaker and especially good will hunting  it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come
