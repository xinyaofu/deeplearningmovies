up until about a year ago  john travoltas career consisted of those  look whos talking  movies  notice how they never called them look whos talented  and the  bomb shout  which was bad enough to make most people scream   
but somewhere along the line  travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again  
weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in  would experience fame and fortune once again  while barry  robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a  straighttothecutoutbin album aptly named  size isnt everything   and of course  they learned that sales are everything   
but now travoltas back on the hollywood scene once again  and i think we all know why  
four words  contract with the devil  
and this has nothing to do with newt gingrichs  contract with america   
no  satan is much more humane  
anyway  yes  travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld  
how do i know  
i own the document in question  
amazing what you can buy at those collectors shops for a few hundred dollars  isnt it  
get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction  with travolta as crime minion chili palmer  
he goes to collect some of the mafias money from a bgrade director  gene hackman  and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game  
sure  a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood  but i guess thats beside the point  
palmer is determined to get hackmans next project made  so he sets out to convince big star martin weir  danny devito  to star in the movie  bringing along downandout horror actress karen flores  rene russo   who has already had affairs with hackman and devito  
it doesnt take a las vegas oddsmaker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well  after the customary sexual tension and denial  which has been used in every comedy from  whos the boss   
to speechless  
it works in this case  unlike  whos the boss   
although its interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also  
complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackmans other films and want in on this one too  along with travoltas mob boss trying to track him down for defecting  
get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction  despite the obvious similarities  
this movie doesnt have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year  yes  even better than halloween vi   
get shorty is my kind of movie  one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence  
im definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on  
are you getting this  shorty
