disneys th animated feature a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with  well  the superman story is surprisingly soft at the center  
great wit  great art  and a great villain  james woods as hades  lord of the underworld and local lounge act  cant quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero  his colorfully monotonous sidekick  danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil   and a largely unremarkable soundtrack  
  none of the alan menkendavid zippel tunes are particular ly noteworthy  
some lack lyrical snap  
others need more memorable melodies  
boring ballads we expect  but boring production numbers  too   
so  hercules is a bit of a long sit  but you wont stay bored  
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action  herc battling a cgi hydra   a steady stream of anachronisms   somebody call ixii   and pop references   lets get ready to rumble    a la aladdin  and several longoverdue jabs at the mouses marketing and merchandising depart ments  
while not as rocksolid as hunchback  its a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas  
directed by ron clements and john musker  with voice credits including tate donovan  susan egan  bob goldthwait  matt frewer  samantha eggar  paul shaffer  and  as lighting bolt zeus  rip torn  whos having a very good summer  also appearing in trial and error and men in black
