theres an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last  
george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy  
return of the jedi  the final installment of the series  is easily the most innovative  actionpacked  and entertaining of the three films  
the dark  eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone  
instead  for return of the jedi  we have good triumphing decisively over evil  a resolution to a love triangle  and walking teddy bears  
even darth vader doesnt seem very intimidating this time around  
with the arrival of the emperor  an apparitionlike creature played by ian mcdiarmid   vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman  
return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back  
luke skywalker  mark hamill   princess leia  carrie fisher   lando calrissian   billy dee williams   chewbacca  peter mayhew   cp  anthony daniels  and rd  kenny baker  are on a rescue mission to lukes home planet of tatooine  
their goal  to save han solo  harrison ford  from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt  
it is at jabbas home  a creepylooking stone fortress guarded by hognosed beasts  that most of the added special effects come into play  
from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabbas sand barge  the effects are top notch  
as soon as han is freed from his cryofreeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt  its back to outer space  where the rebel alliance is about to face the empires newest threat  a second  more powerful death star  that  if activated  could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor  
so  while the fleet prepares for the final battle  luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks  
there  they are befriended by the ewoks  the teddy bearlike native race  and luke  fearing that his presence is endangering the group  turns himself over to vader  
return of the jedi has some interesting elements  
the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and wellacted  
from a technical pointofview  the space battles are amazing  easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films  
not only are there many  many more ships  but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved  
on one level  return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects  
in the special edition  even more ships are added  making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch  
the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films  
by now  or then     mark hamill  harrison ford  and carrie fisher have all matured in their onscreen personas  
the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific  
as in empire  billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for  
newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy  cunning  and evil creature  although hes not as imposing as vader was in star wars  
although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen  return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment  
with the spectacular  new special effects  the adorable ewoks  the sinister jabba the hutt  the evil emperor  the same old millenium falcon  darth vaders incredible betrayal  the destruction of the new death star  and the always lovable yoda  return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang  
congratulations to george lucas  whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come
