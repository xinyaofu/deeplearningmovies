but life has a way of complicating things  
pip becomes an arrogant s  o  b  
until he learns just who his secret benefactor is  
in this new  version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn  ethan hawke  with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict  robert de niro   
but soon the focus of finns life becomes romance  as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella  gwyneth paltrow   an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment  
estella was raised in wealth by ms  dinsmoor  anne bancroft   an eccentric  aged and embittered  manhating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage  
this causes estella to fear the daylight of relationships  but finn thinks its just a case of snobbery  
when finn becomes a young man  an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist  
finn leaves florida with  great expectations  to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella  
what will happen to all of finns  great expectations   
opinion  if youre looking for a romance with a happy ending  look no further  youve found one here  
ethan hawke is romantic lead  
  he romanced winona ryder in reality bites  
he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise  
he romanced uma thurman in gattaca  
now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow  a railthin blonde   
hawke plays a lovestruck  earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film  
meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess  estellas whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate  
anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms  dinsmoor  while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably  
the difference between the classic dickens novel and this  adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love  whereas great expectations    is more artsy  less complicated story about a s artist dealing with a lifetime tease
