mpaa  not rated  though i feel it would likely be pg  for martialarts violence   
with three movies already  re  released theatrically in america  and at least three more on their way  jackie chan is one of the newest  hot properties  in action adventure stardom  and its just about time  
for over twentyfive years  jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong  thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
  drunken master  has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to  make it big  this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
im not entirely sure why  exactly  
in many ways   drunken master  is similar to most of jackies other early films  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii   master with cracked fingers    half a loaf of kung fu    spiritual kung fu   and others  
in fact  looking at all these early films together  one gets the impression that they were stamped out  cookiecutter style  at a rate of four to six per year  all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest  i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
theyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past  with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
  drunken master   though its plot is tighter than some  is no exception  
  as an aside   drunken master  was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw  and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle  as part of an asian film festival  
at the time  i didnt really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it  its kind of grown on me   
  drunken master  s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii and  master with cracked fingers  slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harshseeming master  and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end  a formula that has been  adapted   to put it kindly  by american films such as karate kid   
more specifically  jackie chan plays the part of wong feihong  aka  naughty panther   a funloving  practicaljoking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good  but not quite good enough  
after embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly  then beating up a bully in a marketplace  wong feihong tries to hit on a pretty girl  but discovers that she  and her mother  can hit back  better than he can    and 
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt  respectively  
his father  wong keiying  is unhappy about this  and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  
keiying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment  which feihong does not like at all  
while escaping from this punishment  feihong meets up with a drunken old man  who proceeds to thrash him soundly  then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  
this turns out to be su huachi  a legendary master of drunkenstyle kung fu  
he assigns feihong a series of bizarre tasks  such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame  cracking walnuts with his hands  and other such exercises  that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  
then  when hes ready  he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  
unfortunately  the lazy feihong only practices six of them    
  drunken master  features some wonderful martial arts sequences  with jackie winning some fights and losing others  
its been said before  but ill say it againthese fights dont just happen  theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance  and it shows  
in his fights  jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches  jugs  cups  bowls  fruits and vegetablesoften in new and surprising ways  
the fight scenes  particularly those toward the end of the film  are unparallelled in most american films  
whether jackie wins or loses  its really something to see    and 
its often as funny as anything  too  
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very  very good at  
theres very little thats new in this moviejackie winning fights  jackie getting beaten badly by a master  jackie going through punishment or training    these 
schticks have all been seen before  in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties  
but theyre still hilarious as ever  
likewise  jackie has a great supporting cast  many of whom were also in other early jackie films  and theyre often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own  
the really big thing about  drunken master   though  that inspired several copycats  including a couple starring jackie himself  and a sequel fifteen years later  was the drunkenstyle kung fu  
im not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu  but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security    and 
it apparently helps if youre drunk while youre doing it  
genuine or not  i have to admit  theres just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whats going on  
come to think of it  perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films    its 
not just martial arts  its the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go   whoa     
on the negative side  the cinematography in this film is nothing special  the film stock is rather primitive  the plot is often rather slow  and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background  
  gone with the wind   this isnt  
still  if you like martial arts films  or like what youve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more  give it a shot  
its much more  real  than chuck norris or jeanclaude van damme  
you might very well like it  
another interesting thing about  drunken master  has to do with its video availability in the us  
  drunken master  is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original  letterboxed  hong kong subtitled form  commercially available on vhs  from magnum video  in a gold box  for about    
there are plenty of other early jackie films around  but these are typically either in dubbed  panandscanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase  
thankfully   drunken master   at least  is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen  at a very affordable price  
if you like  drunken master   take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there  even the dubbed ones arent really too bad    if 
nothing else  you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue   
i particularly recommend  spiritual kung fu    half a loaf of kung fu   the  fearless hyena  movies  and  snake  crane arts of shaolin   
also  the mostlyunrelatedstorywise sequel   drunken master ii   will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year  though what its americanrelease title will be is still uncertain  and comes highly recommended by this reviewer  
also  for a rather different interpretation of the character wong feihong  who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore   ive been told to suggest the  once upon a time in china  series starring jet li  though i havent personally seen any of them yet   
if you choose to watch  drunken master   i really hope you enjoy it  and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema thats out there  
all in all  i give this film an
