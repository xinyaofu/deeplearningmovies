logical time travel movies are a nearimpossibility  
considering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities  writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  
occasionally  we get a film that does manage it  
terry gilliams   monkeys  was one such film  
but more frequently  we get films that dont much deal with it at all  
there is one question to ask in this case  does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies  
the  terminator  films made up for them with exciting action   back to the future  did it with an entertaining story  and the new film  frequency  pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own  
is  frequency  filled with plot holes  
yes  
does it matter  
not really  
the film opens in october of   
firefighter frank sullivan  dennis quaid  puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job  then goes home to his loving wife julia  elizabeth mitchell  and son johnny  daniel henson   
the doublepronged story flashes forward to   where johnny  now jim caviezel  is all grown up and working as a police detective  
a strange occurrence  the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city  allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in  and that john has found in the present day  
though both are initially skeptical of the idea  john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire  and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  
now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive  john is initially overjoyed  until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous  a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  
frank and john now must work together to set things right  with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  
the premise of  frequency  is unusual  and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept  john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  
this isnt explained  you just have to go with it  
when frank doesnt die in a fire  john is the only one who remembers it differently  while everyone else remembers it the new way  
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities   and   are to each other  
sometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world  and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time  
now  the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this  and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted  but nevertheless logical  if i thought about it hard enough  for example  the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world  and john is only witnessing the  projection  of that change   but explanations arent really the point  
when  frequency  gets cooking  its a riveting little thriller  even if it is confusing  
what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment  and  frequency  works as long as it keeps moving  
the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion  
director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure  frequency  as good hollywood entertainment  establishing decent  likable characters  making us care for them  and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved  
i liked many of the creative touches  the split screens  allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities  and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward  
it actually uses the  metsorioles world series  the one that featured the amazin mets  to great effect  frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him  
  admittedly  this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself   
i even liked the final scene  which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods  
some may find this scene blindingly confusing  as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious  but it does make sense if you think about it  and give the script a lot of leeway   and lets face it  its a darn cool way to end the film  
there are enough surprises and plot twists in  frequency  to keep you on your toes  and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant  
the other major thing to appreciate about  frequency  is the handling of the fatherson relationship  
quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily  its a rocksolid job from both actors  
the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept  how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative  or with a future descendant  
watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question  
the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film  if we dont believe in the characters  we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot  
here  we do care  because we like the lead actors  
i also liked some of the supporting cast members  
elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles  playing julia the doting wife  and  mother  but still performs admirably  
andre braugher  late of the television show  homicide  life on the street   gives a nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john  
he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes  
braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here  simultaneously dismayed and amused  
perhaps the only thing i didnt like about  frequency  is the overly sentimental coda  during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard  
but thats only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics  
i freely acknowledge that  frequency  may best work as a  guy  movie  since it focuses on the very maleoriented idea of fatherson relationships  echoes of  field of dreams  can be easily heard   but the underlying concept is universally applicable  
who wouldnt want to speak with a longdead parent  
or see how their children turn out  
  tell me about your life  son   excuse me while i mist up  
and dont call me a sissy
