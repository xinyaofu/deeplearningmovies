       minor plot spoilers in review             no major spoilers are in review       
the previous two  alien  films have each had their own unique styles to them  
the ridley scotts alien was very much a stylistic suspense film  
james camerons aliens was much more of an action film  
and i liked each film separately for which it was  
now alien  is out  
and it is its own film in the same right that alien and aliens were  
unlike aliens  alien  requires that you have seen aliens  
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off  
the survivors of the expedition to lv are returning home after battling and beating the aliens  
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item  an egg  
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch  find its quarry  which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured  an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel  
this vessel crash lands on fury   
everyone in the vessel is killed  except ripley  
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash  
fury  is an exminingmaximum security prison  
when closed down  some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet  
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years  
ripleys arrival sparks a problem with the inmates  
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoners sport  there is an infestation of lice on the planet  
being an exprison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons  
so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own  
i will not go into detail  but you can guess what happens here  
the alien is loose and no one believes ripleys outstanding story  
she finds comfort in the arms of the colonys doctor  
yes  after  years ripley has sex  
it is not gratuitous  in fact  we dont even see them kiss  but it is just as well  
a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film  
there is a lot more gore in alien   
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien  than either of the earlier two  
it also sports a new alien with  legs  
i wont say how  but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle  which i am sure will be explored in alien   
sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character  
her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination  
the rest of the cast is also quite good  
notably  charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury   
alien  has a very distinct look  
this is due largely to its director  david fincher  
mr  fincher  who until now has only directed music videos and commercials  has done an incredible job here  
his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no  alien  film has before  
for mr  fincher  i see a long prosperous career ahead of him  
the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry  
elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the  alien  series been set in  
this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii  james horners aliens   
this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring  
this is a great score  
the ending to alien  is quite good  
there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up  but it played very nicely  
i will not ruin the ending for you  
go see the film  
i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season  
alien  is a worthy successor to aliens and alien  
and when they make alien   perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in
