robert benton has assembled a stellar  mature cast for his latest feature  twilight  a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood  
paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross  
harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames  gene hackman and susan sarandon   a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight  
when jack sends him on a routine delivery job  however  the old instincts kick in  
soon  harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line  and he no longer knows who to trust  
there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight  in addition to newman  hackman and sarandon  
james garner plays raymond hope  a former cop and one of harrys best friends  
stockard channing plays verna  harrys former partner  and possibly a former love interest  
reese witherspoon is mel  the distrustful daughter of the ames  and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend  
giancarlo esposito appears as harrys bumbling detective protigi  and john spencer is a suspicious police captain  
with a cast like that  its almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze  
luckily  theres more to the film than some sort of actors recognition ceremony  
twilight has a solid film noirish plot  
it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics  but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days  
the major cast members all deliver strong performances  as can be expected of their caliber  
however  none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable  
the supporting cast is enjoyable  if a little underdrawn  
stockard channings character  in particular  is a cipher  
theres more to her character than the film takes the time to describe  
its a minor  but irritating  flaw  
with a solid cast  and a good plot  theres a lot to recommend about twilight  
its biggest flaw is actually its short running time  
at a slim  minutes  theres a lot of stuff thats packed into an awfully small package  
still  the chance to see newman  sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two
