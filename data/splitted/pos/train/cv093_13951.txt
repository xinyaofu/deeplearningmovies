  footloose  has only one goal in mind  to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feelgood antics  
and i hate to admit it  i fell for it  
the movie is about a teenager  bacon  who moves to a small town from the big city  and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend  lithgow   
he ends up falling for the preachers daughter  singer  and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do  
as mentioned at the beginning of this review   footloose  is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama  
there are virtually no surprises  and the writing is secondrate  
so why did i enjoy it so much  
for one thing  the cast is great  
kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role  
were rooting for him right from the start  and  unlike most films of this genre  bacon doesnt play him as the  rebel without a clue  sort  
yes  he does rebel  but hes also polite when he needs to be  
and he never broods  
the rest of the cast is equally impressive  
john lithgow  seen here playing a normal guy for a change  is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian  
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter  
by the end of the film  we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character  
another nice touch is the music  
we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with  sexual innuendos   but thats not true at all  
the title track  performed by kenny loggins  is upbeat and fun  
during the final sequence  i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing  
of course  i soon realized that would be a little pathetic  
anyway   footloose  is a charming little surprise  
dont let the premise prevent you from watching it  
it sucked me in  and itll do the same to you
