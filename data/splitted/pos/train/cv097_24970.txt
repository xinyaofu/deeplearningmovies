for many people  procrastination isnt a problem to overcome  its a high art  
well do just about anything to put off a task  
when the deadline for this column nears  its the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and    
eventually  hopefully  sometimes  theres a breakthrough and we actually get down to work  
amazingly its almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing  that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away  
and then  the next time  we do it all again  
english professor grady tripp  michael douglas  is a master  
seven years ago  his first book was a hit  
hes been working on his second  a short page piece  since then  
fearful that he cant live up to the first  he cant bring himself to finish it  
no writers block  hes nearing    pages with no end in sight  
now hes having a particularly difficult day  
the colleges annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing their books  
during the first day  his wife has left him  his married girlfriend informs him shes pregnant and his agent is in town with a sixfoot transvestite in tow  
by the evening  our besieged writer is driving though the snowcovered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him  a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk  
this could be a pivotal point in his midlife crisis  
and then theres the next morning  
theres a lot to like about this movie  
there are no huge explosions  shattering glass or computergenerated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues  
grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career  
in the world of  what have you done for me lately    he knows his second book has to be better than his first  
instead of finding out  he drifts  comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood  
he doesnt have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer  tobey maguire   
james may be suicidal and psychotic  
certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie  
he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isnt interesting enough  
as the weekend progresses  they are both forced to fully engage life  
thats the question they must face  comfort or real experiences  
the film takes some interesting chances  
nontraditional relationships are presented as matteroffact  
extramarital  gay  interracial  professorstudent  here they arent judged  merely choices  
the actors are all firstrate  
douglas triumphs  playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled  unshaven and clad in a pink womens house robe  
maguires disengaged alienation works perfectly here  
robert downey jr  as gradys agent livens up his scenes  
director curtis hanson   l  a  
confidential   makes a few missteps  
the women are underused  
frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara  gradys married lover but we never understand much of who she is  
the chemistry between the two of them is nonexistent which makes some of the ending unconvincing  
katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor  but her character goes nowhere  
we never even see gradys exiting wife  
this is very much a guys film  
the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others  
gradys alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film  not him and sara  
as the boomers age  expect to see more midlife crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic  
eventually itll probably become cliche  but right now weve got a winner  
ill finish this in a second  
right now i have to grab some paint  
i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touchup  
  michael redman has written this column for so long that hes made midlife crisis a career choice
