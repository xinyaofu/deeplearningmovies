i think that any competent member of the human race whos ever seen a movieany moviecould probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer  
even though i try very hard to not predict films as im watching them  especially not romantic comedies   the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds  and sometimes minutes  before i actually saw it happen on screen  
but i dont care  
not even a little  
my reasons for this are simple    adam sandler is great  
  drew barrymore is great  
  the movie is so funny  
there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard  
i havent laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers  
sandler plays robby hart  a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music  
in the opening scenes  he seems like a happygolucky wedding singer  at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual  steve buscemi  who decides that his brothers wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life  up to that point  was utter pointlessness  
a week later  at his own wedding  he is left standing at the altar by his exfianc  e  linda  angela featherstone   
with his life in complete disarray  he meets julia  barrymore   a waitress  
she is engaged to glenn  matthew glave   and is to marry him in about three months  
julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans  
soon  and predictably  it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk  and that robby and julia really love each other  
oh sure  its trite  
and if anyone making this film expected us to  like  feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer  then they truly underestimated their audience  
what makes the story bearable  aside from the terrific costumes and s music  are the performances  
barrymore is simply adorable here  ive never seen her look so close to the way she did in et   
not only is she pleasant to look at  but her acting job here really is a good oneand it doesnt hurt that the character is likable and adequately wellwritten  
and the jerk  played in fullforce by graves  is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy ive ever seen  
naturally  the true star here is sandler  
i think the guy is flatout hilarious  
he can say something that just isnt funny  and his delivery makes me laugh  
his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore  but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can  indeed  hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy  
whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler  the wedding singer gives him a character that  for the first time  he actually has to fit into  
as far as im concerned he succeeded  and this film is testimony that he does  in fact  have some range in his talents  
and the movie is just so funny  
perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc  e abandoned him  
this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air  
and while the film  like all romantic comedies  takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up  there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half  
my formal complaints for the wedding singer arent very important  
the film is predicable  but who cares  
the characters are extremely likable  the movie is ridiculously funny  and the experience is simply enjoyable  
in addition to this  i cant imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film  
in that order  i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review  
i just want everyone to know that i laughed  
a lot
