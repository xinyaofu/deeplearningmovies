on rewatching italian writerdirector dario argentos much lauded murder mystery tenebrae  i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  
in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles  but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his  giallo  murder mysteries  
while its certainly not perfect  repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal  anthony franciosa  where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book  tenebrae   
with the police on his back for leads  he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  
he brings grace  charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding reallife horror around him  
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  
argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral  ambivalent  shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  
tenebrae is perhaps the most multilayered of argentos scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep redprofondo rosso  the fulllength italian language version  and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  
needless to say for argento fans  there is no denying the directors brilliance as a stylist  
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  
they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light  rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  
instead  tenebraes set design and lighting paints a sleek  clinical  chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  
and the soundtracks mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  
so tenebrae has much to recommend it  no question  
still  constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  
some critics argue that logic doesnt matter in argento films  but damnit  it matters in all films to the point where viewers dont deserve to feel cheated  
by the way  if you dont want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs  
about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which  properly handled  could have proved ingenious  
we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who  we later discover  is none other than the author peter neal  
he is insane  apparently  
the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides its time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife  
he is finally revealed to us as this  second killer  in the films bloody climax  
but argento muffs the twist  both technically and narratively  
you see  we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killers house  
but thanks to poor editing  its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway  
bad cutting puts the timing way out  
in other words  hes almost in two places at once  
during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring  
by the films end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have selfinflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant  
the injury  
he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock  
thus  the revelation of the  hero  as a killer  and antihero  in the final scenes may still prove shocking  but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled  
helpfully  in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along  
but there too is a problem  as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least  
the story owes us a better understanding of franciosas mind  his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage  
tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies  
for instance  a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike  
we would assume the rider is the same boy  but it turns out to be some male character we arent even introduced too  
thats careless filmmaking  pure and simple  
why  you may ask  do i go on about the storys flaws  
because when it comes to visuals and set pieces  argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world  
take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae  
an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where  almost unbelievably  it jumps a high fence and chases her across town  
finally  as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine  she accidentally stumbles on the serial killers lair  
its an absolutely masterful sequence  tense and exciting  and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone  
and thats exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating  
too often  it seems  argentos films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts  
mind you  if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look  
and if youre a fan of argentos unique style of giallo thriller then its essential  
see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli  
its a stylish  greatlooking and quirky film despite the problem narrative  
a shame  because it doesnt have to be that way  
take argentos more recent stendhal syndrome     where with the aid of cowriter franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache  
proof that he can do it  if he tries
