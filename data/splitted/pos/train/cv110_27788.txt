plot  a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention  
the boys eventually get together to split the money  but as plans change  doublecrosses occur  dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road  
whos on the up and up  whos the real bad guy and whos gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie  
critique  the funnest movie that ive seen so far this year  
its got style  its got tough guys talkin shite and its got plenty of bullets to go around  
a definite hunkahunka burnin adventure  
a guys guy movie through and through  and one thatll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff  
its not very original  it goes on for a little too long  but costner and russell make it happen  as two shitekickin elvis lovers  who dont stop till they  more or less  drop  
this movies got some pretty intensive shootout scenes  one of the coolest robbery scenarios that ive ever witnessed  featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the kings music playing in the background  and a decent helping of doublecrosses  sharp dialogue and funny moments  
in fact  even though the cast is filled with many name actors  bactors as they might be for the most part   most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim  
but the true glue that holds this film together  other than the spirit of elvis himself  is costner and russell  who play their badass characters to the t  sure  russells been down this road before  but costner surprised me with his nastiness  
i guess hes pissed at all the boxoffice bombs that hes been in of late  but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here  
in the end  the bottom line with this movie is having fun  kickin ass and making sure theres enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards  
and smoke em if you got em  folks  
there is also this one really great showdown scene between costner and a cop  thatll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time  
the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack thatll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next  
it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background  with plenty  and i mean plenty  of camera tricks  cuts and edits  but for this kind of flick  it actually works  
the film is not perfect though  it starts off with a pretty big bang  but then pulls a way of the gun on us  and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle  while characters intermingle and disperse  
i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots  and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well  
and did i mention that courteney cox looked megahot in the movie  
no    okay  
well i just did  
i coulda done without her whole  romance  angle  but to be honest  it doesnt take up much of the film  which is generally covered in blood  explosions  guts and elvis nods  
try to see how many  inside  connections to the king you can guess  
of course  its no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind  
i also like these types of  guy  movies a lot  and even though the film doesnt bring much originality to the table  it does offer a pretty coherent story  some nice twists and turns  humor and a big ol helping of whoopass coming straight from costner and russells respective boots  
probably not a film for everyone  but definitely for those who enjoy the guns  the charismatic bad guys and a fun  if entirely disposable  adventure  
now see how many elvis songs ive used to pun my way through this phony review below  
the elvis songs also recommend this movie  
so whether youre lonesome tonight or any other night  remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets  leave your little sister at home  bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse  cause this movie aint one to return to the sender  
i really beg of you  whether youre stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel  to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender  
and no suspicious minds either  folks  cause i got stung by this movie  i mean it really shook me up  and unless youre the devil in disguise himself  i think you wont be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either  
so dont be cruel  dont turn away  dont curl up with your latest flame tonite  whether she be a hardheaded woman or not  and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film  
its now or never  folks  
trust me  i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that id seen so far this year is far behind me  
joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building  
thank you    thank 
you very much
