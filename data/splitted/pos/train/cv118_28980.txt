plot  a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes  
he is taken prisoner along with some other humans  and tries his best to escape his simian captors  
oh yeah  and did i mention that the apes can talk  
kewl  
critique  despite this film not looking like a  tim burton movie  or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself  i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun  summer fare  
although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape makeup jobs and characterizations  
i mean  i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real  
i also have to  give it up  to all of the actors inside the costumes  not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get makeup slobbered all over them for  hours  but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well  
i especially enjoyed bonham carters performance  who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film  human or ape  and tim roths bad guy  who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part  
plotwise  i liked the beginning of the film  the whole buildup once wahlberg got into the village  the escape and most of the fight scenes  but once things got out into the deserted area  and the final battle sequence   i kinda lost a bit of my interest  
i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of  human beings as animals  then i was about the end battle sequence  which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film  
i also hated the  kid  character who just got on my nerves and didnt really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved  i wont ruin it here but cmon guys    you 
coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that  no    
but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character  his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his interspecies love interests  
this dude didnt seem to give a rats ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didnt really care about what happened to him either  
now im not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script  but the film suffered because of it  
visually  the movie was also nice to look at  especially the apes    but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton  
the  surprise ending  that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in   felt a little tacked on here  and despite being interesting  didnt really make all that much sense to me  unless you look at it from a sequel point of view   
so overall  i loved the whole  feel  of the planet  the apes that ruled it  the manner in which they treated the humans  screamed  shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain  but didnt appreciate the films lack of human character development  why was kris kristofferson even in this movie   and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring  
but i would still recommend this film as a fun  summer movie with laughs  creepiness and a really cool premise  
ps  for anyone who has seen the original  i cannot believe that they didnt at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character  in this case  mark wahlberg  goes nuts at the world in which hes suddenly been thrust   this is a mad house    
type of thing   
the guy in this film barely seems to be  put off  by the fact that hes surrounded by apes who can speak english   
wheres joblo coming from  
the arrival     battlefield earth     godzilla     instinct     mission to mars     pitch black        planet of the apes     sleepy hollow
