disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched  
to see a disaster film with actual originality  or at least a decent plot twist  would definitely be a welcome surprise  
unfortunately  folks  its not likely  
dantes peak is cliched  and at times corny  but also pretty decent  
to be honest  i wasnt very interested in seeing this film  and word of mouth  as well as several reviews  didnt make it sound promising  
so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasnt bad at all  
its pretty run of the mill  but its not something i would say is merely  ok  to watch  
in case you dont know  dantes peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in its shadow  dantes peak  who wouldve guessed  eh    
pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and  perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof  is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future  
due to the lack of more substantial evidence  nobody warns the small town  and when they finally do  its in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows  
brosnan  all around good guy  will  of course  save the day  
  
  
or at least the mayor of dantes peak  linda hamilton   
naturally the two will become infatuated with one another  
  if you think i just ruined a plot development  you havent seen very many movies   
theres also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings  
and of course  the kids or the dog  at least one or the other  will do something heroic  
  
  
but hey  i dont want to ruin all the surprises  
if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dantes peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time  i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself  
its not brain food  but it succeeds at what its meant to be  
  
  
an enjoyable  suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash
