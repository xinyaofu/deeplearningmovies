on the whole  how to make an american quilt is a nicelyunderstated drama that has a lot to say about love  passion  and monogamy in relationships

the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees  
if theres a disappointment here  its that the script doesnt have more resonance  but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional
