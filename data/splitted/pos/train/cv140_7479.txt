the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now   it mut be found   
so what  exactly  is the fifth element  
after seeing luc bessons ambitious  muchshroudedinsecrecy science fiction fantasy  i could not help but be let down by the actual answer  which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think  
but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole  a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films docreate a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen  
the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wrapsthe actual storylineis the most conventional  dismayingly so  element  pun intended  of the film  
speaking in the vaguest possible terms  the basics of the plot are as follows  in the year   a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth  and only the four elementsearth  wind  fire  and waterunited with a fifth element can stop it  
figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas  bruce willis   a shady  southerndrawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg  the hilariously hammy gary oldman  picking up where he left off in bessons the professional   a priest  ian holm   and a mysterious creature named leeloo  milla jovovich   
all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelmingand unsurprisingfashion  but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest  
what remains interesting and exciting  however  after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil  director of photography thierry arbogast  visual effects supervisor mark stetson  and the crew at digital domain  
the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last  
the frenzied cityscape of new york  with its vibrant dayglo colors  tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds  and the swarm of cars  cabs  and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways  is absolutely breathtaking to behold  especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film  
but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings werent equally as interesting  and are they ever  
in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world  from bulky robots to doglike mangalores  the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jeanpaul gaulthier  best known for creating madonnas pointy bustier getup in her blonde ambition tour  
gaulthiers outlandish creations  such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps  feel more at home in bessons futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world  they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film  
while bessons bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film  it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience  
for all its imagination  certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre  
i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film  ruby rhod  chris tucker   a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservativehe makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress  sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer  speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed  
at first this characters hyper energy is funny  but the act wears out its welcome very quickly  
not irritating  but just as strange  is a musical number by blueskinned alien chanteuse diva  maiwenn lebesco   who singsand dancesan aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno  
the tune  as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serras innovative score  is haunting  but it is also completely jarring  
then there are the campy touches of humor besson and coscripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout  which too often are silly and forced  a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny  to boot  
the storys weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element  
while still visually and aurally spectacular  the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be  
the big  serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers  and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward  
as such  at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here  that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters  
this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself  who told me in the lobby following the screening  imagine that  the filmmaker watching the film with the  enemy  the critics  that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second halfnow titled mr  shadowis still waiting to be made  
still  despite the story problems  the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson  rarely does a filmmakers original vision come to the screen in all its audacious  undiluted glory  
it is a fascinating example of how of one artists fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams
