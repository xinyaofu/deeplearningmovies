this remake of  la cage aux folles  features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their sons future inlaws  
the couple  robin williams and nathan lane  are about as archetypal  or as the less kind might put it  stereotypical  gays possible  
williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star  
they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode  
williams is excellent as should be no surprise  
gene hackman as rightwing potential fatherinlaw is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles  
the real star is lane  
his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straightshooting uncle is hilarious  
perhaps it is a personal failing on my part  but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it  
luckily  for me at least   it doesnt last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men  their son and the deception  
the question of stereotypes is a touchy one  
these guys personify the homophobic gay image  
you can almost hear the swishing  
if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world  youll be outraged  
but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals  youll love it  
your choice
