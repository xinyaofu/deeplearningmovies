in recent years  harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence  scowling through the likes of tom clancys jack ryan series  thefugitive  and last years smash airforceone  that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system  
apparently  it was just lying dormant  
with ivan reitmans enjoyable romantic comedyadventure sixdays  sevennights  the lovable scoundrel is back  giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons  
ford plays quinn harris  a carefree and slightly slobby  endearingly so  pilot in the tropics whose brokendown plane crashes in a storm  stranding him and his charter  new york magazine editor robin monroe  anne heche   on a deserted island  
of course  the sophisticated robin and the saltoftheearth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down  and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting  
while some of the lines fall flat  the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche  
both actors  who have largely done serious works as of late  seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders  and they deliver their zingers  as weak as they sometimes are  with beguiling abandon  
naturally  theres nothing like a lifethreatening crisis to bring two people together  and quinn and robins warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates  
granted  some conflict needed to be introduced on the island  but this tackedon development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes  
but the point is to get the two together  and their newfound affection causes complications for both  but mostly robin  who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank  david schwimmer   who frantically awaits her return on the home island  
reitman  and old  reliable hand at breezy comedies  keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more actionoriented sequences  
his big accomplishment  however  is bringing the old  smiling ford back  
as appealing and charismatic as he always is  ford hasnt been quite this charming and affable in years  hes obviously having a blast  and the audience cannot help but have one along with him  
holding her own is heche  whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be  as the plane goes down  she frantically pops stress pills   
she can take her lumps  physical and otherwise  just as well as quinn  making her a formidable foil and ideal match  
formulaic and light as a feather  sixdays  sevennights could be cited as a classic example of the summer  popcorn  movie seasons lack of substance  
its certainly fluff  but its unpretentious  undemanding  andmost importantlyfun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach  
pass the popcorn
