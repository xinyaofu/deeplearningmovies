synopsis  in this cultural exploration  a chinese american computer engineer named fang  peter wang  decides to take a monthlong vacation to visit his sister mrs  chao  shen guanglan   her husband mr  chao  hy xiaoguang   and their teenage daughter lili  li qinqin  in beijing after  years of separation  
fang brings his asian american wife grace  sharon iwai  and his collegeaged son paul  kelvin han yee  along  both of whom dont speak chinese  
the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters  
opinion  sometimes a film is plot driven  
sometimes its a character sketch  
a great wall    can be called a culture sketch  as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family  
fangs family is thoroughly americanized  
fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss  
his wife cant cook chinese  
his son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl  
meanwhile fangs beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the work unit   
her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity  homosexuals running the streets   and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life  
the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other  
there is no ultimate answer or final comprehensive understanding after the monthlong vacation  
the film is neither here nor there  its a neutral  meandering  gentle  portrait of life on both sides
