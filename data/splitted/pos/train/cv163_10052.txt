note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
its startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth  
the lion king had just cracked  million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history  continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast  
since then  though  disneys animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns  with pocahontas  the hunchback of notre dame  and this years hercules successively proving less and less potent  
with the once seeminglyimpregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable  and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from foxs anastasia  disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation  the little mermaid  
while the animation for the film is  as is typically the case for disney films  unquestionably topnotch  the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation  but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music  
the films storyline is fairly straightforward  young teen falls for handsome man  father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter  teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man  except in this case  the chaperone is a crab  the teen is a young mermaid  and the object of her desire is a human prince  
what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions  
from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric  shes resolutely smitten  and shes such a pure and endearing character that one cant help but invest their heart with her  
this simple but touching love story  coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour  makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture  
one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it  the voices cast for its motley crew of characters  
this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue  which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams muchheralded turn in aladdin  by the release of the lion king and henceforth  the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities  
while its understandable that animated features lacking the namerecognition or drawing power of disney  say  baltos use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda  or even anastasias showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack  would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products  its unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy  
do we really need to hear  say  demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame  
is the films entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice  rather than a voice which best suits the role  
  im not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan   
fortunately  the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid  although perhaps more obscure  are impeccably cast  
chief among them is jodi benson  a  tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you  who voices the films heroine ariel to perfection  with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor  and gorgeous singing voice  ms  benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film  
  shes the only reason id even consider catching flubber   
similarly  samuel e  wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian  the weary guardian crab  
he easily milks his lovable characters comic moments for all theyre worth  and his rendering of two of the little mermaids big tunes   under the sea  and  kiss the girl   have become the stuff of legend  
pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil seawitch ursula  while kenneth mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariels father  king triton  
in large roles and small  edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal  and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef   the little mermaid is impeccably cast  
of course  the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken  music  and howard ashman  lyrics   who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr  ashmans untimely death  
not only are mr  menkens tunes unbearably catchy  but mr  ashmans charming lyrics are fully integrated into the films storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the characters dialogue  and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film  
mr  menkens score for the film is equally topnotch  the sequence where eric  voiced by christopher daniel barnes  and ariel tour his kingdom in a horsedrawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr  menkens fine score  
it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypsostyled  under the sea  as joyfully crooned by mr  wright  which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song  indeed  one of the many little joys in screening the film during its rerelease was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune  but my favourite is ms  bensons heartfelt rendition of the ballad  part of your world   an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope  wonderfully lyricized by mr  ashman  which  accompanied by the films most dazzlingly polished animation sequence  packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes  
during the songs reprise  which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in  the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking  and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history  
as of this writing  november  has come to an end  as has disneys limited day rerelease of the little mermaid  
theres no question that the primary motivation for  if not the films reissue itself  at least its timing  was to reinforce disneys dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to foxs costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture  anastasia  
in every respect  the rerelease of the little mermaid appears to be a success  the films  grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic  million mark  the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video  pulling in close to  million in its opening weekend  and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressivelymarketed anastasia in headtohead competition  it siphoned enough from the fox films opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot  allowing for disneys odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away  
but although disneys motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were selfserving and protectionist  the real winner is the public  
any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one  and its a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen  
the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disneys modern animation renaissance  and one of the greatest animated films ever made
