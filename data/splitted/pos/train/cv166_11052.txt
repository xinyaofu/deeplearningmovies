contact is the  movie ive seen the most  five times to be exact  
four of those times were on the big screen  but even on a tv  its a very impressive film  
the same cant be said for films like independance day  but thats because contact is a rare example in scifi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects  and all of us know looking back that id didnt offer much outside of some onetime delightful eye candy  
contacts wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway  jodie foster   a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of  merely listening  to sounds out in space  
her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age  encouraged by her loving father  ted  david morse   who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola  fl  that was  of course  before the days of internet chat rooms   
while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence  of which the program seti is an acronym for   ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on  keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive  
ellies strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist  a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young  
in puerto rico  she meets palmer joss  matthew mcconaughey   a writer examining the effects of technology on the worlds overall happiness  a one time seminary student who describes himself as  a man of the cloth  without the cloth   
despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a  supreme being   ellie and palmer hit it off  and even take the time to sleep together  
its a weak and hurried relationship  but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on  
meanwhile  dr  david drumlin  tom skerritt   who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money  is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding  
this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors  eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation  and only a one night stand to remember  
it is in this nm city where  several months later  ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space  perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science  
when the signal is closely examined  many new developments spring up  and before long  drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at  
eventually  it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega  where the signal seems to have originated   
the media swarms  fanatics go further off the deep end  scientists clamor for new information  politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take  and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality  remember when zemeckis couldnt get enough of this in forrest gump    
as if that werent enough  ellies discovery leads her to the nations capital where she again runs into palmer  
contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs  religion  
the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented  with no signs of bias  
arguments for both sides are intelligent  solid  and thoughtprovoking  
when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega  of which ellie is a leading candidate   personal convictions play a more important role than love interests  
the question is  can a person who doesnt believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when  of the planet  does  believe in a higher power  
even when the film wraps up  its uncertain whether its meant to play as an advocate for religion  science  both  or even neither  and in our modern day society where  right and wrong  is only opinion  at least speaking  politically correctly    the ambiguity is an incentive  
dont get me wrong  
as much as it sounds like it  contact isnt merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film  
its a  highly  enjoyable two and a half hours  
despite its seemingly heavy issues  its not a tedious undertaking to watch this film  
the special effects are outstanding  though  warning   
highly depreciated on the small screen  
even so  some of the subtle visual effects  that will likely go unnoticed by many  are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as  scifi   
the storytelling is rich and complete  and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious  and at times  even hokey   its easily one of the best  films  and one of the best scifi films ive ever seen  
this is zemeckis best since back to the future  and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated  zemeckis now has real reason to boast
