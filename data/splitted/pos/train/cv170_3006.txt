i dont know what movie the critics saw  but it wasnt this one  
the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring  
in my personal opinion  they couldnt be more wrong  
if you were expecting airplane  like 
laughs and agatha christieintense mystery  then yes  this movie would be a disappointment  
however  if youre just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time  this is one to see  
honest  it is  
this story is about a th network  wbn  taking to americas airwaves in   
penny henderson  mary stuart masterson   the station owners secretary  must deal with her overbearing boss  an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moments notice  partly due to the fact that they havent been paid in weeks  
among the mayhem  she must also deal with her soontobe exhusband  roger  brian benben  who desperately wants her back  
unfortunately  her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation  
while trying to woo penny back  roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn  
mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny  im trying to be unbiased so i wont tell you how amazing she looked   although brian benben gets most of the screen time  
along with the two leads  are several recognizable faces  including corbin bernsen  l  a  
law   michael mckean  laverne  shirley  and bobcat goldthwait  
the special effects are amazing  and fooled me  which some may argue isnt very difficult to do  in many scenes  
although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy  it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie  
overall  i gave it  or an  depending on what system you use
