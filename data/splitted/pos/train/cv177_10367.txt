  oh my god  i sounded just like a mother   
mrs  pascal  played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold  tells her son  
  didnt i sound just like a mother   
  you are a mother   her son marty tells her disgustedly  
  i know  but i still cant believe it  
i look at you people and wonder  how did you ever fit in my womb   
marty  you see  is a grownup twin  
although his sister  who thinks she is jackieo  is certifiably insane  marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes  
mother and daughter  played in a brilliant performance by parker posey  are both varying degrees of wacko  
most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and meanspirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is  
the daughters fantasy of being jackieo is probably the most sane part of her being  
mrs  pascal is the sort that will not let jackieo keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level  
she explains to martys new fiancee  lesly  tori spelling   soon after their first meeting that jackieo was holding martys private part when she came out of the womb  
the dialog by wendy macleod  based on the play by mark waters  is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment  
the script  reminiscent of a david mamet play  flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters  
the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the familys out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane  
in this storm are two sane individuals  
the fiancee is a giddy  schoolgirl type  embarrassed by everything  a complete contrast to her rival jackieos bitter pseudosophistication  
as the two twins younger brother  anthony  freddie prinze jr  plays the allamerica boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brothers fiancee that night  
  we all have our secrets   jackieo tells her potential sisterinlaw  and boy  does she have a few  
this is a house filled with them  
  when lesly calls it the familys  home  to mrs  pascal  theyve never had a visitor before lesly  mrs  pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their  house    
in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase   made for each other   the twins biggest  but not their only secret  is that theyve had a longterm incestuous relationship  
they dont like to discuss it  although they are not particularly ashamed of it  
perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy  this story never pulls its punches  
jackieo tries in many ways  few subtle  to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his  
in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackieo pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands  
marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy  
the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing  
they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world  
their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best  
director mark waters keeps the shows energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace  
his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it  
jackieo is temperamentally incapable of being nice  
and being jealous  she cuts lesly down mercilessly  
  were you poor   
jackieo asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished  
  did you eat pies  
chicken pot pies   
  pancakes actually  lots of pancakes   lesly replies with her usual sincerity  
  a donut king  so is she like the queen    
jackieo cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king  
  are we entertaining royalty   
with rolfe kents whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed  
will it end in a big emotional explosion  a murder  people slowly cutting each other up with words  a familial catharsis  a weather disaster or what  
the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere  and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell  
ill not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise  
the house of yes runs a blazing fast     
it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations  mature themes  violent overtones and some profanity  
the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers  i  e   treat the movie as it were rated nc
