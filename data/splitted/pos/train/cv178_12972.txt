i dont know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people  but its something i used to wonder about when i was younger  
i cant decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat  but im pretty sure andrew niccol  screenwriter for the truman show  has had the same curious thought  
the truman show is about a man  jim carrey  whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public  
since birth  hes been living in the fictional island town of seahaven  fla   which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign  
all the people in truman burbanks life are actors  and the anonymous townfolk paid extras  
people watch trumans life  hours a day  live  with no commercial interruptions  
revenue comes instead from product placement  a staple of contemporary hollywood  with trumans friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones  
the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else  
even if you havent seen the truman show  youve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials  the trailer and other promotion blitzes  
if anything ive written so far is a surprise to you  then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news  
either way  you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it  because otherwise youll probably think it sucks  
it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror  reciting the crucial  eat me  scene from alive  wishing his neighbors a good day  afternoon and evening  and living in domestic bliss with his wife  laura linney   
but weird things start happening  
a stage light comes falling out of the sky  truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father  
we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child  sailing through a rainstorm  
the death was staged by director christof  ed harris   who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island  
similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth  not the least of them trumans best friend marlon  noah emmerich   who assures him hes not in on any conspiracy because the last thing hed ever do is hurt him  
as trumans trusting eyes tear over  christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else  
theres even a daily behindthescenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of trumans existence  
the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama  because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions  
and it all hinges on carrey  who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on  
hes come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura  
most fundamentally  its just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a persons life without the person realizing it  how they coordinate extras  hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors  
the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this  
sure  the most interesting tv genre of the s has been reality programming and jerry springers popularity is through the roof  but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves  
and when news shows use hidden cameras  its done in the name of the greater good  not entertainment  
but merge the two and youve got the truman show  
right now  its implausible  i mean  the fcc wont let you say the sword on the air  do you think theyd let you broadcast every detail of a mans life to the entire world without his consent  
one day  though  it could happen  
and  even though it would mean the end of privacy  people would eat it up  
you know they would
