plot  jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy  
but one thing leads to another  and the next thing you know  lis being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working  
a lot of asskicking  facewhippings  gun fights and    okay  a little more asskicking ensues  
critique  very cool  
now heres a movie that gives you exactly what youre looking for  if what youre looking for is kickass action  a palpable good copbad cop story line  some hardcore stunts and jet li slamdunking everyone in sight  
the film also moves fast  a mere  minutes   develops a certain  cute  chemistry between fonda and li  has nice surroundings  paris  baby   and gives us one of the best bad guys that ive seen all year  
tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film  
he is pure evil  
they should have called this movie bad lieutenant  as keitel has nothing on this man  
what a great  great monster  
my favorite line of tchekys was when li was explaining the whole  kiss of the dragon  thing to him and he cut him off by saying  kiss my ass   
pure action movie poetry  
anyway  other than him  jet li also handled his  acting  pretty well in this film  with very little real dialogue to say  but enough to make us believe his character  
actually  just looking into the mans eyes generally tells you a lot  
fonda was also pretty good  despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time  but i still felt kinda bad for her  so i guess she did her job okay  
but in the end  nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances  
we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side  and this film delivers gangbusters on that front  
and yes    they have no wirefu in this movie    i 
say again    no 
wirework  no bullshit stunts with li floating around in midair for over a minute  
its all straight action  fist to fist  boot to face and all around cool stunts  
if thats what youre looking for  i dont see how you will be disappointed with this film  
yes  its not very original in plot  just take luc bessons own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila    does have an annoying hiphoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while  i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang     and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief  rolling their eyes all over the place  
but was i entertained  
thoroughly  
does the film feature more gunplay  martial arts and overthetop kills that most recent action flicks  
yes  again  
does this sound interesting to you  
well  the answer to that question is entirely up to you  
one thing that i would definitely recommend is  as jet li pointed out himself on his website  that you leave the kids at home for this one  
in fact  you might even wanna leave yourself if you cant handle the more violent of sequences  
all in all  a rippin  roarin fun time  
wheres joblo coming from  
black mask     blade     la femme nikita     lethal weapon      the matrix     the professional     romeo must die     rush hour     shanghai noon
