there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie  
action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences  while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything fullcircle  
for fans of both genres  however  realism is key  
action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic  and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movies end  
on this advice  director john frankenheimer  the island of dr  
moreau  strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller  ronin  
the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing  considering the fare thats fallen into the same category over the last few years  
the script  written by j  d  zeik in his bigscreen debut  approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission  impossible two years ago  
a certain number of people will be lost by this  but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times  
frankenheimer masters the script with poise  and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of postcold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck  
his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here  and ronin becomes a better movie because of it  
robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time  
he takes command and offers much gravity as the exspy sam  a man whos called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre  natascha mcelhone  recover a package  
the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast  especially once the requisite doublecrossing begins  and its role is skillfully penned by zeik  
at times  however  zeiks tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission  impossible  de niro might easily become tom cruise  the package might become cruises computer disk  
fortunately  the focus here is almost entirely on the package  whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the doublecross and why it happened  
the action content is impressive  and it lives up to the hints given in previews  
the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect fullblown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness  
ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish  but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots  
the suspense tapers off considerably by the end  a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movies open  
considering these factors its good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well  and its another good bet this month  
since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months  its definitely worth the visit
