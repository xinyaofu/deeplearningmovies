being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it   shall we dance  wont be seen by that many people  
and thats a shame  this is a funny  enchanting  and goofy movie full of laughs  surprises  and wonderful dance sequences  
the surprising thing about  shall we dance  is the universal appeal of the story  
a us version is in the works  and its no wonder  its not really all that culture specific  
although there is a narrated setup that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings  about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing   the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isnt at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film  
the only important unexplained japanesespecific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that  yen is roughly   when you see the film  and you should see this film  youll know why   
a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life  a house  a child  and good marriage  still doesnt translate into a fulfilled life  
after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work  sugiyana  koji yakusho  decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself  
after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai  tamiyo kusakari  too rich for his blood  sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her  
we then meet the players in this gem of a movie  who all have their own reasons for joining the class  
later on  we meet aoki at the dance studio  naoto takenaka   a coworker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film  
the story  laughs  and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along  
its a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances  
its difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much  the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters  and in the end  each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater  
its one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore  no big plot  no special effects  no gunplay  no tragic consequences  no forced examinations of the nature of love  and no insights into the nature of evil  
just a warm  funny  endearing film that will charm the pants off of you  
when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside  
  shall we dance  will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste
