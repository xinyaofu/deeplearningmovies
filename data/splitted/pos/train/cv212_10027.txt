ingredients  neophyte lawyer  legal situations  corrupt insurance company  
synopsis  rudy baylor  matt damon  is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time  
rudys girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband  rudys elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded  and  the family of rudys friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldnt pay for a bone marrow transplant  
rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned  but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser  danny devito  who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge  danny glover   
jon voight plays leo f  drummond  the intimidating and arrogant leader of the allpowerful insurance companys team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice  
will rudy defeat leo  
will he enjoy being a lawyer  
opinion  the good news is that this movie has a happy ending  and it features a guy trying to do the right thing  
director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie  
in the typical lawyer movie theres one big case and the movie focuses on solving it  and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins  after lots of gripping courtroom drama   
however  coppolas movie is deliberately more low key  
the rainmaker plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters  
in the background rudys voice narrates his feelings and makes halfcynical jokes about the legal profession in general  
two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be  
first  rudys time is split juggling three cases  rather than concentrating on a single highstakes case  
also  rudys use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge  
the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win  and rudy narrates his way into coming of age
