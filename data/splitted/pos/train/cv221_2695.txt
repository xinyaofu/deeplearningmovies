expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a featurelength film and youve got babys day outan agreeably amusing childrens comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant  
the plot tracks a trio of crooksposedasphotographers  mantegna  pantoliano  haley  who steal ninemonthold bennington august cottwell iv  aka baby bink  from his oldmoney home  
but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago  
following the path of his favorite story  called  babys day out   baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site  
while baby stays unscathed  the crooks fare worse for the wear  
the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and  of course  suffer multiple crotch injuries  
  john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one   
like he did in planes  trains  and automobiles  john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple setup and extended execution  
here  hes aided and abetted by a director  patrick read johnson  whose choreography could rival a coen brother  
best bit  baby crawling across a busy city street  
babys day out has only two emotionsawww and ouchand the actors play them accordingly  
forget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon  disposable as mom and nanny  respectively  the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing  
joe mantegna is a great head stooge  barking lines like  that little doodoo machine is my retirement money   
brian haley has a great scene with a gorilla  while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegnas moe  
  he  is funny  
needless to say  twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief
