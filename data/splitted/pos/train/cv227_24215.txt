the  submarine  genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is  
think about it    
these films are completely based in reality  yet only a handful of people have ever been on one  making them fascinating to the general public  
they arent like movies that take place on a plane or a train  as anybody can get on one of those  
and they arent like movies that happen in outer space either  because no ones done any of that stuff yet  
when a new one comes out  you dont hear anyone say  ugh  another submarine movie  like people tend to say  ugh  another boxing movie   
look at modern movies that involve submarines  das boot  the abyss  the hunt for red october  crimson tide    
all are well regarded as topnotch entertainment  
gladly joining that bunch is u  which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u  s  naval submarine during world war ii  
we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior  bill paxton   
mcconaugheys crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma  a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence  
the mission goes horribly wrong however  and as a result  mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew  as well as a captured german  become trapped aboard the u in enemy waters  
the first great thing about u is the films opening sequence  
the german crew of u are under attack  which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion  
its tense  exciting and fascinating  
and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles  
most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away  
once the plot gets moving  u gives us action sequence after action sequence  making the audience wonder  ok  now how do they get out of this    
the stakes keep raising  much like in executive decision  an excellent actionthriller   and even though the audience knows how the film will end  its a lot of fun getting there  
i only have two minor complaints about the entire film  
the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence  
while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going  which they do   i feel as though it could have been done much quicker  and less conventionally  
i mean  did we really have to see the ships crew at a wedding  
because of that  you now know exactly whats going to happen to the groom  
my other gripe would be during the films finale  
theres an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the presidents plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one  
i cannot stress this enough    
until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect  stick with using models  
yes  u is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you  that couldnt happen   but the overall point of this film is entertainment  
it succeeds fantastically
