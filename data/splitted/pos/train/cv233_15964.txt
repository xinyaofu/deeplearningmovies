  a bugs life  may not be  toy story   but its more close than  antz  was  
i really liked  antz   basically because  yes  it is clever and witty and intelligent  and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead  perhaps the years most inspired casting   but there was  in fact  something missing from it  and im the first to admit that  
maybe its that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun  its too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging  and if it werent for woody allen  it would have been just a really clever goodnotgreat flick  
  a bugs life  has a similar premise  and it also has disney to insure that its grated and not totally over kids heads like  antz  was  not a bad thing  believe me   but what it also has is a tone thats completely innocent even when its also remaining perpetually clever  
  antz  is still the more witty film  and i love it for it  and  a bugs life  is more for general consumption  but its also more entertaining  
it broadens its horizons  and when it really moves from the ant colony  it really shows us a whole new world weve never seen before  and its take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in  antz   
its also light and clever  
the visuals are  instead of earth tones  bright worldly colors  and still gives the amazing visual technology of  antz  at least a worthy contender  
the characters are also nicely realized  though watereddown for broad consumption  they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films  
the lead character  flik  voiced by dave foley   is nothing more than a slightlyless neurotic z from  antz   but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z  instead of gene hackman playing the villain  we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper  the nicelytitled hopper  
and for the romantic lead  we dont get spacey sharon stone  but intelligent and hardtoget julialouis dreyfuss  who doesnt even come around until the very final frames  
not that the plots really any better than the one in  antz   its basically yet another redux of  the seven samurai   with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else  
when flik  a bone fide inventor  creates a timeconserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the seasons donation  he puts them all in risk  and is sent away so that he wont screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers  
he runs into a group of  warrirors  who are  unbeknownst to him  a group of carnival bugs  and they agree to help under similar false pretenses  
these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in  toy story   foppish walking stick slim  david hydepierce   german caterpillar heimlich  joe ranft   quicktempered and insecure male ladybug francis  denis leary   pretentious praying mantis manny  jonathan harris   his assistant butterfly hypsy  madeliene kahn   spider rosie  bonnie hunt   and two fleas  tuck and roll  michael mcshane   who speak in undiscernable jibberish  
the writers lightly touch on each bugs place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can  and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats  
grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake  
a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat  whose usual mildmannered squeal is a scream of death  
the bug city is a modernday metropolis  complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb  holding out a cup  with a sign lying next to him that says  kid tore off wings   
and a rainstorm is like a giant flood  with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour  
around this  the pixar animators stage several large set pieces  like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year  and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end  a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket  
meanwhile  each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting  something  antz  couldnt do  and by the end  over the end credits   a bugs life  pulls its final punch  out clevering  antz  with a series of incessantly hilarious fauxbloopers that come just at the right time  when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left  and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full moneys worth of entertainment  
still  its no  toy story   
that film  maybe above any animated film ive ever seen  encompassed almost true perfection in story  character  and wit  
it proved that it didnt need to brag about its cutting edge technology to really soar  its the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far  but is still the most satisfying   and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun  
yet  a bugs life   as well as  antz   are still amazing films  and prove without doubt  that if youre gonna make a computer animated film  send it to the guys who created these three flicks  evne if theyre not working under the same roof
