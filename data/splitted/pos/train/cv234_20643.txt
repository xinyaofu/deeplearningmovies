when i saw the trailer for  the sixth sense   i didnt expect much from it  
my snap judgment was that it was a watereddown version of  the shining  or possibly a lateentry in the glut of angelrelated moviestv shows of a couple years ago  
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot  
it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year  
bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe  
at the beginning of the movie  he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work  but he is soon confronted by vincent  a patient malcolm failed years earlier  donnie wahlbergformer new kidin an impressive cameo   
a year passes  and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed  
cole sear  haley joel osment  is a withdrawn kid who is called  freak  by the other boys in the neighborhood  
weird things seem to happen around colehis mother  olivia williams  leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasnt movedand cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldntfor example  that there was once a gallows in his school  
he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom  
the trailer gave away the movies first major plot twist  
if it hadnt  the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldnt know whats wrong with cole  
if youre lucky enough to have not seen the trailer  stop reading this review right now and go see  the sixth sense   
anyway  since the trailer gave it away  i figure its fair game to discuss here  
once malcolm gains coles trust  cole reveals his secret  he sees ghosts everywhere  
dead people wander around not knowing that theyre dead  invisible to everyone except cole  
malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth  
the box office success of  the sixth sense  has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why thats so  
i hate to burst anybodys bubble  but  the sixth sense  isnt really a horror film  
at its core   the sixth sense  is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionallyscarred adult help each other to move past their problems  
some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy  though  
one that really got to me  the ghost of a boy says to cole   ill show you where my dad keeps his gun   when the ghost turns  we see the bullet wound in the back of his head  
osment gives the best performance ive ever seen from a child actor  
its hard enough to find a grownup in hollywood who can give a subtle  realistic portrayal  
although willis gets top billing  cole is really the protagonist of the story  and osment truly brings the complex kid to life  
if only willis work were as impressive  
accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue  willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm  his most challenging role to date  
  this is a bad omen for his next movie   the story of us   which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage   
writerdirector m  night shyamalan has a light  poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite  
hes also a skillful storyteller  as the movies ending demonstrates  
only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie  
look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole  
bottom line  osment should get an oscar nomination  and you should go see this movie
