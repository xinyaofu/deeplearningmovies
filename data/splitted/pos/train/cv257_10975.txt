thats the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into  the wedding singer   the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus  
does he draw laughs from his sad  puppy dog expression and donthatemeforbeingasimpleton observations  
or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people  
or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over  
well  theres a little bit of all of that in  the wedding singer  and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr  sandlers thing  i did have a surprisingly good time  
thats because  in a nutshell   the wedding singer  is one of the sweetest movies youre ever likely to come across  
thats right  
sweet  
the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laughoutloud hysterical but the tone  
well  its just lovely  
i have to admit i was halfexpecting farting armpit humor  gratuitous nudity  superfluous  cloying subplots  and some nasty  unnecessary violence  
instead  
well  ive said it before  
sweet  
the year is  and sandler plays robbie hart  the eponymous wedding singer  a job aspiring rock stars often settle for  
when robbies fianc  e dumps him at his own altar  robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia  drew barrymore  who has some problems of her own  shes marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who  unbeknownst to her  isnt that big on monogamy   
it isnt giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love  
aww    
sandler and barrymore are a good match and theyre assisted by some terrific cameo appearances  including steve buscemi and jon lovitz  whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film  
writer tim herlihy  with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher  keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion  
it doesnt all work but its handled with such lightheartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans  
herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights  sounds  and affectations of the s  
the soundtrackan everpresent force in the filmis packed with walltowall hits of the period  new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idols  white wedding  to the smiths  how soon is now   
to culture clubs  do you really want to hurt me   
the mix of music and fashion would make  the wedding singer  a great double feature with  boogie nights   
if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs  then  the wedding singer  is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride  
if youre a fan of the lovable  laughable adam sandler  well    
lets just say that  the wedding singer  might well be the only film in recent memory to make  me  want to rent  happy gilmore
