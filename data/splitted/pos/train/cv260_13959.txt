  a breed apart  casts rutger hauer as a crazy  birdloving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner  
a bit hard to swallow  
thats only the first of many improbabilities in this film  
hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe  while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector  
turner is the woman caught between the two men  
  a breed apart  isnt a bad movie  exactly  
indeed  i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters  even though their goals couldnt be more different  
the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies  
for example  early on in the film  hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at  his  birds  
later on  the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people  and hauer kills a few of them  
i have a tough time believing that the police wouldnt get involved at that point  
another problem is the silly lovetriangle that develops  
i didnt care one way or the other who ended up with turner  
i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions  
however  despite this uninteresting subplot  turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes theres more to life than money and birds  
as for hauer  hes an actor ive always admired  
he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters  
and this one is no exception  
hes frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse  wearing pirates clothing  and holstering a crossbow  
despite all his eccentric mannerisms  though  hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through  
for example  theres a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early  
he comes off as crazy loner in that scene  but a few minutes later  he is apologizing to turner  and we believe his intentions  
soon after  we find out hes a vietnam vet  and his actions become fairly clear to us  
  a breed apart  isnt a great movie by any means  but it does contain good performances by all three leads  and its worth seeing for that reason alone
