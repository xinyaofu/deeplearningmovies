titanic is so close to being the perfect movie its upsetting that it isnt  
the film  which cost  million to make and could of put th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it sunk  pun intended  is a labour of love for cameron  who wrote and directed the film  
we all know that big budget dosent mean great film  see waterworld     but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic  
but sadly  titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece  although it is one of camerons best films  
the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic  
they find a safe  and inside a picture of a woman  
the woman in the picture  an old winslet  tells the explorers that the picture is of her  
the explorers invite her over  and she then tells her story of titanic  
in the flashback  dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson  who  after winning a poker game  wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic  leaving liverpool to go to america  
also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater  winslet  who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosent love at all  cal hockley  zane  so her family can remain rich  
she nearly commits suicide on the ship  but jack comes to the rescue  saves rose  they fall in love  and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them  
oh yeah  and the ship sinks  
and that is the main problem with the film  and which stops it from being a work of genius  
the story and script  both by cameron  are both weak  
the story is full of cliched characters   the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry  the poor boy with heart  the stuckup mother  and poor dialogue  the script consists of lots of injokes of how the boat wont sink  and most of the dialogue is pretty basic  its a shame really  as the audience does have to sit through  hours of this film  
without good dialogue  a film could become a very long  very boring film  like camerons own terminator     but  luckily  there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear  
firstly  theres camerons direction  
there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic  and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic  
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end  
there is a lot of mayhem and panic  all done very well by cameron  
its a scary sight  watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below  
thanks to camerons direction  then  the audiences attention is held for the full  hours  minutes  
to support the directing are the excellent cast  working very well with their underwritten characters  
dicaprio is good  although he only looks  years old  
his performance of a over excitiable  yet also well mannered boy is excellent  and he also has some funny lines  
winslet is great also  and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth  
zane is deliciously evil as cal  saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash  
the audience really does come to hate him  
he may be playing the same character he plays in every film hes in  like dead calm    but he does it really  really well  
also worthy of note is kathy bates  edward scissorhands    as a loud mouthed american  
finally  the icing on the great things cake are the special effects  
cameron is a whiz with effects  just watch aliens     terminator  and true lies    and they are used very well throughout  
the sweeps of the ships are awesome  although digital domain  who did the effects  cannot animate human movement too well  
the humans seem to move to smoothly  theres just something odd about them  
you can tell that they have been animated on a computer  
of course  the ship sinking scenes are awesome  with bodies flying all over the place  and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed  
titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film  
titanic  then  is a wonder of directing  acting and cgi  but not writing and story  
again  like most of camerons films  the editing is loose  cameron edits himself   and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts  
titanic  then  although not the godfather of movies it could of been  is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius  
enjoyable  scary  and even sad  titanic is a film cinema was invented for  filling the screen with incredible images  and assaulting the ears with awesome sound  
a superb film  but sadly not perfect  
overall rating
