american pie acknowledges a cold  hard fact that most movies dont  it is very difficult to get laid  
its four virgin heroes are jim  biggs   a chronic masturbator  kev  nicholas   who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend  reid   oz  klein   a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning  and finch  eddie kaye thomas   a germphobe  his crass nickname is hilarious  but i wont spoil it here  who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member  
jim  kev  oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women its no wonder theyre horny all the time  
after a party at their studly friend stiflers  seann william scott  in the films sharpest performance  house leaves them sexually unsatisfied  the quartet make a pact  to  lose it  by graduationspecifically  prom night  which is only a few weeks away  
american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds  
almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin whoopee  
all women are there to be ogled  
  alyson hannigans perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch   
situations abound that defy logic only to arouse andor amuse its core audience  adolescent boys  
  to arouse  nadias  shannon elizabeth  internet stripteasean unexpectedly raucous  and guiltily pleasurable  sequence  
to amuse  jims lusty encounter with a hot apple pie   
what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies  aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids   is a cast thats light years more appealing than that of  say  just one of the guys  
two more standouts  klein and  sctv  s eugene levy  
klein plays a kindhearted athlete for the second time in a row  after alexander paynes underappreciated election  
i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon  
levys is the most crowdpleasing performance  and indeed  its nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow  
american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents would let you watch growing up  
it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes  much like john hughes movies did  and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times  most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds  dont you  forget about me    
the picture ultimately has a healthy  if obligatory  attitude towards safe sexeven at their most libidinous  american pies protagonists first whip out a condom  
the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible  
for its familiarity and for its charming leads  i recommend american pie  but the buzz on this film had me expecting something    fresher  
as far as the new teen cinema goes  its at the top of the heap  
  dont say i didnt warn you about the party scene
