written by john grisham and robert altman  as al hayes  
directed by robert altman 
some time ago  a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel  
the novel was a summer smash  topping bestseller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads  
the only problem  the novel wasnt very good  
it was far more pulp than pulitzer  
but the director realized that  no matter how pedestrian the prose  this book really grabbed people  that the author  while not a great writer  was a fantastic storyteller  
so he took on the project  convinced he could make something happen on screen  
the director  
francis ford coppola  
the book  of course  was mario puzos the godfather  
the rest  as they say in showbiz  was history  
by bringing up the godfather  i dont mean to suggest that robert altmans the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness  
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material  
can you get any more questionable than john grisham  
depends on whom you ask  
but theres no question that grishams work grabs people  
like puzo  grisham is a better storyteller than a writer  unlike fellow hack michael crichton  who is a good idea man but who cant tell a wellconstructed story from a can of spam  
so something in grishams unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman  who at  years old remains one of americas greatest living filmmakers  
the result is a gripping thriller that  while falling short of classic cinema  deserves its place in the altman canon  
from its opening shot to the closing credits  the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread  with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe  
this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch  
witness said opening shot  we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing  undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear  
we roll over the hills into the town of savannah  then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone  
right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises  
pay attention  boys and girls  this shot was not conceived by john grisham  but by altman  
this is what a great director can do for questionable source material  
the sports car belongs to rick magruder  kenneth branagh   the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases  
magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office  
outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses  mallory doss  embeth davidzt   just as she realizes her car has been stolen  
driven by southern chivalry  a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress  magruder offers her a ride home  
there he learns more about mallorys life than he bargained for  
her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon  robert duvall   a ted kyzynskistyle whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter  
magruder  perhaps influenced by mallorys decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him  is sympathetic to her plight  and offers to help her get her father committed  right after he sleeps with her  of course  
this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end  
he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital  and for a moment all appears well  
but then dixons crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup  and suddenly magruder finds himself  mallory and his own children in danger  
the cops wont lift a finger to help a liberal attorney  
his only allies are his faithful assistant lois  daryl hannah  and his bumbling privateeye sidekick clyde  robert downey jr   
if this predicament wasnt bad enough  hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos  
altman may provide the atmosphere  but branaghs performance holds the gingerbread man together  
an accomplished actor when he isnt directing himself in vanity productions  branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives  
is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness  or of egotism  
magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it  and by then its too late  
as the plot unfolds  magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are  
and life is never so bad that it cant get worse  
if youre familiar with altmans work  youll recognize several of his signature techniques  
characters are not introduced in establishing shots  but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent  
crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows  making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action  
dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style  
and of course theres my favorite altman technique  the obligatory nude actress shot  
thanks to altman  here are some of the actresses ive had the pleasure of seeing naked  sally kellerman  julianne moore  madeline stowe  even frances mcdormand  
and now i can add embeth davidtz  who looks quite healthy in the altogether  
the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film  
is it oldschool sexism  or a clever injoke  
you be the judge  
but back to the picture at hand  
in the hands of a mere mortal  the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller  no better or worse than the countless others weve all endured  
in the hands of a master like altman  it becomes an exercise in existential doom  in its own way far more successful than scorseses cape fear remake  which tried for the same result  
what may prevent it from enduring with altmans greatest work is a weak third act  in fact  there really is no third act in grishams story  so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up  
but there are true moments of riveting suspense  and great performances by branagh  davidzt and downey jr  more than enough to see you through  
that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman  and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back  should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are  
they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill  
and that  my friends  should make you very afraid
