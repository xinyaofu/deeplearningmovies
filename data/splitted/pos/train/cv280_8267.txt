this three hour movie opens up with a view of singerguitar playermusiciancomposer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members  
all the rest displays a compilation of footage  mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city  halloween   
other footage shows backstage foolishness  and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford  
the performance of  titties and beer  played in this movie is very entertaining  with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil  
franks guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix ive ever heard  
bruce bickfords outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms  morphings  etc  and actually  it doesnt even look like clay  it looks like meat
