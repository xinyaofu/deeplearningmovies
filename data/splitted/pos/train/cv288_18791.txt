notting hills trailer is awful  a laughless  schmaltzy montage  
the movie was desperately marketed to the antiphantom menace crowd  the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter  
and it apparently worked  
perhaps the presence of julia robertswhose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes mehad a lot to do with notting hills opening weekend success  but the films staying power is based on word of mouth  
allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill  
grant stars as william thacker  a travelbookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill  
into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott  roberts   
a common thief  some spilled orange juice  and some stilted conversation leads to their first  highly impetuous  or is that improbable    kiss  
days later  william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist  and so begins a passionate  albeit surreptitious  affair  
  aside  notting hills portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate   
only annas celebrityor williams lack thereofthreatens to drive a wedge between them  
richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered  and for at least its first halfhour the pictures  beauty and the beast  like scenario is  romantic  escapism of the highest order  
as with groundhog day or pleasantville  while watching the highconcept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines himherself in the lead  its williams ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna  
curtis  who previously penned four weddings and a funeral  is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couples situation is not enough to fuel two hours worth of entertainment  so some of notting hills finest moments revolve around williams eccentric friends and family  
by now  dear reader  youve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans performance as williams imbecilic welsh flatmate  
yes  hes a crowd pleaser  a walking sight gag  but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchairbound  and appropriately named  bella  mckee  the anguished waitress of naked  or max  tom mcinnerny   her lousy chef of a husband  
in the movies best sequence  william  anna  and company sit around bloated from maxs latest concoction and hold a contest  the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life  
the scene ends only as a british writer would end it  
if anything  fantastic bits like these dull the main plots dramatic impact  
roberts and grant  especially  are appealing  but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times  four weddings suffered similar flaws   and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common  theyre lonely  
  worth noting in roberts and grants favour  the ubiquitous  im just a girl  standing across from a boy  asking him to love her  episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips  and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done   
notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable  on the visual side of things  i especially appreciated michells playful changingoftheseasons number  
if only  and this is a surprisinly minor gripe  he had lopped off the egregious epilogue  for a story that thrives on what we bring to it  the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up  leaving our imaginations in the lurch
