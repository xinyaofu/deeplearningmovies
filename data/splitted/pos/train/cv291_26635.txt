reflecting on  bedazzled   a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser  one sinful thought remains in my mind  
if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley  who portrays the fiery demon   then use that pitchfork and point me the way  
with her pouty lips  irresistible british accent  and wild display of haute couture  hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation  
its practically impossible to turn this beelzubabe down  
her next target is elliot  brendan fraser   a tech support geek who is clumsy  awkward  and just too eager to please  
to aptly picture him  you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring  steve the copy guy  who effortlessly irritated his coworkers with his unpolished social skills  
eugene  thus  is loathed and feared by his coworkers  who do their best to stay out of his way  
yet  beyond his annoying mannerisms  hes a lovable oaf  
he wishes that he could get closer to allison  frances oconnor   a coworker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him  
however  the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowballs chance in hell  
  dear god   he prays  
  i would give anything to have that girl in my life   
guess who then shows up  
she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse  
  seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul   
theres even an escape clause  
if elliots wish doesnt go exactly the way he likes  he need only beep her  one guess as to what the threedigit number is  and he gets to start over  
the remainder of the film consists of elliots various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth  power  fame and allisons love  
but when he makes sweeping statements such as  i want to be very  very powerful and very  very rich and married to allison   hell soon learn that the devil is in the details  
for example   and weve seen this several times in the trailers   he is granted his wish  but finds out that hes a columbian drug lord and that allison  while married to him  has her eyes on someone else  
apparently  the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul  
his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that shortcircuits his new life  
soon  elliot wishes that he had never made that deal  
given the mischievous nature of the devil   bedazzled  has many amusing moments  
a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance  
he ably assumes various personas  
his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world  
allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her  
hurley also heightens the humor quotient  especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one  
its clear that shes having a good time with it all  
yet  while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes  they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story  
but that would be playing with fire  
what theyve got works  so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is
