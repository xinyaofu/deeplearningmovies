all great things come to an end  and the dotcom era embodies that perfectly  
beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dotcom darling  the company kozmo  com  
an online convenience store stocked with ice cream  porn videos  and other basic necessities of a urban dweller  all handdelivered by couriers within an hour  
designed in  by two college roommates  joseph parks  a  year old goldman sachs banker  and yong kang  kozmo flamed out in three short years  raising more than  million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon  com  
by december   the company boasted    employees in  cities  its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention  
the company was set for an ipo in may     
until april     the day the stock market took its first big dive  ending the internet era  
by april     kozmo was out of money and ceased operations  
unlike the earlier  similar documentary startup  com  which chronicled the rise and fall of another dotcom  govworks  edreams focuses both on its original founders  especially park  and on the common folks that ran the daytoday operations  
the contrast is amazing  showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing  
the films director  wonsuk chin  too tired to die   expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with onthespot interviews with the bike messengers  general managers  and floor staff that kept kozmo humming  
the films images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise  
the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding  to a degree  the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanictype businesses  
in the films final interviews with park  we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers dont return phone calls  
in the end  the name of the game was profit  and if you couldnt make money  even the dreamers got the axe  
screened at the th annual mill valley film festival
