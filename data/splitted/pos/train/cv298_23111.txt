most sequels dont do what theyre supposed to do like  toy story   does  
far too many of them end up rehashing the original and adding very little  
is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors  
thankfully   toy story   is a wonderful exception  
i cant remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one  
its yet another sign that pixar  the acclaimed animation studio behind  toy story  and  a bugs life   is still at the top of its game  
woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the  hit  toy story   and things have changed a bit since the last one ended  
woody  voiced by tom hanks  is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp  
in his absence  he has assigned buzz lightyear  tim allen   now comfortable in his role as a toy  to take charge  
unfortunately  woodys trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale  and is stolen by an overzealous toy collector  wayne knight   
off to save him are buzz and members of the old  toy gang   including mr  potato head  don rickles   rex the nervous dinosaur  wallace shawn   hamm the piggy bank  john ratzenberger   and slinky dog  jim varney   
while in captivity  woody makes a startling discovery  he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a s childrens show entitled  woodys roundup   
he meets the shows other characters  which include jesse  joan cusack   his cowgirl sidekick  the wise old prospector  kelsey grammer   and bullseye  his trusty horse  
they have all been anxiously awaiting woodys arrival  as once their set is completed  they will be sold to a japanese toy museum  and finally escape storage forever  
this means woody now faces a difficult choice  
with his friends coming to rescue him  does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy  or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever  
as in the original film   toy story   contains firstrate animation  and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there  
reportedly  the film was originally slated for a directtovideo release  but after seeing the improvements that had been made  disney rightly decided to release it into theaters  
the film is well worth seeing on the big screen  
the colors are bright  the textures sharp  and even the human characters look more  human   
the animation is consistently seamless  with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable  
there are so many impressive sequences that id find it impossible to list them here  but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al s toy barn  the store owned by woodys captor  
pixars rendition of the family dog is also nicely done  with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it  
the voice work is also perfectly complementary  and as with the first movie  does much to help further character development  
tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz  making you forget who is doing the voice  
it was woody and buzz up there  not tom and tim  
all the cast members from the original reprise their roles  and each is excellent  
several new voices have been added  with joan cusack  kelsey grammer  and wayne knight doing fine work  
  toy story   is strong in characterization  and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie  
woody faces difficult choices  while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasnt yet realized his status as a toy  forcing him to see what he used to be like  
the new characters are also developed quite well  especially jesse  who narrates a sarah mclachlanaided flashback illustrating how she was loved  then forgotten by her owner  
it may be computeranimated  and it may have sappy music  but its downright touching  
the script  despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers  is endlessly clever and inventive  especially considering that its a sequel  
the reason  toy story   works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the originals success by redoing the same story and using the same characters  
not this one  
we get character change  new characters  and new issues brought up  
  toy story   is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself  
there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here  
the humor is sharp and witty  with something to amuse both kids and adults  
there are funny asides to films such as  star wars  and  jurassic park   among others  new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock em sock em robots  and appearances from other pixar efforts  a bugs life  and the  short  geri s game   
  geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woodys broken arm   
the action is fast and furious  and the chases  in the street  in a toy store  in an elevator  on a baggage carousel  and in an airplane  keep getting bigger and better  
  toy story   never grows stagnant  because there is always something new to hold your interest  
the more you pay attention to it  the more rewarding it is  
its rare to see a film like  toy story   come along  because its the kind of film thats almost impossible to dislike  
its created purely to entertain  and though i enjoy a thoughtprovoking drama as much as the next person  its nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do  send us out with a smile  
its a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing  toy story    its the rare sequel that manages to expand on  and live up to  the original
