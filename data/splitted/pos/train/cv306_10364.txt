in essence  good will hunting is an ordinary story told well  
taken as a whole  theres little thats special about this tale  it follows a traditional narrative path  leaves the audience with a warm  fuzzy feeling  and never really challenges or surprises us  
but its intelligently written  with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant   strongly directed  and nicely acted  
so  while good will hunting is far from a lateyear masterpiece  its a worthwhile sample of entertainment  
like scent of a woman  which was released around this time of the season five years ago  good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a worldweary veteran and a cocky young man  
the formula for the two films is similar  both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it  but the characters are different  
al pacinos slade was a largerthanlife individual  robin williams sean mcguire is much more subtle  
and matt damons will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris odonnells charlie  
will is a troubled individual  
as a child  he was the frequent victim of abuse  
an orphan  he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis  
now  not yet  years old  he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet  
he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box  
but hes a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems  
while working as a janitor at mit  he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math buildings hall blackboards  
then  one evening  his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau  stellan skarsgard  catches him at work  
will flees  but lambeau tracks him down  
unfortunately  by the time the professor finds him  will is in jail for assaulting a police offer  
the judge agrees to release will under two conditions  that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist  
eventually  once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man  sean mcguire  a teacher at bunker hill community college  agrees to take the case  
after a rocky start  the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor  
and  as will advances his selfawareness in sessions with sean  he also learns about friendship from his buddy  chuckie  ben affleck   and love from a harvard coed named skylar  minnie driver   
the script  by costars matt damon and ben affleck  is not a groundbreaking piece of literature  and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation  
the characters are welldeveloped  however  and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles  
at one point  will comments that a session with sean is turning into a  tasters choice moment   
later  will gives a brilliant  breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith  
  note  since smith coexecutive produced good will hunting  its not out of the question that he had some input into this scene   
director gus van sant  drugstore cowboy  to die for  culls genuine emotion from his actors  and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes  
theres an edginess to some of the seanwill therapy sessions  and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver  who became romantically linked while making this film  translates effectively to the movie  the willskylar relationship is electric  
likewise  the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckies friendship  
many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation  even if the overall story is somewhat generic  
matt damon  who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker  is solid  although not spectacular  as will  
minnie driver  last seen in grosse pointe blank  adds another strong performance to a growing resume  and its refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one   
the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams  whose sean is sad and wise  funny and somber  
arguably the best dramatic work in the actors career  alongside what he did in the fisher king   williams portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination  
adequate support is provided by ben affleck  chasing amy  and stellan skarsgard  breaking the waves   
like most of what comes before it  the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable  
but meeting expectations and following a familiar path arent always bad things in a movie  provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail  
good will hunting does both  and  as a result  earns a rating commensurate with the  good  in the title
