i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set  unless im watching a movie  
i dont even have cable  so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching  the xfiles  every sunday night  
its the only show thats worth an hour of my time each week  though  since i dont watch reruns  im glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether   
i am an avid fan of the show  and have been for about three years now  
and i love gillian anderson  
the xfiles is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off  
the film is like a twohour episode  except that there are a lot more special effects  the plot is thicker  and the resolution is more satisfying  
this is a terrific film  both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it  i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment   
i expected to like it more than any episode ive seen  and my expectations were met  
actually  the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices  but  thankfully  the makers managed to do it right  
when the finale ended  the fbi branch known as the xfiles had been destroyed  and our heroes  mulder  david duchovny  and scully  gillian anderson  were left stripped of five years of hard work  
the film picks up soon after  and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building  
but wait  im getting ahead of myself  
the film actually opens in the ice age  about    years prior  during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien  
the aliens blood infects them  fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer   and the story jumps into modern times  during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer  
it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy  and mulder and scully uncover the coverup despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi  
soon  they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens  
as ive written before  its not easy to write plot summaries for films like this  because everything needs to be a surprise  
fans of the show will know what to expect  and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film  
director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen  making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television  
there are some truly suspenseful and wellcreated scenes here  late in the film  when theyre in the alien spacecraft  youll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema   
the special effects are very good  and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic  
what i find interesting is that the xfiles is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story  
our heroes are given subtle introductions  were not expected to know them on the outset   and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isnt required to understand the film  
there are  of course  little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans  but ill keep those as surprises  
it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides  and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly  
the series is strong for a lot of reasons  
its original  though it has many ties to  the twilight zone  and owes some homage to hitchcock   and impressively eerie for a television show  
what really makes the series shine  however  are the actors  
duchovny has so much presence  and is just a fun guy to watch  
he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man  
anderson is equally good  and paralyzingly beautiful  shes also a strong actress  
both performers have acted in little more than their series  however  though i think theyll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon  
i enthusiastically recommend the xfiles  both for fans and nonfans  
 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters  and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry  
its an intelligent film  and takes you places that you might not have been  or  at least  might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar   
the xfiles is impressive in concept  as well  fans of the series are likely to be highly critical  and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move  
its nice to see a risk pay off for a change  
actually  its nice to see a risk at all
