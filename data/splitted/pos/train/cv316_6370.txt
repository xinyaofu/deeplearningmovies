if he doesnt watch out  mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max  
of course there are still a few big guns in this film  but theres some accomplished acting too  
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty antihero skin as his career progresses  here he explores a new genre  the businessman as action hero  
in ron howards latest film  gibson plays tom mullen  a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers  
mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom  but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation  
a veteran of numerous hardnosed business negotiations  the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive  he has to play his hand differently  
the casting is what puts this film over the top  
the trio of gibson  the kidnappers mastermind  gary sinise  and fbi team leader  delroy lindo  play off of each other wonderfully  
sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark  
his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h  g  wells morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of 
society  mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below  feeding off the unsuspecting  
gibsons character is an allamerican hero with a few flaws  
his cowboy 
tactics tend to work  but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with  
in a round about way  if he werent known as a man who i s willing to buy his way out of trouble  his son wouldnt have been kidnapped  
as sinise says  youre a payer  
you did it once and now youre going to do it again   
one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities  
lindo calls home to talk to his kids  obviously shaken at working this case  
even the kidnappers are real people  arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars  
gibsons breakdown on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective  
its one of the best filmed representations of a mans world falling apart that ive seen  
its not all perfect  
the shoot em upending  while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution  
as well crafted as the scene is  weve seen it before  
mullens wife  rene russo  has several good moments  but occasionally just seems to be there  
while adequate  brawley nolte  sean  doesnt provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around  
but youll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one  
forget about the large coke  you wont want to leave for that five minute break an hour later
