one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film  
his american buffalo is a setbound piece that has very little plot  
sometimes he will tell a story that really moves  
heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work  
unlike his the spanish prisoner  there are no lapses in credibility  
heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games  
it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will doublecross whom  and frequently it is mamet doublecrossing the viewer  
watching the films team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either  what the heck are they doing   
or  why didnt anybody think of that before   
appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job  
it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay  now a regular actor in mamet films  
this is a robbery that works like a welloiled machine  
there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore  played by gene hackman  filmed on a security camera  
now joe has to get out of the business  
it was coming time anyway  
joes team including bobby blane  delroy lindo   fran moor  rebecca pidgeon   and pinky pincus  ricky jay  is going to split up and go separate ways  
but crime boss bergman  danny devito  is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery  
and he has to take along a young kid  the short fused jimmy silk  sam rockwell   
immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye  
much of what distinguishes heist is mamets dialog  
remarkably it serves a double purpose  
the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamets special feel for dialog  
hackman has lines like  everybody needs money  
thats why they call it money   
mamets timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production  
the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score  which is  in fact  a very similar story  
both are good films  perhaps for some of the same reasons  
but at least on a high level they are much the same story  
the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them  
i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september     
that made the subject matter just a little too timely  
my understanding is that the release will be delayed  
my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeons acting at times seems very poor  
it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection  as if they are just reading the words for the first time  
it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller  
it is one i rate an  on the  to  scale and a high  on the  to  scale
