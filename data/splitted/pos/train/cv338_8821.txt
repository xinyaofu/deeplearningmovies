leonardo decaprio  whats eating gilbert grape  and claire danes  tvs my so called life  star in director baz luhrmanns modernized version of william shakespeares classic  romeo  juliet  
surrounded by a superb supporting cast  including paul sorvino  goodfellas   brian dennehy  tommy boy   pete poslethwaite  the usual suspects  and john leguizamo  executive decision   decaprio and danes shine throughout the film  
the story starts off at a gas station  where the  montague boys  meet the  capulet boys  and square off with one another  
symbolizing the swords of shakespeares day were their weapons  like the  rapiermm  or the  longsword shotgun   
instead of killing each other right away  they shoot around  just like in sword fights of old  
another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeos best friend  
mercutio  who in shakespeares novel was quite a stud  was portrayed as an africanamerican crossdresser whose violent nature  was a definite plus  
miriam margoyles  a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliets nurse  even though she was never given a name  
she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world  
verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeares version  only slightly changed in luhrmanns  
now known as verona beach  the capulets  led by sorvino  and montagues  led by dennehy  are now rival corporate dynasties  
and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars  
one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue  since it was spoken in old english  
subtitles could have helped in the beginning of the movie  but toward the end  it became easier to understand  
this excellent movie poses another problem  what genre is it  
romeo  juliet contains so much drama  yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories  
with the same awardwinning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction  romeo  juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece
