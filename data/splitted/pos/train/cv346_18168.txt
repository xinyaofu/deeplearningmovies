ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon  the book of the dead  
bruce campbell stars as ash  who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods  and his friends who have become demons  including his own girlfriend   
the results shown on screen are amazing considering the films tiny budget  constant location changes  and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years  
followed by two sequels  evil dead ii    and army of darkness     
the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in its original aspect ratio of       
the disc contains two versions of the films audio  a stereo    track and a newly remastered dolby digital     
included are two separate running commentary tracks  the first features writerdirector sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the films star  bruce campbell  
campbells commentary is informative and extremely witty  as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film  
such informative tidbits include  the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead  and in fact when the film premiered in  that was its title  and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead  everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard  
also  theres a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which theyve found thats explaining about the demonic forces in the woods  
for that scene  it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana  so being the wacky kids that they were at the time  they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene  
almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actors had never smoked before  and as a result they became  confused  and were unable to perform the scene  
i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimirob tapert audio track  
the two people youd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all  
dont get me wrong here  when they do speak its entertaining to hear  but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time  
sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask  have anything to say sam   
to me  thats not a good sign  
also  it seems like sam raimi doesnt remember much about the film and its production    
well  compared to rob and bruce anyway  
also included on the disc is a photo gallery  which includes pictures from the films  gala  premiere  and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film  
this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques  
overall  the evil dead is a good low budget horror film  superior to many films in its genre  
and the collectors edition dvd release is well worth your time if youre either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process  
all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining
