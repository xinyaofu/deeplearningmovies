carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven  robocop  came together to create the  mega hit that is total recall  
the film is a masterpiece of sets  action  and special effects  
action and science fiction just dont get any better than this  
the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid  arnold schwarzenegger  who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori  sharon stone   
quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice  a brain implant  fake memory  of a two week vacation on mars  
while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaids memory has previously been erased  
now the people who did it are after him  
quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead  
the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action  special effects  and twist after mindboggling twist  
it grabs you and never lets go  
this film is a winner from beginning to end  
the plot is superb  combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a riproaring saga  
schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever  and the supporting cast is good too  
the action and stunts are terrific  
the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail  
the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action  
the makeup effects by rob bottin  the howling  the thing  and robocop  are top notch  not to mention extremely outlandish  
the visual effects by dream quest  the abyss  and industrial light and magic  star wars trilogy  jurassic park  and terminator   are phenomenal  
the visuals had such a state of the art  slickness  that they won an oscar  
of course the film isnt always realistic  its more fiction than science  
for example  it is true that a body wont explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do  
who cares  
its a movie  
movies are supposed to entertain  
and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific  it may be impossible to beat
