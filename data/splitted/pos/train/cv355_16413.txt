to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie  mulan is a whole new world  
the mouse factorys latest feature is a treasure  featuring magnificent animation  a strong story and finely drawn characters  
mulan is the story of a fiesty  headstrong young woman who  unlike other disney heroines  isnt seeking her prince charming  
mulans motivations are simple  to save her father  serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say  
the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation  
the emperor has called for a conscription  one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation  
mulans crippled father is called  but mulan sneaks off  steals his armor and takes his place  
mulan is a saga of courage and selfdiscovery  
yet  despite the grim backdrop of war  it is a lively tale of selfreliance and brainoverbrawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy  
the movie utilizes a strong corps of asianamerican talent as the voices for the main characters  including the wonderful mingna wen  the joy luck club  as mulan  b  d  
wong as shang  mulans commanding officer and later love interest  pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soontek oh as mulans proud  but loving father  
also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon  sent by mulans ancestors to watch over and help the young woman  
his fast  wisecracking  hiptalking mushu may seem out of place  but its a crowd pleasing performance  especially for the youngsters  
the movie features only a couple of songs  fewer than most previous disney animated flicks  but mulans are winners  
the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot  
the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus  
mulan is a treat  more powerful than hercules  with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame  
at about  minutes  mulan moves rapidly  and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end  
mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain  
also  it is hoped that the success of mulan  and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle  will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asianamerican themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production  
it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them  
committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
