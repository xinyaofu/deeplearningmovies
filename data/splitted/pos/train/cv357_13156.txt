  if theres a beast in men  it meets its match in women  too   
starring sarah patterson  angela lansbury  tusse silberg  david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter  from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus 
in recent years  there has been a trend in the field of fantasy  writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world  investing it with new life and energy  
in modern times  fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased  they have become trite adventures involving leering witches  friendly dwarves  and cuddly talking animals  
but in their original forms  fairy tales have a dark  wicked edge  
crows tear out the eyes of cinderellas sisters  a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version  
hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven  
writers have become fascinated by the bloodier  morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales  and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots  
before this trend was in vogue  angela carterwhose stories always have a dark  wicked  subversive edgehad been reinventing fairy tales for years  
in the company of wolves  she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood  enlivening it with werewolves  rolls royces  and a visit from satan  
the story is structured as a dream  occurring in the mind of rosaleen  sarah patterson   an adolescent girl about whose real life we learn very little  
within the dream  there are a number of inset stories  most told by dreamrosaleens grandmother  angela lansbury   and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing  suggestive ways  
the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister  contemporary fairy tale  
i say  surprisingly  because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong  
and there are ways in which it does  
the performances are mediocre  except for lansburysshe finds the right note for the prim  applecheeked granny  the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales  
the soundtrack  synthheavy  reminded me of bad s horror movies  as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes  
probably stateoftheart at the time  they are now laughable  
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film  he transcends the poor actingmusiceffects and conveys a sense of the fantastic  of otherness  
one of the problems in adapting fullblown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader  rather than being subjected to the realism of the screen  
part of me would love to see an adaptation of the lord of the rings   but  on the other hand  i know that any filmmakers recreation of ents  hobbits  and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind  
this makes jordans accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me  he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery  
the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of urreality  
the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant  
the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly  
the peasant village is rustic and cozy  the woods old and hoary  
this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart  subtle  literate script  a script which is as good as youd expect from jordan  himself an accomplished fiction writer  and carter  
for carter  the cauldron of story is a witches brew  bubbling over with primal ingredients  mistshrouded forests  ancient graveyards  virginal girls and wise women  wolves with glowing eyes  
she adeptly blends them all together  
there is a symbolic richness to the film  everything is permeated with a sense of significance  
the point of it all  i think  is to represent a girls ritesofpassage on an unconscious  primordial level  
a nightjourney through the forest  from the village to the grandmothers home  is the crux of the company of wolves  
  dont stray from the path   rosaleen is told  again and again  and the path is both literal and figurative  the path through the forest and the path of life  
staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleens elders  
carter and jordan  never conventional  explore what goes on when you leave the path  
those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate  
this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves  but the werewolves connote many things  death  sex  knowledge  
if straying from the path leads to death  then its not a good ideabut if thats what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge  and therefore power   then maybe its worth the risk  
when you leave the path  the world becomes a dangerous  ambiguous place  but its full of potential  
and its certainly more interesting than the disney version
