you dont want to be like mike  
mike has been doing badly  
embarrassingly bad  
he broke up a sixyear relationship six months ago to move from n  y  to l  a  and hes still not over her  
as a result  his jokes fall flat when he tries to impress  and hes a comedian  
well  an unemployed comedian  one of hollywoods little fish  and it has gotten so bad hes asked for an application at starbucks  
actually  the starbucks thing gets even worse  
and worse  
you wont fail to like mike  however  played endearingly by jon favreau  
swingers revolves around mikes halfhearted and awkward efforts to get back in the social swing of things  
to this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething actor friends  such as trent  vince vaughn with the films most animated performance   who has the gift of gab bordering on the disturbing side of motivational speaking  guntoting sue  patrick van horn   and rob  ron livingston   who once played hamlet but now longs to work as goofy in disneyland  but doesnt succeed because of his lack of  theme park experience   
together they talk about women  how to make eye contact  which involves avoiding it  and when to call so as never to appear desperate  two days being  industry standard   
after talking the talk  they walk the walk  strutting like the cool swingers they aspire to be  always to laughable effect  
to get mike out of his funk  his friends persistently convince him to get outside  whether it be to a quickie night trip to a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a s swing lounge  
everywhere they encourage mike to look for a replacement  honey  and then keep vigil over his progress  or lack of it  
like dotty doting parents  mike never leaves their company without being the recipient of their confidence cheerleading   youre money  mike  and the honeys know it    or equipped with their eccentric dating philosophies  such as an analogy of flirting with the bear and the bunny  
with the unwavering support of friends like these  maybe mikes not doing too badly after all  
favreau also doubled as the films screenwriter  and he proves he has the gift for creating engaging characters and witty banter that goes beyond todays bon mot  
there is a reassuring honesty to the friendships  even when it hits its low points and the friends commiserate  
when mike gets the gumption to look for love  you will join his cheerleading section as well  
swingers is light  unassuming fare  sweet candy you will want to bust your gut with  laughing  again and again
