  the end of the affair  is a dark and moody romantic period piece  that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs  
although its slow and sometimes confusing to follow  it still manages to give audiences a moving experience  
based on graham greenes novel of the same name  the film mainly follows  characters  
theres maurice bendrix  ralph fiennes  who has an affair with henry miles  stephen rea  wife sarah  julianne moore   
sarah finds henry to be a bore  because well  hes just a normal guy  
its all work and no play with him  
while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah  and would do anything for her  
unfortunately the two break up  
this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks  so that leads us to the present  
its a few years later  and they both still think of each other  so maurice hires a private detective  ian hart  to see what sarah is up too  
while this may sound straight forward its not  
its a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men  unhappiness  and the ever lasting love  
all this may sound like a drag  but it really captures your interest  
with great performances by ralph fiennes  doing another english patient type of film  only this movie is better  and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all  films she did in   i believe this was the role  she had the most passion for  and you can see why  
the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan  
even though i didnt read the book  theres no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive  
whats so moving about it you ask  
the tragedy of it all  
its not the typical romance  in which a guy finds a girl  they fall in love and all is well  this is more complicated and depressing  
it really shows the complexity of a relationship  because nothing is ever perfect  
everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces  
back to neil jordans script  it wasnt only red roses  
there were times when i felt it too be a little slow  but most romances are  
it also tended to be a bit confusing  especially at the start  
it keep jumping around from past to present  so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things  
also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan  
id have to say this is his finest achievement to date  because quite frankly ive never really found his work to be up to par  
it just never did anything for me  until now  
when it ends  it leaves viewers a little saddened  but provoked nonetheless  
this is definitely one of the best films of   and had some of the best acting  most notably by moore  
not for all movie goers  but for those who are film buffs and want something of value
