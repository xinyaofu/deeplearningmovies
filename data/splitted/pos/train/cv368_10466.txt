titanic is  without a doubt  the best movie ive seen all year  
and believe me  im not an easy critic to impress  the english patient was too long  men in black was overhyped  and several of the  big summer releases  were dead in the water  
thank god this film got delayed until december  
its my christmas present  
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of yearsgoneby  and it is truly a stunning film  
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized  never taking your eyes off the screen  nor checking your watch to see how much longer its gonna last  despite its  hour plus running time  
as a friend of mine  whos a true titanicbuff  said  if someone doesnt like this film  its because they didnt want to   
truer words are hard to come by  
of course  it doesnt hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors  james cameron  who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time  
if you wish to argue that point with me  look at his list of credits  the terminator  aliens  the abyss  terminator   true lies  etc  still care to disagree  
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film  he also wrote  produced  and edited it  
and to show his true faith for the project  he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs  
its obvious he truly loves titanic  
the film opens with footage  both real and fake  of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic  where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the  heart of the ocean   which  according to bill paxtons character  would be worth more than the hope diamond today  
their search turns up  dissapointly  no diamond  but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond  
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a  year old woman named rose  who claims to be the girl in the picture  
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond  
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past  
roses narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl  engaged to a rich man named cal hockley  billy zane  that she didnt want to marry  
her mother is pushy and obnoxious  and cal hockley is arrogant  
they are boarding the titanic  which is sailing to america  and this is where she is to marry cal  
meanwhile  a young man named jack dawson  leonardo dicaprio  and his italian friend  danny nucci  win two rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game  
they are overjoyed  and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving  
for them  this is their ticket to america  to a better life  
for rose  she is sailing to her doom  
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt  kate winslet  and jack dawson fall in love  
its the classic wrongsideofthetracks story  and does sometimes resort to a few cliches  
but as i said above  the love portion isnt sappy and doesnt  weigh the film down   as some critics have said  
its sweet  and it didnt make me restless at all  despite the fact that i usually hate love stories  
of course  it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen  
most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in   including the enigmatic molly brown  played by the talented kathy bates   the captain of titanic  bernard hill   and so on  
all of these characters add an extra depth to the film  and make it that easier to watch  
of course  things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark  where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom  
the sinking is depicted realisticly  and the effects are truly amazing  
it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either  as people are portrayed as panicking  pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats  and drowning and dying horrible deaths  
the best part of the movie  in my opinion  comes at the very end  when we flash back to the future  
the crew  who at first had been skeptical of roses story  now are totally aborbed by her  
rose goes out onto the ships ledge  and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard  
we then see a dream of roses  in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson  
most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream  
however  i think it symbolized more  i think it meant that rose had died  and is going to a sort of heaven  which would be the happiest part of her life  her and her one true love  jack  
if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this  email me at venomhotmail  com
