oliver stones latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents  
its a threehour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the th century  
stone doesnt hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house  
the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done  
at the same time he creates a very human character  a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics  which is here pictured as a wild animal  
he is simply trying to tame it  
but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the presidents ability to control them  
stone doesnt in any way apologize for nixon  
he blames not only nixons own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself  the system that  once set in motion  behaves with a mindlessness of its own  
  nixon  is a modern shakespeare story  a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws  
theres something almost majestic about the process  as nixon goes down in this film  there is no gloating  but a watery sigh  as of a great ship sinking  
sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding  creating a very emotional picture of the th american president  
joan allens magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette  
she is strong and loyal as mrs  nixon  
the rest of the cast is equally magnificent  including  james woods  j  t  walsh  paul sorvino  ed harris and bob hoskins  
everyone does a serious and demanding job  no one are disappointing  
stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy  honest and determined  
he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element  
at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixons youth and childhood  
the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin  robert richardsons rich cinematography and john williams musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere  
the films only fault is that its a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers  
still its an honest and captivating  a solid piece of movie making
