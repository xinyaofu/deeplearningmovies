in tim burtons sleepy hollow  there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name  
he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe  
burtons update on washington irvings classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman  when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror  
writer andrew kevin walker  seven  throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes  but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing  as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine  
as sleepy hollow opens  were greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau  who won an oscar in burtons ed wood  
landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow  who  on a fateful carriage ride through the forest  is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider  
after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town  constable ichabod crane  johnny depp  is sent in to investigate  
landlord baltus von tassel  michael gambon  explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case  and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper  played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken  who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods  
crane is not a man of great superstition  and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets  things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie   
first and foremost  sleepy hollow is a fun horror film  
as with virtually all burton movies  we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman  who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly  
the horseman fx are stylish and impressive  particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors  
but why did i enjoy sleepy hollow as much as i did  
although enjoyable  it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right   
it was the light comic touch that burton applied  
the film has the sweetness of a candy apple  usually channeled through depps wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane  who is no longer a mildmannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities  
this is certainly not the only alteration thats been made  
as the film progresses  it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves  
the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together  because for the audience  its not an issue we particularly wish to be solved  
its more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive  
still  we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burtons keen eye to capture our attention  
the costuming is exceptional  and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout  its recognizable that the script was refined by awardwinning playwright tom stoppard   
the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many  
a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassels daughter katrina  and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent  
walken  michael gough  who appeared in burtons batman films  and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles  
i suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow lie within the central trio  director burton  constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy  
all of this is not to be taken seriously  of course  
sleepy hollow is a lavish  frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children  
if youve got a decent head on your shoulders  youll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time
