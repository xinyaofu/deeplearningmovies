i know it already opened in december  but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend  and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price  
as the final scene closed out in happy slowmo fashion  i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking  
jason schwartzman  his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses  steals the show as max fischer  the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades  but compensates for it by organizing most of the schools clubs and organizations  i  e  
the fencing team and writing and producing school plays  and often pulling outrageous stunts  one that eventually earns him an expulsion  
this stunt  building an aquarium on the schools baseball diamond  is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross  olivia williams   
he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume  a very oscarworthy bill murray   who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross  
rosemary and herman begin datingand the fun begins  herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross  
herman manages to destroy maxs bike  while max cuts hermans brakes  and it goes on like this  
but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross  and he cant stand in the way of two people in love  
the academy of arts  sciences really messed up this year  they completely overlooked rushmore  and  if you ask me  it wasnt an accident   
it maybe wasnt best picture material  but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod  instead of elizabeth   and bill murrays absense from the ballot is a complete snub  
the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good  at one point its fun  and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic  
the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling  as well  
i hope rushmore can overcome its oscar snubs  and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers
