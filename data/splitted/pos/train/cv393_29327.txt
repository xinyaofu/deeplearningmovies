plot  odin is a great high school basketball player  
hes dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass  
in fact  the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him  
unfortunately  the coachs real son  hugo  isnt too pleased to hear that  
in fact  he doesnt like hearing about any of odins triumphs  as they generally supersede his own  
so what does he set out to do  
well  lets just say that he starts to mess with peoples heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to    well  
youll see  
critique  a very powerful  thoroughly depressing  wellacted  nonteen  movie starring a bunch of teens  
credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic  set in a realistic high school environment  with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core  
you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film  who turn over some very convincing performances  taking you through all of their characters ups and downs  
hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character  a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of  sign of a good actor  if you ask me   
phifer also comes to play in this movie  with a nice blend of charisma  fear  love and anger spread over his character  
i was always on this guys side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along  
julia stiles was also good  but her character wasnt much different from others that shes played recently  
i was however very surprised with martin sheens showing  since i hadnt taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years  
his character is definitely overthetop in this film  but i appreciated his fervor  his rage  his ultimate and blind desire to win above all  
a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest  
i did have a few reservations about the movie though  
first of all  what was with all of the gangsta hiphop music used in pretty much every other scene transition  
it was cute at first  but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times  
the film was also edited pretty choppily    like 
some scenes were cut out and no one  cleaned it up  afterwards  
i also didnt like the fact that hartnetts character  the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film  was infallible  
in other words  pretty much everything he says or asks of someone  happens automatically and without any goofups  
i mean  i know the guy is smart and all  but i would have appreciated a little more  realism  under some of the circumstances  
but overall  the movie will devastate you  
its not a  fun date movie   
its not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks  
its about jealousy  love  envy  fury  passion  revenge and pretty much any other negative thought thats ever passed through your head  
is it worth seeing  
oh  most definitely  
  pun intended  its a moving picture with great performances  no shakespearian speak  thank you  god   and an outstanding directorial job by nelson  
the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine  and i was especially impressed with the directors choice of music near the end  
in fact  the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver  and i guess thats saying something right there  
wheres joblo coming from  
 things i hate about you     election     hamlet     loves labors lost     natural born killers     save the last dance     shakespeare in love
