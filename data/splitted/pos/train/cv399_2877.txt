marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly  lange  who is topless on the bases beach in full view of the entire personnel  
hanks reaction is one of amusement  
hes been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how  
the problem is carly is a manicdepressive and when she isnt flirting with any man who happens to be near her  shes fantasizing about a fictious world where shed rather be  
typical of the mental illness  she also is promiscuous and foultempered  
the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable  
from hanks reports which state his opposition to the armys methods of testing  he is transferred from hawaii to alabama  
carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe  bleachblond and all  
the new home in alabama is pretty rundown and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum  
after meeting his new commanding officer  booth   hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat  
carly openly flirts with the co  hank tries to deal with the situation  but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool  
arguments ensue  
the family becomes even more alienated  
the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers  much to the vocal objections of hank  who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb  
back at home  the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father cant deal with their mothers problems  
one daughter says   hes blind and shes crazy   
the other answers   theyre perfect for each other   
it reaches the breaking point when the older girl  locane  and a boy  the cos son  odonnell  see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed  
she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open  
hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives  including the cos wife  snodgress

but not about carly  
he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing  
a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife  
hank is arrested  
what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co  he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation  
instead  they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope  
he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters  
carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time  
the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems  
the performances are solid throughout  
jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wifes rage  
he comforts her and offers protection  
lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family  
amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should  
blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family  
the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner  with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling   
the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in   
he had made such classics as look back in anger    and tom jones     
orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years  
the film joins an alread promising fall lineup of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone
