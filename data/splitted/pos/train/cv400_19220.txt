the happy bastards second review  
american pie 
the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest  filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty  
if you go expecting dawsons creek  youre in for a problem  
if your expectations are lower  and better  i might add   you will enjoy the hell out of american pie  
the movie casts several unknowns  with the only real recognizable one being sctvs own eugene levy as a happygolucky dad  
the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out get laid  
thats pretty much it  
throughout the movie  little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout  including a memorable scene involving an apple pie  i wont give it away  but you probably know what it is  and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry  
of course  the movie has some slightly sentimental bits  but they dont drag the movies humor content down that bad  
most of the actors get their job done  but its levy whos a hoot  a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious  visual aids   
i couldnt stop laughing during this movie  and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references  then american pie is for you  
if youre one of those  conservative  types  well  ill bet youre having fun at home while this  south park  and austin powers ii plays in theatres  now arent you
