in brief   this film needs no introduction  
if you havent heard of it  then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical  and if you havent seen it  well  i suspect youre in a small minority  
first things first  is it all its hyped up to be  
well  yes  and no  
its a good film  and theres a lot to like about it  but its not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for  titanic   it was when i went to see  bean  last summer  i think  my intial reaction was  aint that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful  reallife tragedy   
i mean  whats happened to hollywoods scriptwriters  have they run entirely out of new ideas  
gads  whatever next  i asked myself  how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme  
i was not entirely filled with anticipation  but then i wasnt alone in that respect  
its when it came out in the cinema  to rave reviews  well  mostly  and anyone whod been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice  
i didnt see the film until several months after its release  by which time my sister had seen it about four times    
so i went with a slightly more open mind  but i still didnt think id enjoy it much  
did i  yes and no  
mainly yes  im happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done  not so much because of the scripting  ill talk about that later   but because the recreated ship and sets were stunning to look at  as was camerons directing  and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the  human  aspect of the story  the romance between rose  kate winslet  and jack  leonardo dicaprio   was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback  with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day  you knew that  a course  
      
well  its an often effective device to use in storytelling  though sometimes it can fall flat  
does it work here  
in script form it doesnt add all that much to the story  
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart  whose stunning performance is the strongest  most moving of the film  
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion  and depth to the story  and though her appearances are relatively brief  the film would have suffered without her  
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet  who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue  and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving  
its an old story  you know  forbidden love ala romeo and juliet  but it works  and jacks  rescuing  rose  in both literal and figurative senses  and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching  
in fact  i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot  largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm  energy to the romance  
its engaging  touching and very enjoyable  
theres more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well  simply because you know its not going to be a happy ending  
which leads us to the second half of the film  
we all knew it was coming  
im sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it  because as hes stated in interviews  the real thrust of the story  for him  was the sinking  and the jackrose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film  
i think that understates the importance of the romance  as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die  
the iceberg arrives  and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour  
and it is an hour  
my goodness  we dont miss a second of that hour  
gratuitous  well  perhaps not by todays standards  im sure theres been far worse produced under the banner of  entertainment  in other films  
but i certainly wasnt prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be  
not that id expect the word  understatement  to be part of camerons vocabulary  he who brought us such  umm  vivid films as  terminator   and  aliens    
is it overdone  
i thought so  
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy  
no  no one expected a happy ending  but i didnt quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the films second half  
still  whether it was overdone and heavyhanded or not  if it was the shockfactor cameron was after it worked  because i was shocked and moved  in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears  
you really couldnt help but get emotionally involved  whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of roses overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack  or that jack would rescue rose  or that they would both survive  
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk  and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface  
the bit where rose lets go of jacks hand  while promising shell never let go in her heart was particularly heartwrenching  and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image  to put no fine a point on it  
i loved the ending  however  which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half  
so  weve established that the film is powerful and moving  if the last hour was rather excessive  
havent mentioned the script  
plotwise its ok  though the jackrose relationship was beautifully developed  but ive a feeling thats to the actors credit if anything  
as for the dialogue  well  titanic is set in   
its a period drama  
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned  
did they really use phrases like  goddamn it   
back in the turn of the century  
i doubt it  
would someone talk like this   do ya love the guy or what    
i doubt it  
is such dialogue as  i saw the iceberg  and i see it in your eyes now  not just a bit  clumsy  
yes it is  
a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray  and cameron himself is to blame  he wrote the script   
stick with directing  dude  
but its more than redeemed by the acting  with dicaprio and winslet on fine form  ably supported by a strong cast  
star of the show was gloria stuart  though  why didnt she win that oscar   
after all  they were throwing oscars at  titanic  left  right and centre  but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee  
directingwise cameron does a spectacular job  
like i said  his vision was a bit excessive  but at least he directed it well  
i havent even mentioned james horners beautiful score  
utterly heavenly  though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it  
    
ive finished my rant  which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would  
just leaves a couple of questions  was it worth all those oscars  
hell  dont talk to me about oscars  
bloomin farce  
it was deserving in a number of departments  though  
last question  is it  as some suggest  one of the best films of alltime  
nope  i dont think so  
its certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films ive ever seen  but i dont think it quite ranks as one of my alltime favourites  
and as for the fact theyre reportedly making a  titanic    well i guess thats typical hollywood for you
