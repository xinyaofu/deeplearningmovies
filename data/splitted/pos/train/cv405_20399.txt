plot  good ol texan kid suddenly gets to play firststring quarterback on his high school teams football team  in a town where football is considered religion  
the coach is just about the biggest ahole youd ever want to meet  who will do practically anything to win  
the good ol texan boy does not approve of said mans methods  
critique  a fun football movie  
this film was obviously geared towards the teen market  with mtv behind its production  a big tv star actor in the lead role  rockin hip music galore  and plenty of ta  
having said that  i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie  thought james van der beek gave a solid performance  loved the slick sounds  and yup  loved that ta  
i actually thought this was a comedy going in  but overall  it plays more towards the dramatic  than a comedy  
i also enjoyed jon voights performance as the stubborn dick coach  as well as many of the other character players on the team  
this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination  but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the  fun  game of football  or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and fortyfive minutes in the movie theatre  or in the comfort of their own home  depending on where you watch this stuff   
all in all  i would definitely watch this movie if you like football  play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football  
you could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys and girls running around doing their stuff  
and did i mention the ta
