the rich mans wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double  where the story and characters are so onedimensional and contrived that you know you shouldnt be enjoying yourself  
but somehow  the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things  
not that its bad  its just that its been done before  and better  in my opinion  
i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre  but its probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now  you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet  striving helplessly to get out  and instead of just flushing him  you end up kind of rooting for the little guy  
thats basically how i felt about this movie  
i mean  its not very good  but its not completely bad either  
the wife of the title is josie potenza  played nicely by halle berry   
she is married to tony  christopher mcdonald    you 
know  the guy who looks like joe piscapo   a really stressedout businessman who drinks way to much and doesnt give josie the attention she deserves   cough  cough    
thus  she is driven into the arms of another man  jake golden  clive owen   
near the beginning of the film  josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods  
once there  however  tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details  im still not quite sure what line of work hes in   
making the best of her situation  josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars  
one night  she meets a stranger named cole  peter greene  finally getting a meaty role   
they have dinner together  and eventually  both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal  
after learning that she is not happily married  cole offers to  take care  of the problem  
managing to escape from the psychotic maniac  josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband  
but then one night  cole shows up    
and here is where the fun begins  
from this point on  its going to be a noholds barred clichefest  ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects  
this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out  
and for the most part  theyre right  the rich mans wife has nary one original bone in its body  
but who cares  
if youre looking for good ol dumb suspense movie  you cant do much better than this  
and if you suspense buffs arent already sold  it has a killer of an ending too
