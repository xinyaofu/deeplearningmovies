lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie  ok so maybe it is  but this one is enjoyable  and clever  
actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film  
well the ending is kinda scary  but in most horrorcomedies they are  
i will admit that lake placid isnt an oscar worthy film  but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny  
bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating  is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth  after a man is bit in half  
she gets there but really doesnt understand why she is there  
bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened  along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man  they go out and find what is going on  
what they find though isnt great  
a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid  over  years old  he has migrated here for who knows why  
they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from  
betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid  and well youll have to see the movie to find out  
her character is very funny and foulmouthed  which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad  but funny  
to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws  
with the opening sequence  and some others  it is not original and is  
when you watch this movie  you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it  
david e  kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal  writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job  
the characters have smartmouths  two foul  and some great oneliners  
but believe me  dont take lake placid too seriously or you wont like it  
but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun popcorn type movie  
but i guess it rates above the popcorn rating  
sit back  watch the movie  laugh  scream  and whatever you want  
even though the movie is r  and i put violence and gore  
theres really not that much gore  but what there is might seem kinda gross to some  
lake placid is a smart  clever  funny  and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too
