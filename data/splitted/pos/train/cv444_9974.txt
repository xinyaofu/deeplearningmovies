a lot of times a threestar film will be my favorite  
theyre usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too  
theyre usually not too deep  allowing for semibrainless relaxation  and at the same time  not too dumb  
men in black is a fourstar threestar film  
  hope you could follow that one  
men in black doesnt wait to get to the fun  
just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay  tommy lee jones   introduced to an alien  and introduced to the the awesome memorydiminishing tool that all mib agents use  
after all  you cant have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you  
men in black is  of course  the organization which  moniters all extraterrestrial activity on earth   
nypd officer james edwards  will smith   is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the nogood punk hes chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes  
the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end  and with that  dives off of a roof  
naturally nobody believes his story  
  
  
nobody that is  except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of  
edwards then meets agent kay  the man who never seems to crack a smile  and is introduced to the mib  
edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him  birth certificate  drivers license  and even the literal removal of his fingerprints   
james edwards no longer exists  
meet agent jay  
agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about  regular  duties  
eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play  
a  bug  has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two dont  or cant  stop it  
the plot isnt exactly clear  but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth  and that is crucial that the mib find it before the  bug  does  
barry sonnenfeld  who also did the addams family films  directs this nicely  
its fun  its funny  its actionpacked  
a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be  
this is one of those movies that is just  fun  and cant really be summed up any nicer or clearer  
will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch  
definitely one of the best films of the the summer of   men in black comes highly recommeded from me
