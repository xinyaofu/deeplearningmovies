  how do you know when youre finished making love   
jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when youve completed a painting 
jackson pollocks  making love  quote is famous  but in practically the same breath  he said a more constructive thing   its like looking at a bed of flowerstear your hair out over what it means   
it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed  equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept  
the biopic pollock  actor ed harris directorial debut  reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollocks creations as part of the order of things  and should similarly disarm haters of fine art  
arguably more than any other living actor  harris  who also plays pollock  embodies the archetypal working stiff  and his bluecollar demystification of pollocks labourintensive art  both as performer and director  makes for unpretentious cinema  
  from what i know of harris  he  like pollock  was not born gifted or lucky  instead  a strong work ethic is the seed of his success   
granted  its possible that pollock will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable  purpose  of pollocks splatter series  the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing  
the movie pollock is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums  but the motivations are left to our own perceptions  
and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film  as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion  
pollock encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons  alcoholism  depression  and the general attendant miseries of an artist  while finding a place of subconscious expression  
a brief introduction to pollocks raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist  lee krasner  marcia gay harden  awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal   who works from the outsidein  preintellectualizing every stroke of her brush  
in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios  she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas  grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says   you paint the fucking thing   and leaves in a huff  
by the time they wed  she has become his de facto manager  it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline  a most harmonious collision  
  krasner denies him a baby  indicating that it would upset the balance   
such a union is destined to implode  and i hope im not ruining the pollock experience by saying that it does  
while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to startpollock and wife channel their passions elsewheretheir symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years  and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollocks conniptions too many   you are killing me  
you are killing me  
you are killing me   
  aside  harris own wife  amy madigan  is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim   
pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman  the scorching jennifer connelly   hoping  one supposes  to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth  
i love jackson pollocks stuff and i am enamoured of harris pollock as well  
its scrappy and observant  no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish  such as jeff beals hummable but no less lamentable scorei cant imagine that pollock  or anyone  would paint to this music  which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images  
one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet reenactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton  long island  the mounting tension is almost comic  as namuth keeps interrupting pollocks process to reload his camera or take a dinner break  
a more seasoned director mightve been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal
