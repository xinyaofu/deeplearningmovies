catherine deane  jennifer lopez  is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up  
she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma  but the boys parents arent happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life  
as if trying to assure the boys parents wasnt hard enough on her  a new development arises that furthers the strain on deanes mental faculties  
a vicious serial killer named carl stargher  vincent donofrio  has been kidnapping women  locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days  then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into lifesized dolls  
just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell  stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia  
the police  led by fbi agent peter novak  vince vaughn  are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victims body  but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state  
in a last ditch attempt  they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering starghers mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell    
a cell which will completely fill with water in the next  hours  
initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  
while it does share some characteristics with both films  particularly the first forty minutes  which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs   the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  
the buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh  who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  s  losing my religion   wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story  and a good portion of this film supports that theory  
despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments  the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  
all of the sequences where we delve into someones mind are incredibly beautiful  including the dank mind of stargher  whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video   proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  
the first sequence that takes place in starghers mind is by far the best  featuring one of the most ingenious traps ive ever seen in a film  involving a horse  which no one seeing this film will probably forget   a zoolike display of starghers victims which are animated like marionettes  and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room  
if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant  but alas  the sequences only become more silly as they go along  despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film   
the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images  but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance  magnified by ten  thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed   
in my opinion  donofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film  but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful  i  e   
the newton boys  feeling minnesota  the thirteenth floor  and the velocity of gary  that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him  
the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though  and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him  
detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film  as it contains heavy doses of both  
besides the nipple ring removal i mention above  there is also starghers penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs  prior to his catatonia and capture  which will have audiences recoiling  
a sequence where catherine enters starghers mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting  
one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device  
as a narrative film  the cell is sorely lacking  
as a collection of images though  the cell is extremely well done  
although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half  singh has done what he supposedly set out to do  make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together  
unfortunately  a wellwritten script should have been considered too  because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv  provided  of course  that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos
