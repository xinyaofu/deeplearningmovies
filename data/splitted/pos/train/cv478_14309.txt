saving private ryan  dreamworks  running time   hours  minutes  
starring tom hanks  edward burns  tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the greatest war movie ever made   saving private ryan is an harrowing  saddening and riveting movie  
it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion  but its certainly one of the best war movies made  and one of the best of   
tom hanks stars as a captain whos troop has to find private ryan  damon  who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action  
action  drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him  
after the disappointing amistad    spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie  
im not the war movie genre biggest fan  but i found this film to be gripping  and very scary  thanks to the excellent cast  direction and terrifying battle scenes  
tom hanks is superb  straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles  such as in forrest gump     
this time  he plays the role with gritty realism  and is much better for it  
occasionally he overacts the sentimentally  but he generally delivers a fine performance  
edward burns  looking a lot like armageddons ben affleck  also delivers a top notch performance  moving away from his roles in films such as shes the one    tom sizemore makes less of an impact  but is still watchable  and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today  
spielberg directs very well  putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes  
and what battle scenes they are  
theyre truly terrifying  yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen  
the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky handheld camera  and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique  
the gore and violence isnt spared either  which body parts flying  and blood spurting  
this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults  
other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of s film making  
the cinematography is excellent  and the music score by john williams is also superb  
it is never intrusive  and adds to the drama onscreen  
but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan  theres one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film  the writing  
it is unusually flat  with many of the speeches strangely weak  
the film never really makes any profound statements  
this is not a major gripe  as private ryan is a film of action  not words  
still  the script could of been a lot better  
thankfully  the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines  
saving private ryan  in the end  is an excellent film  but not the greatest war movie due to its weak acting  
this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it  as its rewarding and extremely worthwhile  
it really shouldnt be missed  and dreamworks skg has finally found its first hit movie
