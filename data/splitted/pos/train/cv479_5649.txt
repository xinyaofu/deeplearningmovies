s aliens vs  
earth idea revamped  
if you have been following the movie news over the net  you could not have escaped the hype over id  
it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary  
id opened in the us on nd of july  and up till now  only after a week of release  it has nearly touched the us million mark  a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in   
the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple  earth defends itself against the aliens  a typical and highly popular s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era  
the movie opens via star wars  however unoriginal it may be  it worked  
the aliens have sent a large mother ship  supposedly to be  size of the moon  to attack earth by deploying attack ships  miles in radius to all the major cities on earth  
the us president  pullman  does not know of the aliens intention but soon finds out when david  goldblum  a scientist  discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities  
capt  hiller  smith   a hotshot f pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc  
his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders  he crash lands after a spectacular on chase over the grand canyon  one of the many highlights of the movie  
id features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses  
acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle  do we smell a bit of braveheart here     
no prizes for guessing how id ends  its just plain obvious  
id borrows heavily from star wars  return of the jedi  alien and in some parts of the movie  i could even sense a bit of xfiles on screen  
if i were to critically review this movie  id is full of plot holes  corny dialogue  and ridiculously dumb aliens  
however below that waferthin plot and onscreen flaws  id scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion  
an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie  thus maintaining a screenviewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable  no matter how ridiculous  
id was produced under a modest budget of us million  a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich  universal soldier  stargate  and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company  
some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable  especially the epic standoff between  fs and  alien saucers  reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi  
id is a movie for all  
though there are many explosions and implied deaths  there are no gory scenes of human destruction  thus young kids should be able to take it  
sit back and dont be too critical  chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was  
if you are not planning to watch any movies this year  please  at least make time for this one  
this film is best watched on the bigscreen
