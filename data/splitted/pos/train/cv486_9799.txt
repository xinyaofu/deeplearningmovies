every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre  with dramas  it was citizen kane  with arthouse it was pulp fiction  and with comedy it was  well  that jim carrey guy  okay  so hes not a movie  but he did have a huge influence on the genre  
not to mention an expensive one   
sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big  sprawling motion picture event  as did forrest gump four years ago  
with action films  it was aliens  whic was released to much hype seven years after its equallyinnovative parent  alien     
directed and written by james cameron  t  judgement day  the abyss  true lies   the authority on action films  it was a masterful encore to his scifi thriller the terminator     
while the original alien film was a dark  enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew  james cameron took the bigbudget action film with aliens  which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing  although on a muchlarger scale  
and boy  did he take that route  
id say at about  mph or so    
the film opens  years after the original  with lt  ripley  weaver  being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel  
if youll recall  at the end of alien ripley  the only surviving member  cryogenically  hibernated  herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship  
unfortunately  she thought shed only be out for a couple of weeks    
once shes returned to earth  ripley is quickly interrogated by  the company   who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy  
in truth  they believe her  as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an  alien advisor   
it seems that the colony planet was a oncebreeding ground for the nasty aliens  and now all communication with the planet has been lost    
it doesnt exactly take a genius to guess what happens next  ripley agrees  and before you can say  big mistake   she and the half dozen marines  plus the slimy corporate guy  reiser   who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve  are off to the colony  
when they arrive  they find the planet in ruins  
only one survivor is found  a little girl  newt  who confirms that  yes  the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system  
and soon enough  the marines come under attack from the aliens    
what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien scifi movie  the action scenes  
cameron directs them so skillfully  and so suspensefully  that youre literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around  
which features  in my opinion  the best fight scene ever recorded on film  as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death  
many people will tell you that this film  while being a great action film  has no real drama and is all cliches  
well  they would be wrong  my friends  
if this film had no  drama   then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the  academy awards  
thats right  best actress  
you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and fx has got to be good  
in short  aliens combines all the right elements  great action and fx  drama  a good plot  good dialogue  and great villains  into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time  
then again  maybe not  
movies rise and fall from glory and  sad to say  aliens was wrestled from its throne of best action movie by another cameron film  t  judgement day  in   
so who will be the next king  
well  lets wait until december th and see yet another james cameron filmthe highest budgeted film of all timetitanic to make that decision  
i cant wait
