it has happened again  
a movie that is well scripted  well acted  and well directed  
it is involving  suspenseful    
it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus  
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie  
the sixth sense is that movie  
starring bruce willis  armageddon  as a child psychologist and haley joel osment  forrest gump  as a troubled youngster  the sixth sense is more spooky than scary  though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle  
eightyearold cole sear  osment  sees dead people  
not just in dreams  
and not just as lifeless bodies  
he sees them walking around like regular people  
and he sees them all the time  
dr  malcolm crowe  willis  is trying to help him  
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed  resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself  
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole  he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest  
but first he needs to gain coles trust  
the boy is so frightened by what he sees  he has closed himself off emotionally  being unwilling to tell anyone    
not crowe  not even his own mother  toni collette  clockwatchers     
about his  secrets   
crowe begins to spend more and more time with him  even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him  his wife anna  olivia williams  rushmore  becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy  
bruce willis underplays his role  allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development  
crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who wont communicate  to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations  to wondering if perhaps there isnt some truth behind what the boy sees  
mr  willis does a serviceable job  letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona  
elevenyearold haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance  
he demonstrates an amazing amount of selfcomposure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro  
it is fine work for one of such a tender age  
keep your eye on this young man  
the supporting cast is also quite effective  
toni collette  as the confused  frightened  and frustrated mother who cant understand what is happening to her child  olivia williams  as crowes once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband  and donnie wahlberg  ransom  as crowes expatient  now grown  who illustrates his doctors failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable  
twentyeight year old m  night shyamalan  wide awake  directed his own script  maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the films full impact is not reached until its final moments  when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it  
it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr  shyamalan  as the one responsible  is certainly to be commended  
in giving the sixth sense a favorable  three star  review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit  i must also point out that  spiritually speaking  the film is highly misleading  
there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the  living dead   
the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself  
the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve   thou shall not surely die   a direct contradiction of gods admonition  
that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages  
scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ    
an event which has not yet occurred  
therefore  the dead remain in a state of oblivion  having no consciousness  until that longawaited time when the final trump shall sound  
and then  youll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens
