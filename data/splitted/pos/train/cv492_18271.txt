its an interesting premise  
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  
in truth  our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  
what we see  what we do  everything around us is nothing more than a computergenerated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  
our bodies  severely atrophied  are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  
the scifi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  
the matrix isnt it  the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network  a sham world  the ability to plug ones brain into a computer  has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator  dark city  and a few star trek episodes  both classic and next generation   
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thoughtprovoking  
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo  who is plucked out of the artificial world  known as the matrix  by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computergenerated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  
the groups leader  morpheus  laurence fishburne   has chosen neo because he believes neo is  the one  who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence  
from the beginning of the film  we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out  
this  in a lesser movie would be annoying  but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  
what is reality  
what is a sham  
the film turns our very perception of life on its side  
more than once  we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality  or live a life of relative bliss  oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  
as viewers  this is intriguing enough  so imagine what it would be like for neo  
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves  
reeves  whom ive never really cared for as an actor  is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness  and little subtlety  
he was good in speed  for example  but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely  so much of my expectation was happily for naught  
in a couple of places  the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature  and this is a heavy credit to writersdirectors andy and larry wachowski  
i mean  since bill and teds excellent adventure  what movie could you say really  utilized  keanu reeves  
more interesting than reeves is fishburne  whos morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions  and convincingly so  
very surprising for a scifi movie  
fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout  as if he always knows what to expect  
this helps to further the aura of his characters proficiency and extensive knowledge  
hugo weaving as agent smith  one of the artificial intelligences antiintruder programs  is also good playing his deadpan  nononsense  kick ass role  which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time  
unfortunately  when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row  the nature of his characters speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive  
carrieanne moss plays trinity  morpheuss number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo  
although her character is somewhat inconsistent  moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isnt in the picture  
there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects  
many methods of imagery are employed  from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics  
of special note is the use of the  freeze and turn  effect where the entire scene is frozen  turned  then continued from a new angle  
this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semicircle  with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends  
the motion cameras film the action  and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once  
place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second  
pretty slick  
the matrix drips with style  
from the clothing to the music to the action  were watching an exaggerated version of what were used to  
much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film  theres a lot of kung fu  theres a lot of gunplay  
when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon  much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion  
theres also the element of the japanese action cartoon  called anime by aficionados   especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects  
combined  its really like no liveaction film i have ever seen  
the film is not without its faults  
some of the scenes and ideas are  borrowed  a little too liberally from other films  and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing  
some of the lines are also pretty bad  in one instance  a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying  and it wasnt meant to be a joke  
however  these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action scifi film that for once does more than merely entertain
