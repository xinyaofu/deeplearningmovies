one of kyle mclachlans earlier cinematic features  this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator     species    and the more recent  fallen with denzel washington  
plot  a sciencefiction picture set in modern times  this thriller follows the exploits of an  entity  from outer space  who likes to inhabit human bodies  use them up until they are completely worn out  and then switch over to the next available receptacle  
fbi agent  mclachlan  and local top cop  nouri  are charged with the capture of this  thing  before its too late  
critique  this fastpaced  urban equivalent of the thing     checks in on all cylinders for ultraviolence  god knows how many people died in this movie   action and an overall rock n roll attitude  
then again  how can you go wrong with an  alien  that likes the ferraris  guns  heavy metal music and sexy girls   
granted  the plot isnt the most elaborate of tales  alien bad  find alien  kill alien   but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture  
i wouldnt recommend it to those who dont like car chases  murders  and bland acting  but for all the rest of you out there  those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again  sitting back  slamming back some salsad nachos  and relishing in the cheeze some call film    
have a blast   
two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gorefest  
the opening sequence is one of the most rockin scenes to open any action movie  and the subsequent extraterrestrial  transformation  is another eyecatcher  
even the late s special effects were okay  
followed by the hidden ii in   
little known facts  this film was kyle maclachlans first nondavid lynch foray into the world of feature films  
his first two movie appearances were in lynchs wretched dune    and the sensational blue velvet
