i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david leans war picture  
i still think that it doesnt deserve being the number  in the american film institutes list of the  greatest american movies  
and i think that lumets   angry men   wilders  witness for the prosecution  and kubricks  paths of glory  would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in   
but i cant deny the importance of  the bridge on the river kwai   cinematically and in its contents  
the film is set in burma in   
a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai  
but the british commanding officer  colonel nicholson  alec guinness   insists  corresponding to the geneva conventions  that his officers neednt work as simple workmen  
struggling toughly  col  nicholson forces the japanese commandant  col  saito  sessue hayakawa   to give way in this respect  
afterwards col  nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge  
he considers it an opportunity to raise his mens morale  and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese  
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge  among them the american shears  william holden   an escapee from the japanese prison camp  and the british major warden  jack hawkins     
a flaw of the picture is the clich  d characterization of the japanese people  
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british  as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge  
and the film doesnt consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in  paths of glory   
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies  
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col  nicholson and col  saito  
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears  who doubts the military logic  is a somehow unpleasant person in the film  
the audience is supposed to applaud col  nicholsons perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not  
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col  nicholson takes for his men  
  the plot bypasses these risks   
that means  the picture isnt perfect  
but it has a lot of virtues as well  
it shows the  madness  of war and what war can produce in peoples minds  
it shows how col  nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others  like shears  get cynics  
and  the bridge on the river kwai  is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests  
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an antiwar film  despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme   
david leans effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense  especially in the dramatic  though not wholly plausible  showdown  
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col  nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character  
the other actors deliver very good performances as well  
jack hildyards fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful  
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses
