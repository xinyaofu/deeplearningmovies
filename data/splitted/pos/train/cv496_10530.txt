when quentin tarantino made  pulp fiction   he was not only making the greatest film of the s  he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time  
but before you send me hatemail for not giving that title to  citizen kane   hear me out  
much like  citizen kane    pulp fiction  has changed movie making forever  
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact  
  pulp fiction  has actually ushered in a new era of film making  
it has altered the way films will be viewed  
  fiction  has spawned so many imitations  ive lost count  
sure  some have been excellent   bound  and  the usual suspects  spring immediately to mind   but any serious moviegoer recognizes  pulp fiction  as the original neonoir of the s  
in this review  i hope to change all the peoples minds who have criticized it for its excessive profanity and violence  which  by the way  isnt really that graphic   
the most brilliant aspect of tarantinos masterpiece is the screenplay  
it is filled with so much classic dialogue  the  quarter pounder with cheese  speech will go down in history   it should be required reading for any film student  if it isnt already  
the story  told in unorthodox nonlinear format  centers around three main episodes  all of which eventually intertwine  
the first  titled  vincent vega and marcellus wallaces wife   deals with a very loaded john travolta  i forgot to mention the cool heroin shootup sequence  taking mia wallace  a starmaking performance by uma thurman   his bosses wife  out on a date to a cool s restaurant called jack rabbit slims  
they talk for a while  with the occasional  uncomfortable silence    mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror  
after giving marcellus new bride a foot massage  he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse  giving him a  speech impediment   
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic  you never can tell   
i wont reveal the rest of the story  but ill definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night  despite the cool trophy they win  
the second story  the least of the three but still four stars  stars bruce willis  proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the  die hard  flicks  as boxer butch coolidge  
previously in the film  like i said  its told in nonlinear form   he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match  
as it turns out  he not only doesnt take the fall  but he ends up actually killing his opponent  
he takes a cab to his halfwitted girlfriends apartment  and to make a long story short  ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch  sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flashback sequence  
on his way home  he bumps into  literally  marcellus  
the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers  which results in the infamous  gimp  scene  which is very reminicent of the  squeal like a pig   
scene from  deliverance   
the last  and best  in my opinion  of the episodes features john travolta  again  and samuel l  jackson  in the best performance of any supporting actor ever  as two slightly offkilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car  
they seek help with a friend of jacksons  played by the qman himself   desperately in need of a stress ball  
they end up calling a  cleaner  of sorts  played by the god among men harvey keitel  to help them out  
in the end  the story brilliantly loops around itself  actually ending where it began  
if you havent already seen the film  or even if you have  for that matter   i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition  
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen  
earlier today  i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago  
what the panandscan did to this movie is inexcusable  
that version cut out  like  half the movie  
what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing  
for instance  when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end  the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses  
this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place  
just a theory    
one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies  i  e  
  psycho   kiss me deadly    deliverance   etc    
but why shouldnt he  
its not like he outright and blatantly stole  
give the guy a break  
in case you havent already noticed  i believe  pulp fiction  is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time  up there with such greats as  casablanca  and  the godfather    
trust me  you will not see a better film come out of the s  
and besides  its one hell of a ride  
note  if anyone knows how i could get a  bad motherfucker  wallet  please email me  
any help would be greatly appreciated
