this summer  one of the most racially charged novels in john grishams series  a time to kill  was made into a major motion picture  
on january  of this year  director rob reiner basically rereleased the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi  
based on the true story of  civil rights leader medgar evars assassination  ghosts of mississippi revolves around the year legal battle faced by myrlie evars  whoopi goldberg  sister act  and her quest to have her husbands obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith  james woods  casino  jailed  
so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter  alec baldwin  heavens prisoners  to imprison the former kkk member  
ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from africanamerican history  from slaveship miseries to life in the racist south of the s  
but all too soon  the white folks take over  intoning lines like  whats america got to do with anything  
this is mississippi   
as beckwith  james woods  with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man  teeters between portraying evil and its character  
meanwhile  goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldnt let her husbands death rest until she got the conviction  
both deserve serious oscarconsideration  
this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin  
lets face it  trying to match matthew mcconaugheys wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible  
and baldwin is living proof of this  as no emotions could be felt  
it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear  
either poor acting or poor directing  but something definitely went wrong  
another strange mishap was the fact that goldbergs facial features didnt change  as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husbands dead body years earlier  
yet woods was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldbergs father  
at least the makeup was realistic  
with some emotional moments in the poorly written script  ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart  when its predecessor  a time to kill  brought tears to everyones eyes  
dont get me wrong  the movie wasnt all that bad  but if youve seen grishams masterpiece  then dont expect this one to be an excellent film
