losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing  
reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare  
while we all might feel the desire to blow someones head off with a shotgun when they dont seem to grasp our point of view  actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid  
this isnt the case with sam baily  john travoltas slightly askew averagejoe persona in mad city  
  i dont think people listen to guys like me   sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum  
just a few days ago  sam was a guard at this same museum  but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position  sams apprehension resulted in a brash decision  
in an effort to get his exboss  museum director mrs  banks  blythe danner   to  just listen   he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun  taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage  
sams overall concern is valid enough  if he loses his job  his paycheck  his benefits  etc   his wife and two children wont be provided for  
hes not a lunatic or a hottempered madman  hes somewhat like a child  panicky  compulsive  and running on emotion  and his naive intentions arent helped any by the fact that banks wasnt overly compassionate with the let go  
overall  hes just like you and me  except that he has the capacity to view the line wed deem  far enough  as the starting mark of some crazy race  
meanwhile  television reporter max brackett  dustin hoffman  is also on the scene  
covering a  fluff  story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks  max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggestbreaking news story he ever couldve hoped for  
having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting  max is anxious to turn this into his  and only his  story  
max immediately bonds with sam  
max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone  
at first  maxs intentions dont stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor  but as he gets to know sam more personally  he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him  
the media  however  is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill  
the accidental shooting of exco worker cliff  bill nunn   a black security guard  becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sams honest ambitions  
also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts  head of the news department of the station max falls directly under  and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander  who uses his network power to try and outshine max  
alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities  
then there is mia kirshner  who plays the young tv station intern laurie  
she falls under maxs wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting  
kirshners credits are relatively small for now  including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow  
still  kirshners character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kindabitchyinareservedway roles  
i wouldnt mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts  where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen  
while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy  selfrighteous monster has indeed been tackled before  mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability  
hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors  and seeing them together is a real treat  
they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters  and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both  
there is quite a bit of humor in this film  and without it  it couldve fallen into a drab  cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause  
this isnt a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart  but it will lightly touch both  making for a recommendable movie  
if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time  i urge you to check this one out
