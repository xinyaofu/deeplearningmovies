as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it  the more pleased i was when i left  
first  getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz   if you liked scream  youll love wild things   
  campbell gives a stunning performance   
  this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days   
  oh yeah  the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me  
now  onto more serious stuff  and with this film  i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way   
wild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
im not saying that in a bad way  but when you see this film  you may be shocked by what you see  
however  perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the films charming cast and tricky plot  that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon  im bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is  i have already seen it  
and i like it  
wild things is a film noir of the s  filled with s sensibilities  and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people  seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure  its all too good to be true  but aint it fun to watch  
when movies like this come along  sort of a better version of basic instinct  there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who dont want to admit liking what they see  but i tell you  most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school  the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
its almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance  totally based on looks alone   
of course  there are those select few who may look slightly ugly  but compared to the average person  they are gorgeous  
immediately  the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains  right  
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen  it certainly doesnt turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom  with nearly all the main characters present  
theres sam lombardo  matt dillon   a counselor for the students  
hes heading the class discussion  
theres also kelly van ryan  denise richards   a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class  however  are two policemen  ray duquette  kevin bacon  and gloria perez  daphne rubinvega   who want to talk about sex    
  cheers  crimes  boos    
  what is a sex crime   
ray asks  
  not gettin any   
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however  upon hearing this  one student  suzie toller  neve campbell   stands up and leaves the room  commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  
and so  wild things sets into motion  
quickly  kelly begins hitting on sam  but sam doesnt want anything to do with her advances  
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  
surprisingly  thats really all i can tell you about the plot  
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  
and whats more  these plot twists are actually unpredictable  
going along the way of scream  wild things maintains that films surprises  and then adds even more to them  
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  
and even though you think you may get tired of them  the surprises are so genuine that its rather pleasing  
going back over them in my mind  nearly all of them work  though some stretch the boundaries of belief  
thankfully  the convoluted plot doesnt give us much time to think about each one  pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  
as for the critics who complain that the film is trashywell  it is  
this is pretty much just one trashy film  
however  it is the kind of trashy that isnt hard to watch  
its good trash  in a sense  
one  the screenplay knows that its not to be taken seriously  and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  
this varies everywhere from kellys mother  theresa russell   who is more of a caricature of rich people  all the way to an ambulancechasing lawyer  bill murray   who wears a neckbrace to cover an insurance scam he is running  
bill murray also provides the best character in the film  and most of the genuine laughs  
and two  the sex is more than gratuitous  although not unwelcomed  
wild things is supposed to have sex in it  what film with that title wouldnt    and this movie breaks the boundaries  
instead of having heterosexual sex scenes  it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell  dont worry    
its not as graphic as you might think   
the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic  but the surprise shocker is kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene  
its very brief  so if you blink  you may miss  ahem  it  
and  for as long as i can remember  i dont think i have seen an rrated film show an erect one before  its not completely  but judging from the audiences reaction  it was more than they expected too   
also  during one scene late in the film  there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillons characters  but nothing came of it  makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating  or if the actors refused to do it   
what first made me want to see wild things was its cast  
neve campbell  of course  has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released  
here  however  she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead  
the closest role to this was her performance in the craft  though even in that she was a nice girl   
campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent  
you can tell she will be around for a long time  
denise richards will also be around for a long time  although she may be limited to the roles without much range  
here  she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff  yet effective  performance in starship troopers  
hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability  
and then there is daphne rubinvega  a newcomer to the movies  
she gives a very good performance  although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half  
towards the end she does get a bigger part  
on the male side  matt dillon is probably the best  giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist  
kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character  but he makes the most of it  
you must have admiration  though  for what he did on screen  
and judging from many of the womens reactions in the theater to that shot  they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon  yeah  right   
and then there is bill murray  
his performance is the comic relief  and he nearly steals the film  
as a whole  the entire cast works wondrously together  and they seem at home  even when doing the menage a troi  
director john mcnaughton  who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry  portrait of a serial killer  has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works  
his direction is smooth and stylish  
the visuals are striking  filled with rich colors  and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air  
however  he seems more at home when the actors arent talking  
his flyby shots of the swampy areas are brilliant  and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight  
the cinematography is gorgeous in its details  its not often that you see a film like this  and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures  
then  there is the music  
this was probably the most obvious thing to me  as it set the perfect mood for the film  
its hard to describe in words  so just see the film and listen to it  
its wonderfully composed and presented  
and be sure to stick around during the closing credits  
mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use  while most comedies use it for outtakes   
he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events  
some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot  but its an entertaining way to finish the film  
plus  there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun  
wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality  nudity  language and violence  
again  the nudity is rather unnecessary  but lets face itpeople want to see it  
so why not give it to them  
neve campbell  admirably  has a nonudity clause in her contract  and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off  way to go  neve    
the sex scenes are graphic  especially the first one we see  between the mother and one of her deck hands  
one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating  
the language is quite harsh too  ranging from sexual innuendo to your average  everyday profanity  
and i cant stress it enough  dont allow kids under  to see this film  
the target age for the movie is the  range  and thats who should see it  
its definitely not for those under   
did i mention that this film is rated r  however  for those that do get a chance to watch it  you will probably more likely be pleased  and may even take friends to see it the next time
