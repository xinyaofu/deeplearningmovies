there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have  but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason  
  good will hunting  is about one of those people  
the will hunting of the  horrible  title  lets face it  this film would be a bitch to title   played by cowriter matt damon  is a mathematical genius  
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino  
and he works at mit    as the janitor  
one day  the professor of one of the most challenging courses  proffessor lambeau   breaking the waves  s stellan skarsg  rd   puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete  
the next day  its already done on the board  but no one in his class claims to have done it  
so lambeau puts another problem on the board  this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove  
and  duh  its done again  
of course  they catch the guy who did it red handed  will  
before lambeau can find will again  he ran away when he caught him   will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court  and struck a police officer  so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements  a  he work with him on math  and b  he get some therapy  
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another  for a hypnotist  he fakes being under his spell  then launches into an impromptu performance of the s classic   afternoon delight    
finally  lambeaus old college roomate  sean mcguire  robin williams   a psych professor  agrees to treat him  and the two begin a rocky relationship  as sean tries to get will to open up  
turns out will had a rough childhood  being abandoned  and placed in foster homes and what not  
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life  he wants a challenge  
and that is to hang out with his buds  including the other cowriter  ben affleck   and do honorable jobs  like construction  
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky  
should this guy be forced to do something he doesnt want to do  
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film  which is jampacked with greatness  but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should  
im not saying  good will hunting  is a bad film at all  
its a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments  and lots of great things about it  
the acting is amazing  with two oscarnominationworthy performances from damon and williams  who have amazing chemistry together  
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg  rd  great name   ben affleck  and from minnie driver  who plays wills love interest  skylar  
there are tons of individual moments that i adored  
i loved all the comedy in the film  especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks  his various attempts at therapy  and of course  my favorite scene in the entire film  the one where he delivers a long  exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them  
i liked the relationship between some of the people  like will and skylar  will and sean  sean and lambeau  and will and his friends  
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch  
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal  that i felt rightfully uncomfortable  
like the breakup scene between will and skylar  will and seans first meeting  a bar scene between sean and lambeau  and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesnt regret meeting his first wife  who would later suffer a slow  painful death  and leave him lonely and slightly bitter  
however  the main flaw of the film is theres too much of everything  and not enough of it either  
the film tries for deeper relations between the characters  but theyre sometimes either overwritten or underwritten  
take for example the relationship between sean and will  the film gets an interesting fatherson as well as doctorpatient relationship going with out any problems  but when it tries to show them as equals  it falls on its face  
we hear how they went to the same town  and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times  
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do  
also  wills relationship with his best friend  chuckie  affleck   has a nice climax  but not enough rising action  
we see them joking around  but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them  it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one  
their relationship never goes beyond  just best friends   and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more    human  
maybe it was just me  
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau  but that  again  is underwritten  
and  of course  as in most films like this  the girlboy relationship is pretty underwritten  
we never understand what they see in each other  so when skylar confesses that she loves him  it seems more like its there for plot details that anything else  
minnie driver is interesting  though  and breathes life into her character  
the writing is a bit at fault here  but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness  
sure  it feels overstuffed  but its extremely enjoyable  
the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh  and seems extremely human  
i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue  which is amazing  
while this is probably director gus van sants most conservative film  youd hardly know its the same director of  to die for   the only van sant film ive seen  really   its still a pretty remarkable film  albeit a tad overrated  whats this  best picture  deal    
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws  i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone
