i guess its a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour  could not be ruined even by the nauseating  comedy  of chris tucker  
im a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium  and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick  but show off his comic timing as well  
it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title  
the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects  
this time around  the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan  john lone   who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states  im still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that  is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones    
the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns  
of course  its up to hong kong detective lee  chan  and trashtalking lapd detective james carter  tucker  to take the bad guys out and the authorities  to the extent that they even exist  stay out of their way  
rush hour  turns the tables on the first film in that here its carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out  
i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan  
he refuses to shut up  
not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head  but his jokes just arent funny  a pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny  
i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates  but didnt anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was  
if this is all the comedian has to offer then i dont care to see any more of his films  
fortunately  chan makes for a marvelous straight man  and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely  
its not often that one actor can so completely save a movie  but there is no other name for what he does  whenever hes on screen  rush hour  comes to nearly breathtaking  often hilarious  life  
much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a  player   but who cares  
i can think of few high concepts that are funnier  
the movie ends with outtakes that  as usual  show that chan isnt perfect  and that it does  indeed  take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless  
chris tucker botches some lines as well  and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie  
a lot of people have pointed out rush hour  isnt very different from its predecessor in tone or style  
but i liked the original  and i like the sequel  though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it  
director brett ratner  the family man  keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes  i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works   
its not great jackie chan  but its jackie chan  and thats enough  
up next  jay and silent bob strike back
