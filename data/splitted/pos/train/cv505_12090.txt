some critics  including siskel  ebert  are on the record stating that martin scorseses raging bull  the story of boxer jake la motta  is the best film of the s  
since there are still a number of s films that i havent seen  i dont feel qualified to make such a judgment  but ill say this without hesitation  raging bull is a great motion picture  and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january    and december    come close to its level  
biopics often fall into one of two categories  overblown hero worship or a dry  dull textbook account  
its rare that a movie with the moniker  based on the life of   comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  
raging bull is the perfect counterexample  and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta  a middleweight icon from the s and s  and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  
for all  minutes  director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro  in the title role  have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic  sad  and horrifying  
historically  raging bull is said to be mostly accurately  with the lions share of the details culled from la mottas own autobiography  which was cowritten with joseph carter and peter savage   
however  although la motta is credited as the movies  consultant   he was reportedly unhappy with the final result  because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth  insensitive lout  
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base  bestial impulses  paranoia  jealousy  and blind rage  
sex and violence are inextricably linked  
the title is apt  la motta is a raging bull  
in the ring  he is a terror  not just beating his opponents  but destroying them  
outside of it  he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  
the two people who spar with him on lifes canvas are his wife  vicki  cathy moriarty   and his brothermanager  joey  joe pesci   
these are the two who mean the most to jake  and who  as a result of his inability to trust himself or others  he loses  
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity  and  when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him  his lets loose with an explosion of violence  
raging bull opens in  when la motta  an upandcoming fighter  is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  
over the years  he wins several key bouts  including one against his archrival  sugar ray robinson  johnny barnes   but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  
meanwhile  away from the ring  la motta falls in love with year old vicki  who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife  
vicki becomes jakes greatest prize  a wife  in his view  is not a companion  but a possession  and the source of his most extreme pain  
his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him  
hence  he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else  perhaps even his brother  
  this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere   are you f   king my wife      
in the late s  la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight  but with one huge condition  he must take a fall  
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing  
two years later  he wins the championship  only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray  
by the late s and early s  when the film ends  jake has become a pathetic figure  a broke  overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor  has lost his wife and children  and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine  
raging bull is the other side of rocky  
sylvester stallones tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in   
it won the  best picture oscar  and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production  
but  where rocky romanticizes boxing  raging bull takes a cold  unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring  
while scorseses primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man  he never backs away from showing the seedy  ugly underside of a sport where gambling  greed  and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working  
rocky shows boxing at its noblest  raging bull shows it at its most diseased  
theres little i can say here that hasnt already said about de niros performance  
in a career that has included many fine roles  this is his most outstanding  
the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering  
and  although theres a lot of travis bickle  de niros character in taxi driver  in la motta  scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that  if we never fully sympathize with him  at least we understand the forces that drive him  
this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting  
as the younger jake  de niro is trim and fit  
as the fat  older man  de niro gained  pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form  
how many actors would go that far  
the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance  
cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work  although neither won   
their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niros  
pesci  who has basically recreated the same personality in two other scorsese films  goodfellas and casino   presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother  
the misogyny and violence are still there  only better concealed  
but  when joey snaps  as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster  frank vincent   its startling to behold  
moriarty  on the other hand  must play the temptress with virginal qualities  the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake  
later  shes called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear  
scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in blackandwhite  a few  home movie  segments are in color   
the choice is perfect for the movie  giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a blackandwhite approach is almost unheard of  
  one important recent exception  schindlers list  eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did   
in blackandwhite  especially considering scorseses choice of shots and use of slow motion   the violence is stark and disturbing  
theres no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas  
during fight sequences  the director also uses a number of pointofview shots designed to show the world  however briefly  from la mottas perspective  
scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la mottas loss to sugar ray  where he surrendered his middleweight crown  
after that  his career was all downhill  
yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment  stretching more than a decade into la mottas future  
the reason is obvious  scorsese isnt as interested in boxing as he is in the character  
following his retirement  la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever  but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies  
we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self  
who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brandos speech from on the waterfront  
   i coulda been a contenda    
perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the s  
and  if not  its certainly perilously close to the zenith
