nosferatu the vampyre  germany   
a film review by mike watson copyright  mike watson 
this extraordinary retelling of bram stokers  dracula  by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore  
inspired by f  w  murnaus  silent film of the same name  herzogs film is a work of exquisite bleakness  an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards  
the original fulllength english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u  s  distributor anchor bay entertainment  and in gorgeous widescreen prints  
until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video  and only in europe  
both of these rereleases restore the film to its full length  but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue  
apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent  and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed  
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one  
everyone knows the story of dracula  
or do they  
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly wont hurt  
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count  played by klaus kinski  who wants to buy a house in harkers hometown  
upon seeing a photo of harkers wife  the radiant isabelle adjani  he instantly falls in love with her  
locking harker up in his castle  he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him  
upon divining his identity as a vampire  adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises  
that is a story familiar to millions  but herzog has elevated stokers tale into the realm of  and i use this term a tad reluctantly  cinematic art  
nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film  shot through blueish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised  
the films surreal  dreamlike quality is utterly mesmerising  
there is much to enjoy  but ill limit my praise to a few key points  
holding the film together is kinskis remarkable performance as count dracula  
past screen portrayals  including bela lugosis famous turn  have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp  
but kinski    oh boy  this is something far more compelling  
aided by a startling makeup job  he portrays draculas vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease  
this man is dreadfully lonely  
he lives in utter solitude  shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust  
kinskis portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting  
when he dies  you almost feel as if this mans tortured soul has been freed at last  
then theres the unforgettable soundtrack  largely composed by german group popul vuh  
it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that its quite impossible to imagine the film without it  
popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancientsounding kind of spacemusic using piano  chants  and exotic instruments  
when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums  
the one i still listen to the most is  tantric songs   from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken  
its a testament to the musics depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them  
the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies  
this is a timely rerelease by anchor bay  
after francis ford coppolas unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stokers tale in   it is a joy to go back to herzogs film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a centuryold story  
to some aficionados  nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made  
without a doubt  it is an unmistakable classic of the genre  
dont miss it
