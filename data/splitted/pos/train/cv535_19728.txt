its a curious thing  ive found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie  hes much better and so is the movie  
even though  in the sixth sense he is the  name   he doesnt have the pivotal role  
that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear  cute pun  seer  a  year old boy who can see ghosts  
if osment was cute or precious  the director going for the maudlin  this would be nothing more than a movieoftheweek  thankfully  osment is not only better than that  but in some instances  blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance  
we get to see his fears  vulnerabilities  strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies ive seen this year  
the whole cast matches him in quality  with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter  
one thing about this movie  its target  
this isnt a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest  this is more what id call a supernatural drama  more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup  
one caveat  theres a lovely twist in the movie  something like the usual suspects  where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen  
i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto  before any hype or critical reviews were out  so i went in with no biases  
if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it  dont let them  
let the director explain on his own pace and youll enjoy the movie vastly more
