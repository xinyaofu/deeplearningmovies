the heist of a flawless   carat diamond  fixed bare knuckle fights  irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchiess sophomore feature   snatch   
  lock  stock and two smoking barrels  introd helmerscripter ritchie with a hyperkinetic  in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewers attention from beginning to end  
his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive  
with  snatch   the director doesnt remake his first work  but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london  mining a rich collection of characters in the process  
from the very beginning   snatch  tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond  the desire of new york gangster avi  dennis farina   
en route from antwerp  diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers  benicio del toro  stops in london to make a separate deal with avis partner and cousin  doug  the head   mike reid   
frankies addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris  the blade   rade sherbedgia   a ruthless russian mobster  
the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents  vinnie  robbie gee   sol  lennie james  and portly tyrone  ade   that goes miserably awry  
meanwhile  a couple of young toughs  turkish  jason stratham  and tommy  stephen graham   are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top  alan ford   who also owns a pig farm  
when their first fighter is put out of action  with one punch  by a wild irish gypsy named mickey oneil  they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight  
mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommys deal  
brick top  impressed by mickeys performance  decides to gives them another chance  after calmly explaining that it takes  pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse  
when avi doesnt get his precious rock  he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend   bullet tooth  tony  vinnie jones   to find frankie and the diamond  
things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of doublecross and doubledeals  and a dog that ate a squeaky toy  
guy ritchie  mr  madonna to some  is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters mouths like machine gun fire  
the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time  the above description by brick top being just one example  
the assemblage of actors and nonactors in roughandtumble settings gives  snatch  an earthy feel in its depiction of londons criminal underworld  
the cast of characters is too large to credit here  but two of the performances  first among equals  you might say  are worth noting  
alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless  evil brick top  
when he refuses sugar in his tea because  im sweet enough   it makes you shiver  even as you laugh  
his is one of the best gangster characters ive seen in years  
the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt  the name actor the movies popularity may hang upon  at least initially  
pitt  as mickey oneil  is hard drinking  hard fighting  highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers  the irish travelers of europe  
this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth  especially if it would benefit his beloved mum  sorcha cusack   
when brick top threaten the safety of mickeys family  he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped  
pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff  too  as a bareknuckle boxer  
the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni  producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim mauricejones  and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life  
there is a patent feel to the look of  snatch  and  lock  stock and two smoking barrels  that reeks of  signature  for ritchie  but im not sure how this will translate in his future works  
there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions  
nonetheless   snatch  is terrific sophomore effort  a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot  
i give it a b
