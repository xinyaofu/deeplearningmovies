i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate  cubas oscar nominee for best foreign film  directed by tomas gutierrez alea  who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo  memories of underdevelopment   
i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late s  it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition  
i knew then that memorias was probably a statesanctioned political missive  and now expect strawberry will follow suit  
fellow internetters  primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba  soc  culture  cuba   have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs  
i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party lineit probably looks like political criticism  but it aint so  
having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castros repressiveness  i cant conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution  and i cant imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement  
as kids say these days  duh   the revolutions current state needs no criticism  its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident  
the proper questions to put relate to castros legitimacy  
i bet the film takes castros power for granted  and that this or any other movie  produced under cubas state control  cannot question his right to run cubas political show  ongoing now for more than  years   
thats why i just cant believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime  
lets see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up  
i saw the filmtwice  
i was right  castro remained intact  
strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young  dialectic materialist   as he describes himself  and a homosexual photographer  diego  in  cuba  
the young man  david  is the son of peasants  a symbol of the revolutions reason for being  
grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education  he studies political science instead of literature  his avocation  because he perceives it is his duty  
therein lies a likely unintended irony  since cuba has no need for political theoreticians  
cubas government is castro  
diegos lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life  
he enjoys the finer thingstea  opera  art  
he does not do  voluntary work  for the revolution  
his small apartment is a sensual oasis  
the moniker  bourgeois  figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie  
however  he is a  revolucionario  in his own way  
the supporting roles are filled by  an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche  davids roommate  who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme  davids exgirlfriend  who dumped him for another guy  yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband  german  a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit  and who strikes a faustian pact with the government  
gutierrez alea and codirector juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too  
heck  towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor  
he really loves the revolution  as supposedly does everybody else in cuba  and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws  
real criticism is missing though  
this movie is political window dressing  
luis aguilar leons op  
ed  
piece on fresa in the miami herald   march   at a  did not color my judgment  it presaged my intuition  
aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this films political angle best  like many artistic manifestations in cuba  strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment  
as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes  the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept  the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point  while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point   
although terrible propaganda  this is otherwise a fine film
