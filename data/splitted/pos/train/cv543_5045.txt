getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity  
the film was directed by randal kleiser  who brought us such bubblegum classics as grease and the blue lagoon  
but thanks to kleisers surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script  getting it right is a pleasantly quiet  moving  and memorable filmone geared strictly toward a sophisticated  adult audience  
getting it right stars jesse birdsall  emily lloyds boyfriend in wish you were here  as gavin  a painfully shy yearold hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and whogaspis still a virgin  
gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon  but expose him to a single yearold beauty and hes a mess  
much to gavins surprise  the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan  lynn redgrave   a rich  married  and lonely yearold  
getting it right is the simple story of gavins awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right  that is  to find the right woman to fulfill his life  
getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to indepth character development  
gavins selfconscious voiceover narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche  
we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and selfconfident maturity  
birdsalls superb  understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film  he seems convincing and authentic throughout  
the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavins life  
despite her limited screen time  redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavins middleaged seducer  
for a supporting character  joan is unusually and impressively complex  thanks in large part to redgraves magnificent performance  
gavin is also pursued  or perhaps plagued  by minnie  the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat  
after minnie and gavin meet at a party  she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life  
helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role  and sir john gielgud  with his tongue in his cheek  embodies the height of arrogance as her father  
gavins eventual loveinterest is jenny  the adorable twentyyearold single mother who assists him at the beauty salon  london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character  
peter cook  the great british satirist  appears briefly in the film as gavins uptight employer  
the scenes of gavins home life with his parents are also a treat  
gavins overprotective mother  pat heywood   whom even woody allen would find overbearing  almost steals the movie  
her life seems limited to just two activities  treating gavin like a yearold and preparing exotic but inedible meals  such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce  
gavin and his fathers attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing  
getting it right  for the most part  is very wellcrafted  except for two minor shortcomings  
first  the movie is about  minutes too long  and consequently it loses momentum at times  
second  the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavins best friend  harry  and his unfaithful lover  winthrop  
overall  however  getting it right is quite memorable for its humor  depth  sophistication  and outstanding acting  
director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard  adapting her own highly acclaimed novel  deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth  maturation  and selfdiscovery
