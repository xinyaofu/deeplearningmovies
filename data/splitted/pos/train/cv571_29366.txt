had  hedwig and the angry inch  came out in the s  right after david bowies  ziggy stardust   it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time  
released in the  channel  sensory overload world of   however  the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed offbroadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention  
i almost missed it  
every august  the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once  
i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like  summer catch  and  bubble boy  that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run  
but an email from a reader asking why i hadnt reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater  
thank goodness for readers like him  
  hedwig and the angry inch  is a genderbending glamrock spectacular packed with great songs  
stylistically  the hookladen tunes are reminiscent of bowie   bat out of hell  era meatloaf and  the rocky horror show   without ever seeming like imitations  
as with  tommy    hedwig  tells a story of isolation  pain and defiance  but without the bloated feel of that beloved  but overrated rock opera  
writerdirectorstar john cameron mitchell and composerlyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner  
mitchell stars as hedwig  a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u  s  coffee shops with her panslavic band  the angry inch  
while the patrons of the rundown restaurants look on in shock  and sometimes horror  hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song  
she was once a boy named hansel  ben mayergoodman   living with his mother  alberta watson  and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio  
life is an exercise in duality for hansel  
a wall splits his hometown into two parts  
mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half  
as hansel grows up  the duality becomes more pronounced  
after initially mistaking him for a girl  a gi from the states  maurice dean wint  falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him  
alas  hansel will never pass the mandatory physical  
mother helpfully suggests a sex change  but the operation goes bad  hence the references to  the angry inch   yes  i know this part is squirminducing  but stick with me  its worth it   
several years later  mr  right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig  decked out in a farrah fawcettstyle wig and fronting a band made up of korean women  
hedwig finds a new love in tommy  michael pitt   a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity  
but tommy does hedwig wrong  stealing her songs and becoming a superstar  
cut to the present  
tommy gnosis stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him  
despite warnings from her manager  andrea martin  that she could easily be labeled a stalker  hegwig and her new band  the angry inch  continue their coffee shop tour  shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in  
if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical  take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of  tommy  and  rocky horror   
as hedwig  john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being  
mitchell has worldclass style and vocal chords to match  
even though the backstory is unusually strong  mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical  
everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and  trust me  these are fullfledged rock songs  not the overprocessed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals  
while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film  there is much of interest on the sidelines  
miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak  hedwigs lover and bandmate  conveying a great deal through expressions alone  
decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard  she makes a mighty attractive man  
as always   sctv  veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy  the angelicappearing little rat  
artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical  
  hedwig and the angry inch  surrounds a weird  funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast  
true originals do not come along very often  dont let this slip out of town without seeing it
