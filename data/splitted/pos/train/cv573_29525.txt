  the deep end  uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues  
alluring  attractive blues  but also icy and foreboding  
after taking in their beauty  the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens  like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land  
the production works that way as well  it pulls you in initially as a crisp  thoroughlymodern thriller  with clipped exchanges between defiantly noncommunicative characters  
but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as  the deep end  gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating  
spoiler alert  the following reveals the basic storyline  
i believe the plot points are incidental  because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters  but still  you should proceed at your own risk  
with her husband tom  a naval officer  often away at sea  margaret hall  tilda swinton  holds down the fort  taking care of the children  beau  jonathan tucker   paige  tamara hope   and dylan  jordon dorrance   while her fatherinlaw jack  peter donat  hovers in the background  always watching  
the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno  
it seems that beau  her eldest  is having an affair with darby reese  josh lucas   a disreputable sort  years his senior  
margaret demands that darby leave her son alone  only to have the man smirk at her and announce hell be glad to steer clear of beau  for   
back at home  she tries to talk about it all with her son  but the kid wont even confirm that hes gay  let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend  
he does  however  get attentive when she reveals darbys    offer  even as he maintains his sullen demeanor  
late in the evening  darby shows up outside  tossing pebbles at beaus window like a schoolchild  
the two meet by the water at the boathouse  where something important happens  
i wont reveal what  suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not  
all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie  by the way  
within a day or so  margarets life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic  turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby  
he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape  once margaret coughs up     
oh  whats a mother to do  
end spoilers 
written  directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel   suture     the deep end  is based on elisabeth sanxay holdings s novel   the blank wall   which was also the source of the  film   the reckless moment   
ive neither read the book nor seen the movie  but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details  
in holdings story  the  scandalous  relationship is between an older man and margarets teenage daughter  
switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary  and it also raises questions about margarets motives  
many reviews of  the deep end  describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son  but i wonder  
consider this  margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home  
her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a largerthanlife figure  
her fatherinlaw is constantly present  almost as if he is monitoring for his son  
and when her husband does call  margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family  
so is margaret a mother who accepts her sons sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him  
or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency  desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea  
you sort it out  
regardless  the resonance of  the deep end  comes from two actors  
goran visnjic  best known from the tv drama  er   is striking as a blackmailer unlike any youve seen before  
he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol  chivalry and simmering eroticism  
but the star of this show  without a doubt  is the remarkable tilda swinton  
watch the shadings  depth  resource  vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her  
days after my second viewing of  the deep end   i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains  trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water  
  the deep end  is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it
