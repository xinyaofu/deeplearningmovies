the happy bastards quick movie review 
me tarzan    you 
happy viewer  
for a minute there  i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disneys latest  another adaptation of a legend from the past  
  remember the pathetic pocahontas  
yikes   
but guess what disney  a company thats been on a roll lately with animated films  strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you  
the story is pretty basic tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla whos lost her young adopts him into her group  
as he matures into a much older man  tarzan still wonders just why hes so much different from the clan  and then arrives a hunter  a professor  and the professors lovely daughter  jane who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons  
from there  tarzan faces tough choices should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england  
the voicework here is pretty toplevel  
tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man  minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the alreadybeautiful jane  nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice  rosie o donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzans best ape friend terk  and wayne  newman  knight has his moments as a panicky elephant  
the movie is superb throughout  mixing a great script with incredible computerassisted visuals  
when tarzan treesurfs  a twist that was added on top of the same ol vine swinging and a great one  i might add   the camera twists and turns  allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly  
i couldnt believe my eyes disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast  
and the musics not half bad  either  
fortunately  theres no ridiculous singing characters here  just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood  
theres some great action sequences here as well  including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan  jane  and the aforementioned babboons  
but  of course  its not all action theres a message here as well that has to do with family  
this is easily one of disneys best animated films of the decade and its one i cant wait to put in my home library    that 
is  if my vcr still works in the year
