  say  any of you know how to madison   
 brad  asshole  majors  barry bostwick  shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early s  stage actor turned firsttime playwright richard obrien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy bmovies he had grown up with as a child  set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show  which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in  and was even hailed the best musical of  by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later  in october of   
the film version  now titled the rocky horror picture show  was released in     
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasnt quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didnt quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined  but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later  something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country  and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film  acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played  yelling rude comments at the screen  and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture shows life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware  the plot centers around a loving couple  brad majors  barry bostwick  and janet weiss  susan sarandon   who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting  dr  everett scott  jonathan adams  who played the narrator in the original stage version   but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road  they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual  in the galaxy of transylvania   who are lead by the eccentric fishnetstocking wearing mad scientist dr  franknfurter  tim curry   
franknfurter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky  peter hinwood   
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment  brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of franknfurters mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctors handyman  riffraff  original author richard obrien   and domestic  magenta  patricia quinn   are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years   being the first time i had ever seen it   it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release  i dont think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie  though bad in a really good sort of way   but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role  it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters  and one really gets the feeling that richard obrien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy bmovies his film is based on  
when i say that the walltowall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that  once you hear them  they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the  time warp  is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who havent seen the movie dont know though  is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is  over at the frankenstein place   but  dammit janet  is also maddeningly catchy  
tim currys vocals on the rocking tune  sweet transvestite  need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film  a big floor show staged by franknfurter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets  including barry bostwick    
frightening    features no less than four songs   rose tint my world    dont dream it    wild and untamed thing   and  im going home    all of which are immensely singable  
the films true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  
despite the catchiness of the songs  this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadnt have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans  unless you dont mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place   
note  director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film  in the form of a sequel  resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment  which picks up with brad and janet  this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper   as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton  
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager  also played by de young   who wishes to claim janet as his own  
obrien returned as a writerperformer on the project  as did quinn  campbell  and gray in performance capacity only   but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original  
 years later  this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world  
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans  a brand new special edition disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date  even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its th anniversary   
if you are one of those people who cant get enough of the film  this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film  fox home entertainment has released this wonderful disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that itll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of       enhanced for x televisions   
the film is presented in two different versions  the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called  superheroes   
for ambitious viewers  the disc also includes a hidden version  located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner  which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen  
originally  the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz  with the first half of the it seen in black and white  and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number   
most reports  including a documentary on the disc  say that the color was supposed to appear when franknfurter first shows up in the elevator  but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version  depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced  
the film contains a commentary track by show creator  and faithful handyman  richard obrien and costar patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable  and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and halfnaked on freezing cold sets  which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews   
the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell  but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore  and there are quite a few   
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments  
the first feature  and the most simple  is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is  
the second feature is an audience participation track  which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show  
most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off  but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter  
the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd  where a pair of lips will appear onscreen during certain scenes of the film  mostly during the musical numbers  that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote  
when selected  you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world  
once the segment is over  you are deposited right back into the film where you left off  
the first disc also contains a few dvdrom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player  
there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation  a video jukebox  a you dont know jackstyled trivia game  which is about as bare bones a you dont know jack parody as it can be   and a bizarre madlibs styled word game known as riffraffs story lab  
links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvdrom portion of the disc  
the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras  
former literock video channel turned music historians vh have allowed some of their outtake footage from the  behind the music  rocky horror  special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here  as well as a popup video for the meat loafsung  hot patootie   
the  behind the music  segments are all very interesting  especially richard obriens jaunt through the castle  which is now a hotel   where the film was originally shot  
there are also extensions of the sarandon  bostwick  quinn  obrien  and meat loaf interviews  
as far as extras for the film itself go  there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here  
one of which is just the  superheroes  number available in the uk version  but there is also another rare musical number presented here called  once in a while   
a series of alternate takes are also presented here  but none of them are really much of a revelation  except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwicks pants   
for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia  a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here  
rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show  two theatrical trailers  proclaiming that the film is  a different sort of jaws    a still gallery  and two singalongs  for  toucha toucha touch me  and  sweet transvestite    
foxs special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives   youre lucky    
im lucky    
hes lucky    
were all lucky     
its not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u  s   but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format  
as with their excellent dvds of the abyss  fight club  independence day  and the sound of music  fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want  
i raise a toast to them  cue the throwing of the bread  as i cut out the lights  sit back  and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about bmovie tradition
