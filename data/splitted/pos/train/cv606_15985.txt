comments   star trek  the next generation  was a hugely successful sequel tv series to  star trek   a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the s  
even though it still enjoyed high ratings   star trek  the next generation  ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original  star trek  s cast in paramounts film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  
star trek  insurrection is the ninth  star trek  movie and the third to focus on the  star trek  the next generation  crew  
star trek  insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans  such as myself  would rate somewhere between  okay  and  good   
after star trek v  the final frontier  a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant  star trek  voyager  tv series   star trek  fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise  
i dont wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies  
most people reading this probably havent followed  star trek  anyway  so a comparison would seem tedious at best  
let me  thus  make my comparisons briefly so that its out of my system  star trek  insurrection is not as good as the previous installment  star trek  first contact  star trek  insurrections comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv  the voyage home  star trek ii  the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  
okay  lets move to the movie itself  
star trek  insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise  humanitys exploration and colonization of space  with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  
this combination works well more often than it fails  but when it does fail  the humor really seems cheesy  
much of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprises crew  
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times  
star trek  insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the baku homeworld  
forget the actors and special effects  the beautiful setting of this movie  with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys  steals the show  
this tranquility  however  is broken by data  an android  who reveals to the baku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies  the sona  
it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth  sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young  healthy state  
the enterprise crew  led by captain picard  investigates datas actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the sona and an enterprise admiral to relocate the baku and plunder the planets youthrestoring properties  
sound pretty heavy  
it is  though this plot  anything but unique and groundbreaking  is undermined by the films constant barrage of humor  
when going after data  for instance  picard sings an opera piece with him  this is supposed to be cute and humorous   
in a much more funny sequence  work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the baku homeworld  a pimple which his crewmates  try as they might  cannot avoid looking at  
the acting in star trek  insurrection is  for the most part  pretty good  
since theyve been playing these characters for years  those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough  
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers a moral speech  picards trademark  with his usual aplomb  
brent spiner  another fine actor  plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film  though the old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series   
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good  
despite many other critics negative opinions  f  murray abraham  the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus  plays the major villain ruafro well enough  
ruafro reminds me  somewhat  of the baron harkonnen in the  film version of dune  
like the baron  ruafro continuously has his skin looked after  it is stretched and stapled by servants  
in one particularly memorable scene  ruafro becomes very agitated  and his facial skin splits open and bleeds  
ruafro is no khan from star trek iithe best trek villain everbut he is much better than the forgettable dr  soran from star trek  generations  
  okay  i promise  no more comparisons   
donna murphy must also be noted as a baku woman  anij  who picard falls in love with  
murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body  she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance  
this is the type of woman whom picard  for those who know the character well  would be enchanted with  
in fact  the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here  
a particular plot point involving anijs ability to slow time down  an ability which she shares with picard  becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie  
for as good as the actors and setting were  star trek  insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing  
they proved adequate  sometimes barely  for a s mainstream science fiction film  but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars  the phantom menace  a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection   
the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships  in particular  seemed trite and unsuspenseful  and the final confrontation between picard and ruafro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite  
the new enterprise itself  only seen in this film and its predecessor  remains largely unexplored  though its exterior doesnt look quite right for a reason i cannot explain  
despite star trek  insurrections frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects  i enjoyed the film  
it maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors  particularly star trek  first contact  though  dont get me wrong  the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully   
id recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon  especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general  
rated pg  i cant see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience  young or old
