in the wake of the smashing success of  rumble in the bronx   its looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc  its widescreen and bilinguallysubtitled  as are most hong kong films these days  
availability over here in the united states is very limited  these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read  the letters are white and a bit small  
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed  this review is of the subtitled version  so please keep that in mind if youre reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  
to be fair  i must admit that ive never been very fond of  periodpiece  martial arts moviesthe ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  
perhaps its because most of those ive seen were filmed on inferior stock  with either butchered dubbing or allbutillegible subtitling  or perhaps its because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and  in many cases  all but nonexistant  
in fact  many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  
or  for that matter  it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings  armour of god  rumble in the bronx  etc   tend to have more spectacular stunts  often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions  whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  
having said that  i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above  is one of the better martial arts films ive seen  and i quite enjoyed it  
surprised  
well  so was i  
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong feihong  played by jackie chan  who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  
where he learned this style is uncertain  as his father  wong keiying  ti lung  is steadfast in his opposition to feihongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  
apparently  feihong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore  rather like paul bunyan is for americans  but ive heard very little about this  and could quite well be wrong  so ill leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  
one of my friends points out that the character of wong feihong is also featured in the  once upon a time in china  movies  but i have not yet seen those  
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy  as are the plots to many such films  but if youre watching a jackie chan film  odds are you arent expecting something on the order of  war and peace   
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics  and hence  chinas cultural heritage  while overworking  underpaying  and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  
however  this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the filmfeihongs perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend  supplicate his father  keep his  pregnant  mother  played by anita mui  from fighting  and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  
the macguffin that drives the plot  s  is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  
in the beginning  feihong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicallywrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  
in the process  he clashes with another thief  who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  
after feihong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies  thanks to some timely intervention by a generals son  a cameo appearance by andy lau  who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii    comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when feihong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  
and so it goes  
and the plot thickens later on  such as when feihongs girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival  or when feihong and the thief  now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners  are attacked en masse  another grand kungfu movie tradition   but i think ive already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  
lets move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the 
action  
theres plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of 
course  in a kung fu film  thats to be expected  
however  this isnt just another kung fu movie  this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography  and jackie chan is a genius  
the primary martial arts  style  featured in the film is drunken boxing  a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  
further  for the purposes of this film at least  drunken boxers fight better when they actually are intoxicated    but 
theres a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor  
under normal circumstances  the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid  but jackie pulls it off with flair  
the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper  so ill just say that the fightsespecially the big climactic fight at the endin themselves make the movie worth watching  
another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work  
even without motor vehicles  well  not counting a train   there are some remarkable stunts in this film  
among other things  jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals  not once  but at least twice  if you count the outtake shown during the credits   
  quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database   
unlike in american films  these stunts are not faked  
drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene  including jackie  ti lung   a better tomorrow       and anita mui  the  heroic trio  series   rumble in the bronx    
the performances are firstrate  especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film  
the scene where feihong and his mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious  as is the scene where feihongs mother  having just revealed that she is pregnant  is threatening to hurt herself  in order to draw her husbands anger away from feihong   
jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years  and hes in fine form all through drunken master ii  
as far as cinematography is concerned  it certainly works for this film  
its nothing spectacular  but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the s  
the picture is crisp and clear  
one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that  at least in the copy i have  the screen was wider than any film ive ever seen on videotape beforealmost a whole  of the screen was blocked out above and below  
  watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can   
it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually panandscanned for american video release  
drunken master ii shows the full potential of  period piece  kung fu movies  and its good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies  
the plot does meander a bit  but thats to be expected in this type of film  
if you like this kind of movie  youll love this movie  and if not  well  give it a chance anyway  
if nothing else  the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental
