mickey mouse had better watch his back  theres a new critter in town  and hes the nameless animal attraction of  mouse hunt   dreamworks skgs clever first foray into family fare  
although it runs out of steam towards its end  this liveaction comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disneys entire  nonanimated  kiddieoriented catalog    
but consider that list includes dismal tripe like  air bud    flubber  and  that darn cat   and its really not such a difficult feat to pull off  
still  throw the two rodents in a boxing arena  and ill be hoping that the mouse from  mouse hunt  knocks some sense back into mickey  
nathan lane  robin williams significant other from  the birdcage   and lee evans  last seen as a nervous bellhop in  the fifth element   play ernie and lars smuntz  befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father  william hickey  in his last role   a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion  
although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former  he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect  
but theres a lone obstacle in their way  a single mouse lives within the walls of the house  and hes not about to give up his place of residence without a fight  
movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite  
the effects blending the talents of some live mice  one animatronic mouse and one computergenerated mouse are pretty seamless  
the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burtons mind  the smuntzs architecturallyunsound mansion is like something straight out of  the nightmare before christmas   and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent prices warped contraptions from  edward scissorhands   
  mouse hunt  is a pretty dark movie  even some of the humor can be grim  but its hardly ever meanspirited  
the star of the show is neither the topbilled lane nor the titular mouse  
its lanky british comedian evans  whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleanedup jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill  note a toneddown but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease   evans banter with the everaffable lane is funny stuff  too  and holds its own against the movies more flashy physical shtick  
vicki lewis  beth from  newsradio   is solid in a supporting role as lars moneygrubbing wife  
and in a nifty bit of novelty casting  christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously  popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a  calcium deficiency   
blech  
a basically onejoke idea  a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans  is given a rather engaging execution  
their sparring is imaginatively realized  i dont think ill ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda   and although you really never fully root for either side  thats okay  a warmandfuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share  
  mouse hunt  may take a while to get going  the rather lengthy setup could test the patience of some of the younger children  although i rather liked it  much in part to lane and evans   and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long  but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable  not unlike the original  home alone
