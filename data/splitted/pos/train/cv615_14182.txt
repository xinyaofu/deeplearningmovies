a miracle of filmmaking   some like it hot  is a brilliant film  and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists  
it is the pinnacle of writerdirector billy wilders career  a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make  
jerry  lemmon  and joe  curtis  are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig  trying to earn enough money to feed themselves  
one night  as theyre playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy  the place is raided  
as it turns out  the owner  spats columbo  george raft  was ratted out by toothpick charlie  george e  stone   
several weeks later  on valentines day  jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage  
eager to escape  the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid  
the only catch   its a girls band  
so josephine  curtis  and daphne  lemmon   make their way onto the train and go to florida  
on the way there  they meet sugar kane  monroe   a bombshell singer who is looking for love  
jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer  but theres two problems    theyre in drag  and   millionaire osgood fielding  joe e  brown  falls madly in love with daphne  
what follows in pure hysteria  still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the  italian opera lovers festival   
tony curtis is hysterical as joejosephine  especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar  
marilyn monroe  in a wonderfully comic performance  is sugar  providing incredible timing and sex appeal  along with true sincerity  
the scenes  however  are all stolen by either brown or lemmon  
lemmon is hysterical as daphne  
cast as the less rational one  lemmons performance is ridiculously crazy  it is disorder in the style all billy wilders  
brown is particularly hilarious as osgood  as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony  
he manages to use lemmons ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire  
every setpiece is flawless  as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly  and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture  
wilders script is stunning  as he carefully combines gangsters  crossdressing  romance  sex  music  gender roles  and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness  
wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria  so pitchperfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece  the final line of this absolutely incredible film  
wilders is dead wrong when he says nobodys perfect  billy wilder is  especially when he makes something this disastrously funny  
nobodys perfect but billy wilder
