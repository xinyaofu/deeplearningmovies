this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in   
whether it was the meddling of studio executives  or the work of writerdirector james cameron himself  the original cut of this underwater scifi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed  
the main problem was fairly simple  the films climax was unworthy of its buildup  
someone at th century fox  and no doubt cameron himself  must have agreed  because in  came the theatrical release of the abyss  special edition  
now available on video  it seems timely to reevaluate what  in its newly revamped state  is now a nearmasterpiece despite its borrowings from films like   odyssey two  alien and close encounters of third kind  
the plot is thus  
we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hardnosed lindsay  mastrantonio  and captained by her soontobedivorced husband bud  ed harris   
the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u  s  nuclear submarine  
requiring a dive partway down a three mile deep trench  three navy divers arrive to command the operation  led by the edgy lieutenant coffey  biehn   
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever theyre dealing with  as she memorably puts it   arent speaking russian   
meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and  even worse  a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u  s  navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions  
this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig  with the triggerhappy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goingson around them  
the human drama is often riveting  with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in camerons aliens  
the stunts  hardware  special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding  
and so they should be  camerons technical credentials are well established  
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands    the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and exhubby bud    the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis befall them  and   the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss  
the abyss  special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects  
one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay  a relationship at times touching  at others incredibly intense and volatile  
the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the films end  when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war  
with the inclusion of these startling scenes  the storys climax is now given real weight  
why on earth were they left out of the original  
this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible  
so then  we have  minutes of additional footage thats turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent  
i say  quite  because some flaws do remain  
the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz  some new  some old  that may well have you reaching for the barf bag  
nonetheless  the abyss  special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james camerons greatest achievements  alongside aliens and terminator   see it and be moved  gripped and spellbound
