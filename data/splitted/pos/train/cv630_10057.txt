it was a crazy time in france  what with the french revolution right around the corner  
king louis xv would soon die  and his son would become king louis xvi  
such is the setting for beaumarchais  the scoundrel about the controversial playwright  spy and playboy pierreaugustin caron de beaumarchais  
beaumarchais was the author of the plays   the barber of seville  and  the marriage of figaro   
today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas  but  back in  when the movie takes place  they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once  
the movie beaumarchais  the scoundrel takes a lighthearted approach to its subject  resulting in an inviting motion picture  
one of frances most expensive productions ever  the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year  
now in theatrical release in the united states  it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story  
the secret of the films success  other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzacs costumes  has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais  
with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile  he mesmerizes the camera and the audience  
his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning  
in a land where court intrigue determines ones destiny  constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy  
as our story starts  we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship  
into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight  
beaumarchais  who has been having an affair with the mans wife  makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided  
that over with  the fight is on  
with luchinis charisma  it is hard to root for anyone other than him  
audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert  in which he played the attorney  
although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin  played by manuel blanc  he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style  
michael epps warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jeanmarc kerdelhues lush but realistic looking sets  
jeanclaude petits music  especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos  make for an enchanting time at the movies  
director jeanclaude brisville  who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro  fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which  according to the press notes  was just a series of historic vignettes  
the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie  but the actors smooth it over with their goodhearted style  
typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water  taking his bath  
one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man  
another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution  
all of this may sound like a dull historical drama  but it is anything but  
the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts  
the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marietherese  the real love of beaumarchaiss life  
but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him  
still  with his beguiling smile  one can never quite be sure if you should trust him  
the movie  on the other hand  can be trusted to deliver a high old time  
beaumarchais  the scoundrel runs     
it is in french with english subtitles  
the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex  and should be fine for most teenagers
