we all know the fate of  childs play   which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially  sequel hell  
with the newest installment in the quasipopular series currently out  that would be  bride of chucky   and it grossed  million in its opening weekend  which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five   its kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original  a task which is a retread for some  and for others  namely myself  a chance to see what all the fuss was about  
alas  the original  childs play  actually isnt that bad  
even seeing it in the tiny  claustrophobic  and mechanicallychallenged theatre at my college wasnt the horribly dull experience i thought it would be  not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd  which you almost need to watch a film like this  and if you dont believe me  try and watch this flick by yourself one day   but because as a whole  this isnt a bad movie  
its not great  but it does have two things that many horror films like this one dont have    a rather nifty premise  and   a sense of humor  both which save this from horror hell  which is precisely where  say   i know what you did last summer  has recently gone  
the premise of  childs play  is that a serial killer named charles lee ray  brad douriff  is shot and almost killed by a chicago hardboiled detective  chris surrandon  see what happens to some oscar nominees    and before he dies  utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kids doll called chucky  a doll which has got to be the scariestlooking kids doll ive ever seen  
the next day  a bum whos stolen it sells it to singlemother karen barclay  catherine hicks   who then gives it to her young son andy  alex vincent  for his birthday  
of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll  but certain twists come up  
like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll  that being andy  
and soon enough  chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun  and people are discovering that chucky isnt just a kiddie doll one by one  
the idea is a neat one  ripe for lots of comic terror  and luckily it utlizes a lot of that  
it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive  they tell people about it  but when he tries to prove themselves  chucky does nothing  and everyone thinks theyre crazy  
it plays with this  as well as the whole childlike thought that dolls and toys come to life  and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments  
even if theres an entire sequence devoted to cliches  a woman alone in a house hears a noise  goes to investigate it  and finds nothing  but wait for the kicker a second later    
theres also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat  and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes  leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience  
the ending is rather fun  as well  albeit a tad too drawnout  about four different endings  maybe five   and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film lineup  making them easier to sympathize with  
if theres one horrible thing about many horror films  its that the protagonists are morons who you cant help but shout obscenities at  and for the most part   childs play  steers away from that  
and most of all  the chucky character is a good one  not just because he provides instant comic relief  look  
that dolls moving on its own    but because hes a generally scary character  
if theres anything really wrong with  childs play   its that its too trite and has too less self esteem  
at almost  minutes   childs play  features way too less to be a real classic of horror  
it throws itself into a simple three act setup that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it werent for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll  
if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting  it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism  which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film    which 
isnt necessarily a bad thing  
as such   childs play  is content to be just the short  typical horror film  but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasicampy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short  typical horror film
