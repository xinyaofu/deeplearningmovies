long review  
i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film  
i didnt believe that they  mike myers and dana carvey  could hold it up for an hour and a half  i figured that perhaps the first halfhour would be great  and the rest would be  fluff   
however  i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film  with the exception of the ending  
  which i wont discuss for obvious reasons  but its not  that  bad   
story  the plot was quite thin  but it really wasnt that noticeable  because of the rapidfire jokes that myers wrote in  
alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots   in being very  parodyish   
  okay  bad term   
extremely witty throughout  although  as in hot shots  it got a bit repetitive in the middle  
acting  as in many comedies  the acting isnt really  that  important  
however  myers turns in a good performance as wayne  playing the character perfectly   although i still liked him better back on much music  in a more  canadian  type of mode   
carvey is okay as garth  but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne  
tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra  playing it very stilted  
lowe is fine as ben oliver  but is nothing to write home about  
without a doubt  this movie is mike myers all the way  
direction  spheeris is a classic  music  movie director  making dudes  and decline of western civilization ii  the metal years  
  she also directed the boys next door  which is different  to say the least   
she is very capable  knows how direct a comedy  the correct camera movements it instill laughs  etc  one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy  
overall  i would suggest to anyone that likes snls skits to go see this film in the theatres  
however  my personal opinion  as in most comedies  is that they work just as well on video  
you definately have to be fan of music  and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film  
without a doubt  this is the best comedy so far this year  
itll make tons o dough for everyone involved  
lets just hope they make a thousand sequels  
sorry  i had to get the lame joke in    
forgive me
