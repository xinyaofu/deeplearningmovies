the bond series is an island in the film world  where else would we look forward to cliches  and all of the other things that occur in most of these films  
where else would pure escapism  a vulnerable hero  the  talking villains   blatant product placement  predictable action sequences  and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change  
i dont understand it myself  but thats what the bond series is based on  
for  i think   films  weve mostly got the same thing over and over again  with some variation  and a bit of change  most notably in the two dalton films   
but even i  a king of cynicism  cant bitch about it  
and  tomorrow never dies   the  again  i think  eighteenth bond film  and second brosnan bond film  is no exception  
thank god  
the plot  as in most of them  is pure balderdash  but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it  
instead of just plain billionaire psychotics  we get a rupert murdochesque media mogulpsychotic  elliot carver  jonathan pryce  looking bitching with a whitehaired cru cut  and always talking like hes out of breath   who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war  
no  this is not  wag the dog   he wants a real war  between china and england  and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it    in 
comes bond  
james is sent all around the world  trying to do research on carver  fighting with his men  and running into  on more than one occasion  a chinese secret agent like him  wai lin  michelle yeoh  asian action star extraordinaire    and 
costar of  supercop   nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one   
the two eventually  and predictably of course  begin working together  and yes  there is some sexual tension between the two  
luckily  their relationship is never strained  and she never gives into his cassanovaness until the finale  
thank god again  
in every bond film  james bags  on average  three women  sometimes more  sometimes less  the latter being more potent towards the aidscautionary dalton   and he doesnt spoil this one  though we never see them  of course  i mean  they need to stay around a pg rating   
theres always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again  the big bond girl  yeoh   and this time we have an almostcameo by teri hatcher as carvers wife  paris  who  it seems  was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning  
yes  teris very attractive  but she seems kind of dull  
of course  its not really her fault  her part is underwritten  and shes only in a small part of it  
oh well  
and there are always the big henchmen  the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains  
this time we get a tall  arianlooking  not to mention robert shaw in  from russia with love  looking  guy named stamper  goetz otto   who is pretty awesome  although a bit stiff  well  mostly his posture  really   
and for a bit of comedy  we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point  
the government people have small parts  as usual  with q  desmond llewelyn  looking near death  sadly  getting only one scene  in a more grouchy mood than usual   and m  judi dench   getting more than m usually gets  i mean  it is judi dench   
and for no reason whatsoever  except cause he was so good in  goldeneye   joe don baker shows up again as wade  admitting he has no reason for being there  and is this time more annoying  
again  oh well  
the action sequences are not a letdown  although sometimes go on too long  
they pop up every now and then  mainly because they have to  for the sake of the series   and some significant ones are the opening one  one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control  and a motorcylce chase  on a bmw cycle  nonetheless  through china streets  or was it vietnam    the 
plots not really essential   
theyre more hightech  and feature much more laughs  which  yeah  i dig  
so what if theyre distracting  theyre supposed to be  
the acting  from most around is great  
yeoh is  actually  one of the better bond girls  mainly because shes so unique  
the better bond girls are more independent  and have a certain wilyness to them  
pussy galore  with her homoerotic undertones and all  is one of the best  and diana rigg  who married bond at the end of  on her majestys secret service  only to be killed  added some emotional depth  
yeoh is notable since shes so active  and has great chemistry with brosnan  
pryce is an awesome villain  being slimy and lovable at the same time  
and brosnan is  once again  the mack daddy  
the bond series is built on cliches  mainly because theyre so fun and add to the escapism  
if you can remember the dalton years  and theyre serious direction  you remember how unsuccessful they were  both financially and aesthetically  
the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot  too many themes  and too much characterization  
i dont really understand it myself  yet im one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states  
having seen all of them more than once  yes  ive seen this twice already   you can tell i adore them  
while its not one of the best  like  goldfinger  or  from russia with love    tomorrow never dies  is nonetheless a truly awesome installment  even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones
