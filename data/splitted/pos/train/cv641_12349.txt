john sayles  men with guns  is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power  
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country  where the men with guns are the rulers  
most of the country is divided into tiny segments  some are controlled by guerrillas with guns  some are controlled by army soldiers with guns  and all the spaces inbetween are controlled by thieves  bandits  and terrorists  
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness  
however  like so many central american countries  this one also features modernity  
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization  skyscrapers  hospitals  televisions  highways  etc  but  it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land  or else they are simply ignorant of it  
the films main character  dr  fuentes  federico luppi  falls into the latter category  
one of his patients  an army general  describes him as the most educated man he has ever met  and also the most naive  
fuentes is a true liberal  a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians  
with government assistance  he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate  
this program was to be his legacy  and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea  
however  when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot  g  s  he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned  
as he travels deeper into the forest  going from village to village  the story is always the same  the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers  usually for helping the other  
when dr  fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors  she replies simply   because they had guns  and we didnt   
rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns  because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power  
dr  fuentes picks up several companions during his journey  all of whom are characterized by their loss  
first  there is a young boy named conejo  dan rivera gonz  lez   who has neither a mother nor a father  
next  fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo  dami  n delgado   who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities  
through his ordeal in the army  domingo has lost most of his selfrespect  and defines himself only by his pistol  
along the way  the group also picks up padre portillo  dami  n alc  zar   a priest who has lost his faith  
as domingo is running from the army  so is portillo  he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer  and ran away from the village in which he was preaching  
last  the group takes on a mute girl named graciela  tania cruz   who hasnt spoken since she was raped two years earlier  her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her  
sayles two major strengths as a director  characters and setting  are abundantly evident in  men with guns   
  like many of his films  sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room  but a longerthannecessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor   
he creates fascinating  complex characters  especially dr  fuentes and domingo  
their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the films overarching theme of violence as power  domingos attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded  at first it is  but later is isnt   
the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself  
sayles knows how to bring a location to life  whether it be an early twentiethcentury coal mining town in  matewan     or a contemporary texasmexico bordertown in  lone star      
sayles is not a particularly inventive director  he likes to let his actors do most of the work  but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak   gattaca   successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain  
sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico  using all latin american actors  and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects  
the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief  but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border  
it would not be a stretch to say that  men with guns  is a depressing film  
in fact  the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure  
in addition to loss  the main characters are also failures at something  whether that be dr  fuentes failure to change anything through medicine  or padre portillos inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being  
nevertheless  it is bleak material sayles has chosen  and he deals with it accordingly  
the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope  even in a world where  as one character puts it   nobody refuses the men with guns
