finding the courage to face life fullon is a difficult task  
summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job  
if youre a total jerk like melvin udall is  the odds are even more against you  
melvin  jack nicholson  is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be  
a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship  he avoids the outside world as much as possible  
his obsessivecompulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk  
  theres a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles  verysmall mosaic tiles   
melvin has some great lines  
when his publishers receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books  he responds  i think of men and i take away reason and accountability   
dont get him wrong  hes not merely a misogynist  
setting his sights higher than that  hes also a homophobe  racist  antisemite  xenophobe  animalhater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors  
when we first meet him  hes busy dumping a neighbors dog down the garbage chute  
hes an equal opportunity bigot  
he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe  
melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly  helen hunt  is the only one willing to wait on him  
and shes none too happy about it  
when carol doesnt show up for work  melvins routine is shot and hes determined to do something about it  
tracking down her address  he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast  
the fact that shes a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesnt appear to phase him  he wants his food  
much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop  greg kinnear  is brutally attacked during a robbery  
this doesnt upset melvin much   dont worry  youll be back on your knees in no time   but when he is bullied into taking care of simons dog  his life is turned topsyturvey  
melvin is sequestered because hes afraid of whats out there on the other side of his apartment door  
he has to make sure its ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side  
when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it  talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes  
this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up  
hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him  he pays for a specialist to treat her son  
he even develops a friendship with simon  
all three people are heavily damaged  
melvin has retreated from life in his apartment  
carol has devoted herself to her son  convinced that she has to give up her life for him  
simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out  
a more unlikely trio to form relationships  youd rarely see  
and in the midst of it all  there are some wonderful moments  
melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice  
  you make me want to be a better man   he tells her  
one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up  he is still a curmudgeon  
carol  afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him  
it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet tshirt contest  
theres hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson  
i dont remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his overtheedge melvin is no disappointment  
nicholson may be the best actor working today  
hunt does a commendable job matching nicholsons energy  
she isnt afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted rundown carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is topnotch  
their onscreen chemistry is a bit odd  
each does a wonderful job with the character  but together  theres something a little off  
its a minor problem  they do work well together  but that missing element is what prevents this from being a fourstar film  
director james l  brooks   terms of endearment    broadcast news   has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful  nominees for all the top golden globes  winners from the national board of review  inevitable oscars  and has a winner on his hands  
  as good as it gets  isnt exactly the quality that the title says  but its pretty darn close  
  michael redman has written this column for over  years and as soon as he finishes this one  hes off to an annual  night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm  
this year its in the sixties and raining  
that wacky el nino
