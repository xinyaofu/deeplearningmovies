if youve ever perused my college comedy diary  another year in the life of a nerd   i never run out of cheap plugs   you know i didnt get along with my firstsemester roommate too well  
in fact  during the threeweek period between thanksgiving and christmas break  i said a total of four sentences to him  
so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates  i envisioned  minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a  x  foot dorm room  
then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk  
scratch that idea  
but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal  
of course  in my case it would be a silent picture  
even without the college element  i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do  unless you count studying for final exams  and who does    
im glad i did  
peter falks performance was actually what made the movie  
and this is a guy i never considered a real actor  more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries  
falk pleasantly surprised me here  permanently earning my respect  so all you  columbo  fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off  
falk plays rocky  a yearold polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kids parents die  
the movie begins with the moms death and the son moving in with his grandparents  
after a couple stops along the sons journey to manhood  roommates progresses to the present day  with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave  
the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution  rocky will have to move into his place  the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students   communists     
the movie spans nine more years of rockys relationship with his grandson  and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love withgaspa woman  and starts spending all his time with her  
so  in his grandsons absence  rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing  achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed    
or am i confusing movie plots again  
roommates has an almost epic feel to it  covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die  
death  though  knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie  
roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween  
the number cant be counted on one hand  unless of course youre the victim of some hideous genetic mutation  
and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie  no  not duran duran   
i wont come out and say it  
instead  ill just sit here and hum  eye of the tiger  until each and every one of you figures it out  
roommates plays on all the major emotions  
it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry  
movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience  even though this one bombed at the theaters  
my point  
there are no absolutes  
or  another possible point  peter falk just isnt such a great box office draw  
either way  this is still a good movie and you should give it a chance like i did  whether you hate your roommate or not
