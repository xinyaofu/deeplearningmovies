three things i learned from  being john malkovich   when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the  th floor of a building  always bring your crowbar  dont stand in the way of your wifes actualization as a man  and  whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being  wear old clothes  because  hey  its muddy in there  
  being john malkovich  is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  
wildly surrealistic  yet presented in a downtoearth  funky style  this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline  you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it  
from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself  theres a lot to think about here  
just dont forget to have fun  
clearly  all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did  starting with writer charles kaufman  
  i wrote being john malkovich without an outline   he explains in the press notes   blindly  with no sense of direction or purpose  
its important to me that i dont have a map before i start  
this allows me to surprise myself  stay engaged  discover things  and  hopefully  allow the unconscious to surface   
spike jonze  mark wahlbergs na  ve buddy in  three kings   takes it from there  
the whitehot director of the beastie boys  sabotage   an awardwinning parody of s tv cop shows  as well as numerous other music videos and commercials  eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut  
jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a lowkey style  
his flat  matteroffact approach works perfectly  
and then theres the cast  
john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz  a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive  but decidedly erotic puppet shows  
over the years  his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte  cameron diaz  has devolved  
once passionate lovers  the two are now little more than courteous roommates  
financially strapped  craig takes a job as an entrylevel file clerk at lestercorp  located on the  th floor of a manhattan building  
navigating around dr  lester  orson bean   his  yearold boss and floris  mary kay place   lesters dotty secretary  craig tries to settle into his new position  but two things keep him distracted  
first  theres the beautiful and imperious maxine  catherine keener   who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her  
and then theres the hole behind the file cabinet  which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich  
craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich  where they can experience life from his point of view  with enough concentration  you can even influence his actions   
after  minutes  the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike  
then things get a little weird  
by the way  if youre concerned that i gave away too much of the plot  rest assured   i barely scratched the surface  
one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre setup  
instead  he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich  rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another persons identity  
he also examines the consequences of the malkovisits to craig  lotte  maxine and  of course  john malkovich himself  
the performances are superb  
malkovich  best known to mainstream audiences for his work in  dangerous liaisons    in the line of fire   and as head psychopath in the guiltypleasure  con air   tweaks his own image in a dandy selfdeprecating turn  
far from his effete  vaguely reptilian persona  this malkovich is just another schlub  drinking with his pals and trying to get laid  incidentally  charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his wellearned bad boy reputation   
as always  john cusack nails his part  handily pulling viewers along even as craigs actions become unconscionable  
the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz  both playing against type  
kenner  usually cast in icy subordinate roles  is terrific as a highly intelligent  extremely manipulative femme fatale  
cameron diaz  barely recognizable under a mess of brown  curly hair  sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich  
  being john malkovich  stumbles towards the end  as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots  
additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale  
regardless  this contemporary  alice in wonderland  is a real treat  
i enjoyed watching  being john malkovich   but only later  after reflecting on the film  did its resonance fully hit me  
at one point  craig says   do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is   
truer words were never spoken
