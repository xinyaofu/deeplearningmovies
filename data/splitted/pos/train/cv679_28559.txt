plot  a bigtime mommas boy cant seem to leave his mothers crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world  
he visits his kids  and their mommas  every now and then  but his main goal in life is    well  he doesnt have any goals  
then one day  his mother gets an exgangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isnt as welcome anymore in his own house  
it isnt long after that  that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well    its 
either time to grow up or bow down  
critique  first things first  
this movie aint about the  hood  at all  its an intelligent film about love  relationships  family  friendship  maturity and growing up  
do not avoid this film because you think its about gangbangers and stuff  because it isnt at all  
its about you  its about me  its about your girlfriend  your mother  your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to  well    grow 
up  
this is an extremely wellwritten film  with some of the most developed characters that ive seen on the screen all year  with superb acting performances to match  
granted  the film does start a little slow  and go a little long   but hang in there  because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters  you will be glad that you did  
this isnt a kids movie  
this is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full  adulthood  and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step  
i certainly did  because i too passed  and am passing  through many of these very same things right now  yeah  yeah  i still live with my momma    and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick  oh yeah  and for the record  im not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case   
but thats not even half the story  
you see  the film is damn funny  too    and 
i mean  damn funny  
i was crackin up at almost every other scene  and they werent  setup jokes  like your typical comedies either  just daytoday things that we could all relate to  like the scene in which ving rhames is  drinking koolaid  in the kitchen and his infamously improvised  african squat f   k  scene  which you just gotta see to believe   
and there are the performances  too  
ving rhames  now heres a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year  
damn dude  you scared the shit outta me  
tyrese gibson  i have no idea where this guy came from  an rb singer and mtv vj  you say    hmmmm    but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs  he nailed this part to the tee  
from scene one on  i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day  
and everyone else  too  
gibsons girlfriend in the film  taraji henson  made me a backer with her many subtle touches  all of which helped raise her character several levels above the  typical  bitchie girlfriend that weve seen in many of these relationship movies  
but thats the thing that i liked the most about this movie  
everyone seemed real  the situations felt authentic  the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears  
i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written  wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch  
and yeah  i even liked the whole homage to boyz n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end  he called this movie a  companion piece  to that film   
a very solid followup to an ever greater original  baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up  
note  the guy who plays jodys best friend in this movie is omar gooding  cuba gooding jr  s younger brother  cuba starred in s boyz n the hood   
wheres joblo coming from  
the best man     brothers     shaft     summer of sam     whats cooking
