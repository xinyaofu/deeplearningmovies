capsule  bleak and pointblank  just the way it should be  
makes its case with coldblooded precision and intelligence  
  serial killer chic  is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary  and one of the more stomachturning ones  
ive never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers  and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry  
i wasnt sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic heroantihero  
thankfully  thats not the way henry works  
the director  john mcnaughton  took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work  
it doesnt provide cheapjack explanations for henrys behavior  it shows him up for what he is  an unrepentant and unidolizable man who killed when the mood struck him  
at the films opening  henrys friend ottis toole has a sister  who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago  
in a viciously riveting scene  he admits matteroffactly to having murdered his own mother  and she covers his hand with hers  
they are damned together from that moment on  
henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun  
the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it  theres a scene where the two go to buy a new tv  
the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words  and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron  
no preface  it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker  
in a scene which many damned the movie for  unseen  they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household  playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment  
the movie itself  however  does not glorify the killings  but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work  only irritation  
henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting  
michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame  just standing there  and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well  
the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton  but he decided to give them something more memorable  and consequently the film nearly didnt see release  
the film does not glorify or justify  it just shows us  with unflinching coldness  what henry was  
im hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of  victim  or  hero   
then again  probably  so would henry
